1	NFU complains of ‘loopholes’ allowing corporations to exceed land limits, but government info under wrapsThe National Farmers Union on P.E.I. continues to raise concerns about corporate land ownership in the province, alleging "loopholes" in the province's Lands Protection Act are allowing corporations to exceed limits on the amount of land they can own.But it's a topic the provincial government isn't prepared to discuss, referring calls and questions to the Island Regulatory and Appeals Commission.And while IRAC receives annual reports from landowners whose holdings exceed 75 per cent of land limits, the commission says those reports are confidential.When P.E.I.'s Lands Protection Act was introduced in the 1980s it set limits on land ownership of 1,000 acres for individuals, and 3,000 acres for corporations.Those limits have nearly doubled in recent years with allowances for leased land and non-arable land to 1,900 acres for individuals and 5,700 acres for corporations.But for years the National Farmers Union has been raising concerns about government enforcement of the limits. On Saturday the group held a public forum with the title Land Grabbing on P.E.I.When we talk about the lands protection and the loopholes that are being violated or circumvented, what we mean is the spirit and the intent of the act is being violated, Doug Campbell, P.E.I. district director for the National Farmers Union told CBC.The letter of the law, we're not suggesting that's not being followed. But certainly the spirit and the intent of the whole act and what it was meant to achieve is definitely being violated.The NFU and others have raised concerns about one particular series of applications currently before IRAC.According to filings on the IRAC website, three corporations have submitted 32 applications to purchase parcels of land totalling 2,221 acres in the Summerside area currently owned by Brendel Farms Ltd.The three corporations which have made the applications include Galloway Farms Ltd., Long River Farms Ltd. and Indian River Farms Ltd. The newest of the three corporations, Galloway Farms, was registered as a corporation in the province on Feb. 5.The three farm corporations each list one or more of the same members of the Irving family as shareholders and directors — including Mary Jean Irving and her two daughters, Rebecca and Elizabeth Irving.Mary Jean Irving, president of Indian River Farms, spoke to CBC News.As you know there are applications before IRAC, she said. All I can say to you at this point … is I've been on the Island and growing potatoes for 29 years. I'm blessed to have two daughters that are interested in farming and have been working. So their application is in that they have for their farms.Irving said she did not want to discuss the operation of the three farm corporations publicly or provide any public comment as to whether the three corporations are connected.CBC also contacted Mary Keith, vice-president of communication for J.D. Irving Ltd. In an email response she wrote that neither J.D. Irving nor its subsidiary Cavendish Farms are involved with the proposed land purchases.P.E.I.'s Lands Protection Act does include measures to prevent corporations directly or indirectly controlled by the same person, group or organization from stacking up land limits in order to control more land. But neither the government nor IRAC agreed to an interview to talk about how the legislation is interpreted and enforced.The legislation also sets out that corporations in which the same people own more than five per cent of the shares count together in terms of the land limits. The legislation requires corporations owning more than 2,250 acres to submit annual land holding declarations which include the names of shareholders who own more than five per cent of the shares.A spokesperson for IRAC told CBC the commission reviews each corporation filing a declaration each year, but said the results of those reviews are confidential. The commission also said the size of the land holdings of corporations who submit declarations are also confidential.PC MLA Brad Trivers said he's been raising concerns about ownership as a member of the standing committee on communities, land and environment for the past two years.While the committee has heard from a number of witnesses — including representatives of Cavendish Farms last November — the committee has not delivered any recommendations on the issue.The most frustrating part of it is, it's such an important issue … and we've made very little progress, Trivers said.Trivers said government needs to be more transparent with existing records on land ownership to let Islanders know how much land is controlled by corporations and non-residents.We need real data so we can look at this in an intelligent and informed way.Trivers said some Islanders are trying to figure out who owns what by scouring through cabinet approvals for land purchases, trying to link those to names in the provincial corporate registry and property IDs in the provincial land database.That's not the way we should be doing this. We need the government to come forward, and verify using their official records how much land is actually owned by corporations, how much land is owned by non-residents, and what are the connections between corporations.So it comes down to opening up.In April 2018 Minister of Communities, Land and Environment Richard Brown said he'd asked IRAC to conduct a major review of land ownership on P.E.I. to see whether anyone was breaking the rules. At the time he said he hoped the review would be ready to present to committee by the fall of 2018.Government says a report on corporate and non-resident land ownership has now been delivered and will be released following a review by the department. However government says a separate review of the Lands Protection Act is yet to be completed.The National Farmers Union says time is of the essence, and says it's trying to make land ownership an issue in the coming provincial election.We are in a crisis mode here with our land, said Campbell. It has to be dealt with.	0
2	Veteran Democratic operative Donna Brazile finally admitted that she used her former position as a CNN commentator to relay questions ahead of debates to Hillary Clinton during the Democratic primary.For months, Brazile has avoided confirming that hacked emails from the campaign showed her forwarding the questions, which were asked at separate debates. But in a new essay for Time magazine looking back on the hackings, she said it was true."[I]n October, a subsequent release of emails revealed that among the many things I did in my role as a Democratic operative and [Democratic National Committee] Vice Chair prior to assuming the interim D.N.C. Chair position was to share potential town hall topics with the Clinton campaign," she said.As recently as February, Brazile would only say that the emails "allegedly" showed her forwarding the questions.In her Time essay, however, she said she was remorseful."My job was to make all our Democratic candidates look good, and I worked closely with both campaigns to make that happen," she said. "But sending those emails was a mistake I will forever regret."Brazile has since resigned from CNN.	0
3	BLACKWOOD, N.J. — Hillary Clinton on Wednesday mocked Donald J. Trump as evasive and secretive after he suggested that he would not release his tax returns before the November election, which would be a break with 40 years of political precedent.But Mr. Trump quickly hit back, saying that he still intended to release his tax returns as soon as a federal audit was completed — and that Mrs. Clinton was hitting him out of desperation.Mrs. Clinton, at a rally here to open her campaign for the New Jersey primary on June 7, had just begun attacking Mr. Trump’s proposed tax cuts for wealthy Americans when a man in the audience called out, “What about his tax returns?”Mrs. Clinton, who often ignores catcalls, smiled and said, “We’ll get to that.”Moments later she urged the man and other voters to keep asking to see Mr. Trump’s tax filings and indicated that her campaign would make them an issue in the general election, saying, “We’ll get around to that, too.”“Because when you’re running for president and you become the nominee, that’s kind of expected,” said Mrs. Clinton, who, with her husband, former President Bill Clinton, has released annual tax returns since 1977 and posted eight years of returns on her campaign website.“So you’ve got to ask yourself, why doesn’t he want to release them?” Mrs. Clinton said with a slightly dark edge to her voice. “Yeah, well, we’re going to find out.”The tax filings are a ripe target for the Clinton campaign given that Mr. Trump has been portraying her as the candidate with something to hide, attacking her for using a private email server as secretary of state and earning millions of dollars for paid speeches that have not been made public.Clinton advisers have also been seeking fresh lines of attack on Mr. Trump’s character, given that he has begun criticizing Mrs. Clinton as an “enabler” of Mr. Clinton’s extramarital behavior. By seizing on the tax issue, rather than responding directly to Mr. Trump’s broadsides, the Clinton campaign could undermine Mr. Trump’s attempt to sit in judgment of the character and transparency of the Clintons.Mr. Trump, who had said for months that he would release his returns for voters to scrutinize, opened himself up for criticism after he told The Associated Press, in an interview published on Wednesday, that he did not plan to release his returns before the general election.“There’s nothing to learn from them,” Mr. Trump told The A.P., explaining that he did not think voters were particularly interested in the contents of his returns.Mr. Trump, in a telephone interview later on Wednesday, said he was following legal advice by not releasing his tax returns until the “very unfair government audit” was complete.“I will release them as soon as the audit is done. I hope that’s soon,” he said. “I’d like to do it before the election.”Mr. Trump added that he thought Mrs. Clinton was attacking him because she was struggling to win over voters and beat Senator Bernie Sanders for the Democratic nomination.Making tax returns public is not required of presidential candidates, but there is a long tradition of major party nominees doing so. Joseph J. Thorndike, who tracks presidential tax returns as the director of the Tax History Project at the nonpartisan Tax Analysts, said Mr. Trump would be the first major candidate since 1976 to not make any of his full returns public. President Gerald R. Ford released a summary of his tax returns that year.Dr. Thorndike noted that President Richard M. Nixon released his tax returns while he was under audit, starting the tradition of presidential candidates making their returns public.“I think 40 years of tradition carries real moral and ethical weight,” Dr. Thorndike said. “It is quite striking that a major candidate would decide not to release their tax information — especially someone with an admittedly complex tax situation.”Among the most prominent people to call on Mr. Trump to release his returns this year has been Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential nominee, who did not want to release his tax returns but finally relented under pressure. One of the people who encouraged him to do so was Mr. Trump, who said that Mr. Romney should be proud of his wealth and not hold back his financial information.At her New Jersey rally, Mrs. Clinton highlighted Mr. Trump’s tax returns to reinforce a broader point about his approach to taxation, portraying him as a billionaire businessman who was concerned only with his own interests and those of fellow wealthy Americans.She said that his tax plan — which envisions a top tax rate of 25 percent, compared with the current maximum rate of 39.6 percent — would provide $3 trillion in tax relief to millionaires and billionaires over the next decade, a figure that her campaign attributed to an analyst at a left-leaning think tank. She also cited studies showing that the plan would add $34 trillion to the national debt over 20 years.“Donald Trump’s tax plan was written by a billionaire for billionaires,” Mrs. Clinton said, adding that $3 trillion would be “enough money to make Social Security and Medicare solvent for the next 75 years.”Mrs. Clinton was blunt about her own tax plans, noting that she would target the wealthy and rule out any tax increases on middle-class Americans.“I do want to raise rich people’s taxes because they have benefited the most from the economy in the last 15 years,” she said to cheers from several hundred union workers, college students, professors and others gathered in a gym at Camden County College. “It’s time they paid their fair share for America’s prosperity and our success.”	0
4	CUCUTA, Venezuela/Colombia border – As Venezuela continues to crumble under the socialist dictatorship of President Nicolas Maduro, some are expressing words of warning – and resentment – against a six-year-old gun control bill that stripped citizens of their weapons.“Guns would have served as a vital pillar to remaining a free people, or at least able to put up a fight,” Javier Vanegas, 28, a Venezuelan teacher of English now exiled in Ecuador, told Fox News. “The government security forces, at the beginning of this debacle, knew they had no real opposition to their force. Once things were this bad, it was a clear declaration of war against an unarmed population.”Under the direction of then-President Hugo Chavez, the Venezuelan National Assembly in 2012 enacted the “Control of Arms, Munitions and Disarmament Law,” with the explicit aim to “disarm all citizens.” The law took effect in 2013, with only minimal pushback from some pro-democracy opposition figures, banned the legal commercial sale of guns and munitions to all - except government entities.Chavez initially ran a months-long amnesty program encouraging Venezuelans to trade their arms for electrical goods. That year, there were only 37 recorded voluntary gun surrenders, while the majority of seizures - more than 12,500 – were by force.In 2014, with Nicolás Maduro at the helm following Chavez’s death but carrying through his socialist “Chavista” policies, the government invested more than $47 million enforcing the gun ban – which has since included grandiose displays of public weapons demolitions in the town square.A former gun store owner inside Venezuela – who told Fox News he has now been relegated to only selling fishing supplies since the ban – said he can’t sell any type of weaponry - even a slingshot - and underscored that even BB ammunition and airsoft guns are only issued to police and military officers.The punishment for illicit carrying or selling a weapon now is 20 years behind bars.Prior to the 2012 reform, there were only around eight gun stores in the entire country. And the process of obtaining a legal permit to own and carry was plagued by long wait lines, high costs and bribery “to make the process swifter” at the one department allowed to issue licenses, which operated under the umbrella of the Ministry of Defense.“Venezuelans didn’t care enough about it. The idea of having the means to protect your home was seen as only needed out in the fields. People never would have believed they needed to defend themselves against the government,” Vanegas explained. “Venezuelans evolved to always hope that our government would be non-tyrannical, non-violator of human rights, and would always have a good enough control of criminality.”He said it didn’t take long for such a wide-eyed public perception to fall apart. “If guns had been a stronger part of our culture, if there had been a sense of duty for one to protect their individual rights, and as a show of force against a government power – and had legal carry been a common thing – it would have made a huge difference,” he lamented.Since April 2017, almost 200 pro-democracy protesters in Venezuela – armed mostly with stones – were shot dead by government forces in brutal retaliation to their call to end the oppressive socialist regime. The once oil-wealthy nation has continued its downward spiral into financial ruin, extreme violence, and mass human rights violations. An estimated three million Venezuelans have been forced to flee since 2015.“Venezuela shows the deadly peril when citizens are deprived of the means of resisting the depredations of a criminal government,” said David Kopel, a policy analyst, and research director at the Independence Institute and adjunct professor of Advanced Constitutional Law at Denver University. “The Venezuelan rulers – like their Cuban masters – apparently viewed citizen possession of arms as a potential danger to a permanent communist monopoly of power.”Although the bill was sold to the population as a hardline effort to improve security, and sharply reduce crime, many now point to Venezuela as a case study for how gun prohibition can actually produce the opposite effect.The violent crime rate, already high, soared. Almost 28,000 people were murdered in 2015 – with the homicide rate becoming the world’s highest. Compare that, according to GunPolicy.org – an international firearms prevention and policy research initiative – to just under 10,000 in 2012, and 6,500 thousand in 2001, the year before Chavez came to power.The total number of gun deaths in 2013 was estimated to 14,622, having steadily risen from 10,913 in 2002. While comprehensive data now goes unrecorded by the government, in September this year, Amnesty International declared Venezuela had a murder rate “worse than some war zones” – 89 people per 100,000 people - and three times that of its volatile neighbor Brazil.Much of the crime has been attributed by analysts to government-backed gangs – referred to in Spanish as “collectivos” – who were deliberately put in place by the government.“They were set up by the government to act as proxies and exert community control. They're the guys on the motorcycles in the poor neighborhoods, who killed any protesters,” said Vanessa Neumann, the Venezuelan-American president and founder of Asymmetrica, a Washington, D.C.-based political risk research and consulting firm. “The gun reform policy of the government was about social control. As the citizenry got more desperate and hungry and angry with the political situation, they did not want them to be able to defend themselves. It was not about security; it was about a monopoly on violence and social control.”So while Venezuelan citizens were stripped of their legal recourse to bear arms, the “collectivos” – established by Chavez when came to power – were legally locked and loaded. Deemed crucial to the survival of the socialist dictatorship, the “collectivos” function to brutally subjugate opposition groups, while saving some face as they aren’t officially government forces, critics contend.Eduardo Espinel, 35, who serves as a representative for the rapidly growing Venezuelan population in the Colombian border town of Cucuta – having fled his ailing nation two years ago under the threat of being kidnapped by local gangsters – said the law had proliferated the violence by allowing the collectivos to freely and legally shoot and kill.“Everyone else but the common citizen. This law asks for the disarming of the common people, but everyone else can carry,” Espinel said. “The kind of law might make sense in a normal country, but in Venezuela, it makes no sense. People are faced with crime and have no easy means to defend themselves.”And Maribel Arias, 35, who was once a law and political science student at the University of Los Andes in her home state of Mérida but fled to the Colombian border with her family two years ago – living mostly on the streets as she and her husband take turns finding odd jobs such as selling water and attending bathrooms and while sharing the parenting duties of tending to their four children – bemoaned that they simply cannot rely on the nation’s law enforcement.“The people of Venezuela should have rights for gun carrying because there is just too much crime and people should have the right to defend themselves because the justice system is not working,” Arias asserted. “If you call the police, the police come only if they want. If they capture the criminal maybe they will take away whatever they stole, but they normally go free again. It’s a vicious cycle.”Many contend the gun ban has in some ways hurt police and law enforcement, who have themselves become a more fervent target of street gangs. There was a 14 percent increase in police murders in 2016. And more than 80 percent of assailants subsequently stole the officer’s gun, according to Insight Crime.Some experts contend many of the weapons and ammunition used by gangsters were once in the hands of government forces, and obtained either through theft or purchase from corrupt individuals.And adding to the complication, the ranks of the police force are beleaguered by crime and corruption. “Crimes are committed by police, a lot of the criminals are police themselves,” said Saul Moros, 59, from the Venezuelan city of Valencia.Luis Farias, 48, from Margarita, said that gun violence was indeed bad when guns were freely available for purchase. But it became much worse after the gun ban was passed. “Now the criminal mother is unleashed,” Farias said. “Trying to ban guns didn’t take guns off the streets. Nobody cares about the law; the criminals don’t care about the law.”A black market in weapons is also thriving. There are an estimated six million unregistered firearms circulating in Venezuela, but they remain far from reach for the average, non-criminal Venezuelan.“The black market of weapons is very active, mostly used by violent criminals,” said Johan Obdola, a former counter-narcotics chief in Venezuela and now president of Latin America-focused, Canada-based global intelligence and security firm IOSI. “Venezuelans simply looking to protect themselves from the regime are totally vulnerable.”Prices vary daily. But an AR-15 rifle goes for around $500, sources said, while handguns sell for about $250. Those prices are far beyond the reach of the average Venezuelan.“Most guns can be bought illegally in a sort of pyramid structure. A big irregular group or criminal organization has the best access to weapons directly from the government, and they sometimes even get access to basically new unused weaponry," explained Vanegas. "The longer down the pyramid you are, you must get your weapon from the nearest big irregular group that overpowers you within your territory. This is not an option for any moral person, due to the fact that you need to deal with criminals in order to get an illegal gun. And for many obvious reasons, people will not even consider this.”The Venezuelan government denies it is in a deeply deteriorating crisis, caused by its own policies. Rather, it blames the United States and opposition leaders for waging an “economic war.”According to Omar Adolfo Zares Sanchez, 48, a lawyer, politician, and former mayor of Campo Elías municipality in the Venezuelan state of Mérida, it is now all but too late to make guns legally accessible to the average person.“Without a doubt, if there had been a balance of armed defense we could have stood up and stopped the oppression at the beginning,” he contended. “But there is too much anarchy on the streets now. Making guns easier for anybody to buy now would start a civil war.”Other Venezuelans argue that while violence has indeed rapidly increased in the years since the gun ban, it might have been that much worse as the economy collapsed, and the country deteriorated.  “The problem from the beginning and still now is that there are too many people in Venezuela who are lawless. Crime is a way of living,” said Emberly Quiroz, 25, mother of three. “Access to weapons won’t solve the problem.”	0
5	Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton announced today that she is seeking the Democratic presidential nomination for the 2016 election."I'm running for president," she says in a video posted this afternoon on the website hillaryclinton.com. "Americans have fought their way back from tough economic times, but the deck is still stacked in favor of those at the top. Everyday Americans need a champion. I want to be that champion.On Friday, NPR and other news organizations quoted sources familiar with Clinton's campaign as saying she would make her announcement official today.The former U.S. senator from New York is the first Democrat to officially announce a presidential run — and she's by far the favorite to win the nomination. Likely Democratic candidates include Vice President Joe Biden, Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley and Jim Webb, a former U.S. senator from Virginia who previously served as President Reagan's secretary of the Navy.As New York magazine wrote in an April 5 profile:"A lot can happen between now and then, but barring something truly unprecedented and totally unforeseen — a meteorite, a Benghazi revelation, a health scare, or a Martin O'Malley groundswell — on July 28, 2016, Hillary Clinton will step onto a stage in Philadelphia. There, surrounded by red-white-and-blue bunting and balloons — as well as Bill, Chelsea, baby granddaughter Charlotte, and tens of thousands of screaming Democrats — she will officially become her party's presidential nominee."Polls also show the former first lady leading all her possible Republican rivals in a 2016 matchup. But at a similar juncture in 2007, she was the favorite to win her party's presidential nomination for 2008 — a contest she lost to then-Sen. Barack Obama.Clinton also faces questions about her use of a personal email account while secretary of state, about her role in the Benghazi controversy, and about funds raised by the Clinton Foundation from foreign governments during her tenure at the State Department.In a response to Clinton's announcement, the Republican National Committee issued a statement calling her trust into question."Over decades as a Washington insider, Clinton has left a trail of secrecy, scandal, and failed policies that can't be erased from voters' minds. The Clintons believe they can play by a different set of rules and think they're above transparency, accountability, and ethics," the RNC statement said.You can follow more detailed coverage of this story on our It's All Politics blog here.	0
6	Russia announced statistics that China dumped black caviar at Russia at ultra-low prices.Vasily Sokolov, deputy director of the Russian Federal Fisheries Agency, revealed on February 18 that the amount of black caviar exported by China to Russia has increased significantly in recent years. In the past three years alone, the number of black caviar exports from China to Russia has increased from 3.5 tons to nearly 18 tons, a five-fold increase. He also stressed that the figure is only official official import and export trade data, rather than the amount of regular imported black caviar, no one can count the specific figures. But no doubt, China's caviar has already taken up a very large share of the Russian market. The Deputy Director of the Russian Federal Fisheries Agency also stated that Chinese suppliers have adopted the dumping method of exporting to the Russian market at an ultra-low price. If the cost of black caviar in Russian domestic fisheries is as high as $500-600 per kilogram, then the price of black caviar from Chinese suppliers is $200 per kilogram. Russia’s “Viewpoint” reported on the 18th that most of the black caviar produced in China will be repackaged after importing into Russia, using Russian own trademarks and packaging, all of which are “made in Russia”. Ordinary consumers simply can't tell. Russian experts explained that China's black caviar is repackaged and resold with Russian brand names because Chinese goods have a poor reputation and will not be trusted by consumers if they are sold directly. Russian fishery news agency expert Alexander Saviliyev commented: "After continuous exposure, the Russian public now know that China's aquaculture industry uses a lot of hormones and various unknown chemicals in order to promote, It shortens its spawning period. If Russian carp is seeded for 7-8 years, it takes less than 4 years in China. At the same time, chemicals are commonly used during storage and transportation.” Recently, Russian law enforcement agencies The case of the capture of a batch of black caviar imported from China in Khabarovsk, not far from the Chinese border, shocked Russian society. A long-distance car with a coffin in a local funeral parlour was parked for speeding and found 500 kg of Chinese caviar in the coffin on the car.Alexander Novikov, chairman of the Russian "Squid Breeding Federation" commented: "Because of the high price, fake and shoddy caviar has been repeatedly banned, law enforcement agencies should formulate regulations requiring businesses to indicate the place of origin and packaging on the goods, so that Consumers know if this is Russia's own caviar. However, for the Russian media to constantly promote the "Chinese chemical black caviar" approach, some Chinese fisheries farmers responded that this is a reputation for deliberately discrediting Chinese products. Some Russian and former Soviet republics have imported black caviar from China at a very low price and then repackaged and sold it to the Russian market at a high price.

7	Former Secretary of State and presidential candidate Hillary Clinton offered a stark view of the country on Sunday, comparing the current “crisis in our democracy” to the turbulence that occurred amid the Civil Rights movement of the 1960s.Speaking during a reception in Selma, Ala. to mark the 54th anniversary of "Bloody Sunday” and to receive the International Unity Award at the Martin Luther King and Coretta Scott King Unity Breakfast, Clinton said that the United States is facing a "full-fledged crisis in our democracy.""This is a time, my friends, when fundamental rights, civic virtue, freedom of the press, the rule of law, truth, facts and reason are under assault," Clinton said, according to the Hill.Clinton is one of a number of Democratic leaders in Selma this weekend for the ceremonies surrounding the “Bloody Sunday” anniversary.Not to be confused with the “Bloody Sunday” massacre in Northern Ireland in 1972, the events being remembered in Alabama occurred on March 7, 1965, when peaceful demonstrators were beaten back by Alabama state troopers as they attempted to cross the Edmund Pettus Bridge. It was a moment that galvanized support for the passage of the Voting Rights Act later that year.While Clinton did not specifically mention President Trump in her speech, she said that “racist and white supremacist views” have been buoyed by the current administration and warned that civil and voting rights were under attack in the U.S."To anyone who has ever wondered what you would have done during those defining moments that we read about in history books -- whether you would have risked arrest to demand votes for women or bled on the Edmund Pettus bridge to demand voting rights for all -- the answer is what you are doing now could be as important as anything that anyone has done before," Clinton said.Voter suppression emerged as a key issue in the 2018 midterm elections in states such as Georgia and North Carolina, where a Republican congressional candidate was accused of rigging the contest there through absentee ballots. House Democrats signaled they plan to make ballot access a priority in the new Congress, introducing legislation aimed at protecting voting rights in 2020 and beyond.Clinton, who lost to Trump in the 2016 presidential election and has remained a staunch critic of the current administration, was one of a number of Democrats in Alabama over the weekend. 2020 presidential hopefuls Sens. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. and Cory Booker, D-N.J., are also slated to speak in Selma.The Associated Press contributed to this report.	0
9	WASHINGTON — A year and a half before the 2020 presidential election, President Donald Trump faces formidable obstacles in his bid for re-election, according to the latest NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll.Just four in 10 voters say they would re-elect him next year; 58 percent don’t think he’s been honest and truthful regarding the Russia probe; and 60 percent disapprove of his recent national emergency declaration to build a border wall.But Democrats who want to defeat Trump have hurdles of their own. The president's job rating remains stable with nearly 90 percent of Republicans approving of his job. And a majority of Americans remain confident in the economy, believing that there won’t be a recession in the next year.Add it up, and 2020 is shaping up to be yet another close presidential race, say the Democratic and Republican pollsters who conducted the NBC/WSJ survey.“It’s a 45-55 against the president at this stage of the game,” said Democratic pollster Peter Hart.Bill McInturff, a GOP pollster, added, “As long as these economic numbers look like this, that always keeps an incumbent president in the race.And Fred Yang, another Democratic pollster, argues that the contours of the race will change once there’s an official Democratic opponent to Trump.“Another lesson we painfully learned from 2016 is that elections are a choice between candidates and not a referendum on one candidate,” he said.The NBC/WSJ poll — conducted Sunday Feb. 24 to Wednesday Feb. 27 — comes amid another turbulent week in Trump’s presidency, highlighted by the congressional testimony by his former lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen’s, failed nuclear negotiations between the United States and North Korea, and the Democratic-led House of Representatives voting to reverse Trump’s emergency declaration on the border.Still, attitudes about the president remainsteady, with 46 percent of Americans approving of Trump’s job performance — up three points from January, although that’s well within the poll’s margin of error.The top groups approving of Trump: Republicans (88 percent), rural residents (60 percent), whites without college degrees (60 percent), men (54 percent) and whites overall (54 percent).The top groups disapproving: African Americans (88 percent), Latinos (64 percent), women (61 percent), those ages 18-34 (57 percent), whites with college degrees (55 percent) and independents (51 percent).Forty-one percent of registered voters say they will “definitely” or “probably” vote for Trump in 2020, versus 48 percent who say they will “definitely” or “probably” vote for the Democratic candidate.Those numbers for Trump are worse than what Barack Obama faced at this same point in time in the 2012 cycle, when 45 percent said they’d vote for him, while 40 percent would vote for the Republican opponent.But they’re on par with Bill Clinton’s numbers in January 1995, when 38 percent said they’d vote for Clinton, versus 42 percent who said they’d pick the generic Republican candidate.Both Obama and Clinton won their re-election contests.The NBC/WSJ poll also tested 11 different presidential characteristics.The most popular: An African American (a combined 87 percent of all voters say they are “enthusiastic” or “comfortable” with that characteristic), a white man (86 percent), a woman (84 percent), and someone who is gay or lesbian (68 percent — up from 43 percent in 2006).	0
10	Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., on Sunday said there are "enormous amounts of evidence" linking the Trump campaign to Russia — the same day House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., said there's "direct evidence" of collusion between the two.The top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee disputed on NBC's "Meet the Press" recent remarks by Sen. Richard Burr, R-N.C. claiming that the committee hasn't found "factual evidence" of collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign.Warner, referring to "the litany of what we know,"  said, "the ongoing negotiations about Trump Tower, well into the campaign, I believe the fact that Mr. Trump knew about the dump of the Wikileaks material, the fact that clearly the meeting at Trump Tower meeting which was not described appropriately, in terms of offering dirt," were all evidence."To me, that's all evidence," he said. "There’s no one that could factually say there’s not plenty of evidence of collaboration or communications between Trump Organization and Russians."Warner, however, did note that he'd be withholding full judgment until the Senate Intelligence Committee finishes its investigation into the 2016 presidential campaign.Meantime on Sunday, House Intel Chair Schiff said on CBS' "Face the Nation" that he believes "there is direct evidence in the emails from the Russians through their intermediary offering dirt on Hillary Clinton as part of what is described in writing as the Russian government effort to help elect Donald Trump."“They offer that dirt. There is an acceptance of that offer in writing from the president’s son, Don Jr., and there is overt acts and furtherance of that… That to me is direct evidence," Schiff added.The Senate committee's investigation is separate from that of Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who is also probing Russian election interference, questions of collusion and possible obstruction of justice by the Trump campaign.The Associated Press contributed to this report.	0
11	Longtime Fox News president Roger Ailes fed Donald Trump debate questions, according to a lengthy new investigation from the New Yorker.The piece, written by Jane Mayer and published on Monday in advance of their March issue, says that even Megyn Kelly’s famously tough question to Trump about his past remarks toward women were slipped to the billionaire in advance.“A pair of Fox insiders and a source close to Trump believe that Ailes informed the Trump campaign about Kelly’s question,” Mayer said. “Two of those sources say that they know of the tipoff from a purported eyewitness. In addition, a former Trump campaign aide says that a Fox contact gave him advance notice of a different debate question, which asked the candidates whether they would support the Republican nominee, regardless of who won.”Both instances were significant moments for Trump early in his race for the White House. The spat with Kelly helped cement his reputation as a shameless outsider and ignited a feud that made Kelly a household name but severely damaged her standing among the network’s diehard viewers. Trump’s defiant refusal to promise his eventual support for the eventual Republican nominee made him an instant establishment bête noire.A rep for Fox News directed TheWrap to a denial they issued to the New Yorker. A rep for the White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Ailes died in 2017 and with him likely went the full truth about the incident. The story, however, has percolated in media circles for years and has been denied in the past by several of those involved — including Kelly.“For the record, my book ‘Settle for More’ does not suggest Trump had any debate Qs in advance, nor do I believe that he did,” she said in a 2016 tweet promoting her book.“[Roger Ailes] had nothing to do with our debate preparation. Nothing! It was Wallace, Baier, me, Stirewalt and Fox News Bill Sammon, that’s it,” she reiterated on her own Fox News show around the same time. “We wrote our own questions. No one told me what to write because there’s another report out there that Rupert Murdoch got involved, which he didn’t.”Kelly added that any idea to the contrary was “nonsense.”The issue of feeding debate questions to candidates was a serious one during the 2016 campaign. Former DNC official Donna Brazile continues to take heat from left wing activists over her disclosure that she ferreted along sample town hall topics to Hillary Clinton’s campaign to help give her an edge over Bernie Sanders. She has called the decision a mistake and something she would regret “forever.”	0
12	(CNN)President Donald Trump's former national security adviser and Russia investigation cooperator Michael Flynn will be a "principal witness" in the upcoming trial of his former lobbying partner -- and his statements to special counsel Robert Mueller will matter in that case too, according to court submissions on Friday.The flood of court requests from the lobbyist Bijan Kian made clear how much of the case will focus on Flynn. Kian's defense team wants every document it can get about the former Trump administration official as they prepare for trial.Kian's legal team wants "all statements, transcripts, notes, records and memoranda" from federal prosecutors that reflate to anything Flynn said to "any agent, employee, representative or elected official" of the US government.That includes investigators' memoranda of interviews Flynn gave to Mueller's legal team as they investigated the election and the Trump political operation.Those notes -- especially about Flynn lying to Vice President Mike Pence and others in the early days of the Trump administration about his contact with Russia regarding sanctions -- could help Kian's lawyers cut into his credibility at trial, Kian's lawyers wrote. They've asked for the Mueller memos on Flynn but the Justice Department won't turn them over as potentially exculpatory material for Kian, the defense team wrote.The court submissions on Friday also reveal just how long ago Flynn started helping the prosecutors with the Kian case. Prosecutors in the Eastern District of Virginia sought an interview and grand jury testimony from Flynn as early as June 2018, about six months after Mueller secured his guilty plea.Kian, also known as Bijan Rafiekian, was charged with working illegally for the Turkish government in the US and pleaded not guilty in December. His trial is scheduled for July in the Eastern District of Virginia.Flynn, Kian and another lobbying associate, the Istanbul-based businessman Kamil Ekim Alptekin, allegedly lobbied American politicians for the extradition of the Turkish cleric Fethullah Gulen, who lives in Pennsylvania. Alptekin hasn't appeared in US court to face his charges.When Flynn admitted to lying to federal investigators about his contact with the Russian ambassador as part of the special counsel probe into 2016 election interference, he also admitted to lying to the Department of Justice about the work he did with Kian in their consulting company. Flynn agreed to cooperate with Mueller's team and other prosecutors in December 2017.He has given them "substantial assistance" in criminal investigations, prosecutors have said. He has not yet been sentenced and continues to help prosecutors.Kian's legal team also seeks documents from Flynn's lawyers at the law firm Covington & Burling, which worked on the foreign lobbying submissions Flynn's company made retroactively to the Justice Department before he was charged. The law firm still defends Flynn in his criminal case.A spokesman for Covington & Burling declined to comment on Friday.	0
13	Former Colorado governor John Hickenlooper has mentioned on Monday he is working for president to problem Donald Trump, casting himself as a can-do uniter who is used to overcoming adversity and carrying out liberal objectives in a politically divided state. “I am working for president as a result of we’d like dreamers in Washington, however we additionally want to get issues finished,” Mr Hickenlooper, 67, mentioned in a video pronouncing his marketing campaign . “I have confirmed over and over again I will be able to carry other people in combination to supply the modern alternate Washington has didn’t ship.” He turns into the second one governor to go into the sprawling box, after Washington’s Jay Inslee introduced final week, and is making an attempt to solid himself as a pragmatist who too can tackle President Trump.Although as governor Mr Hickenlooper prided himself for staying above partisan fights, he has argued his file as a former governor and big-city mayor distinguishes him from a huge box of Democratic presidential aspirants who’re backing bold liberal plans on healthcare, taxes and the local weather. Mr Hickenlooper has held again on supporting Democratic rallying cries like Medicare for All and the Inexperienced New Deal to fight local weather alternate. He as soon as labored as a geologist for a petrol corporate and was once roundly criticised for telling a congressional panel he drank fracking fluid whilst arguing for the protection of the power extraction method. It was once after Mr Hickenlooper was once laid off from his geologist place all over the power bust of the 1980s that he inadvertently began on his street to politics. He opened a brewpub in a then-desolate stretch of downtown Denver that impulsively took off. That enabled him to turn into rich through construction a mini-empire of eating places and bars. It additionally resulted in him creating a quixotic run for Denver mayor in 1993.Marketing campaign advertisements featured Mr Hickenlooper feeding quarters into parking meters to protest the town’s charging for Sunday parking downtown. He received handily. As mayor, John Hickenlooper helped convince dozens of suburban towns, on occasion led through Republicans, to again a tax hike to fund a light-rail community. He was once filmed diving out of an aeroplane to suggest for a statewide poll measure to droop an anti-tax measure handed within the 1990s and make allowance the state price range to develop. When he ran for governor in 2010, he featured an advert of himself totally dressed, strolling into a bath to clean off unfavorable assaults. It is all a part of his quirky political symbol – he vows to not run assault advertisements and has often made amusing of his tendency to misspeak and get lost political message.“As a thin child with Coke bottle glasses and a humorous final identify, I have stood as much as my fair proportion of bullies,” he says of Donald Trump.	0
14	House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., said on Sunday that he thinks a 2016 offer for dirt on Hillary Clinton by a Russian lawyer to members of the Trump campaign and the subsequent meeting is “direct evidence” of collusion on the part of the president’s team.“I think there is direct evidence in the emails from the Russians through their intermediary offering dirt on Hillary Clinton as part of what is described in writing as the Russian government effort to help elect Donald Trump," Schiff said during an appearance on Sunday on CBS’ “Face The Nation."Schiff added: “They offer that dirt. There is an acceptance of that offer in writing from the president’s son, Don Jr., and there is overt acts and furtherance of that… That to me is direct evidence.”The California lawmaker, who has been one of Trump’s fiercest critics, said that besides the meeting with the Russian lawyer, there is a slew of circumstantial evidence suggesting collusion between Trump and Russia – pointing out the charges brought against former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and the testimony last week on Capitol Hill of President Trump’s former personal attorney Michael Cohen.Schiff, however, stopped short of calling for impeachment."That is something that we will have to await Bob Mueller's report and the underlying evidence to determine. We will also have to look at the whole body of improper and criminal actions by the president including those campaign finance crimes to determine whether they rise to the level of removal from office," Schiff said.Last month Schiff announced a broad new investigation looking not only at Russian interference, but also at Trump's foreign financial interests.Schiff said the investigation will include "the scope and scale" of Russian intervention in the 2016 presidential election, the "extent of any links and/or coordination" between Russians and Trump's associates, whether foreign actors have sought to hold leverage over Trump or his family and associates, and whether anyone has sought to obstruct any of the relevant investigations.The committee interviewed Cohen in private on Thursday and will finish the interview this coming Wednesday. After Cohen left, Schiff announced that the committee will hold an open hearing later this month with Felix Sater, a Russia-born executive who worked with Cohen on an ultimately unsuccessful deal to build a Trump Tower in Moscow.The Associated Press contributed to this report.	0
15	President Trump asserted Saturday his notorious call during the 2016 presidential election for Russia to find Hillary Clinton’s missing emails was made in jest and not intended to be taken seriously.“With the fake news, if you tell a joke, if you’re sarcastic, if you’re having fun with the audience, if you’re on live television with millions of people and 25,000 people in an arena, and if you say something like, ‘Russia, please if you can, get us Hillary Clinton’s emails. Please, Russia, please. Please, get us the emails, please,’” Trump said during a wide-ranging speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Maryland, as chants of “Lock her up” broke out among the crowd.“So everybody is having a good time, I’m laughing, we’re all having fun. Then, that fake CNN and others say, ‘He asked Russia to go get the emails. Horrible,’” Trump said.The president went on to accuse the press of being “sick.”“I’m telling you, they know the game, and they play it dirty, dirtier than anybody has ever played the game,” said Trump. “Dirtier than it’s ever been played.”The president came under intense scrutiny for his July 2016 appeal to Russia, which some said was a call for a foreign government to hack his political opponent and interfere in the election. Special counsel Robert Mueller is currently investigating Russia’s meddling in the 2016 election and whether members of the Trump campaign colluded with Russia.“I will tell you this: Russia, if you’re listening, I hope you’re able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing,” the president said during that 2016 event in Florida. “I think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press.”Federal prosecutors alleged in an indictment filed against 12 Russians by Mueller last year that they began attempting to hack Clinton’s personal email server the day Trump called for Russia to find her deleted emails.	0
16	HANOI, Vietnam — As President Trump settled into the dining room of a French-colonial hotel in Hanoi on Thursday morning, the conversation with Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader with whom he had struck up the oddest of friendships, was already turning tense.In a dinner at the Metropole Hotel the evening before, mere feet from the bomb shelter where guests took cover during the Vietnam War, Mr. Kim had resisted what Mr. Trump presented as a grand bargain: North Korea would trade all its nuclear weapons, material and facilities for an end to the American-led sanctions squeezing its economy.An American official later described this as “a proposal to go big,” a bet by Mr. Trump that his force of personality, and view of himself as a consummate dealmaker, would succeed where three previous presidents had failed.But Mr. Trump’s offer was essentially the same deal that the United States has pushed — and the North has rejected — for a quarter-century. Intelligence agencies had warned him, publicly, Mr. Kim would not be willing to give up the arsenal completely. North Korea itself had said repeatedly that it would only move gradually.Several of Mr. Trump’s own aides, led by national security adviser John R. Bolton and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, thought the chances of a grand bargain for total nuclear disarmament were virtually zero. Some questioned whether the summit meeting should go forward.Mr. Trump disagreed. He had taken to showing what he called Mr. Kim’s “beautiful letters” to visitors to the Oval Office, as evidence he had built a rapport with one of the world’s most brutal dictators. While some in the White House worried Mr. Trump was being played, the president seemed entranced — even declaring “we fell in love.”As Mr. Trump and Mr. Kim parted company, nearly a year of optimism and flattery was left poolside at the Metropole, steps from a meeting room with two empty chairs and flags that had been carefully prepared for a “signing ceremony.”Mr. Trump and senior diplomats say they hope negotiations will continue, though nothing has been scheduled. Mr. Kim has promised not to resume weapons testing, and the Pentagon continues to hold off on large-scale military exercises with South Korea.In interviews with a half-dozen participants, it is clear Mr. Trump’s failed gambit was the culmination of two years of threats, hubris and misjudgment on both sides. Mr. Trump entered office convinced he could intimidate the man he liked to call “Little Rocket Man” with tough talk and sanctions, then abruptly took the opposite tack, overruling his aides and personalizing the diplomacy.Editors’ PicksWhat Is Glitter?Bigger, Saltier, Heavier: Fast Food Since 1986 in 3 Simple ChartsThe New 30-SomethingMr. Kim also miscalculated. He bet Mr. Trump might accept a more modest offer that American negotiators in Hanoi had already dismissed: The North would dismantle the Yongbyon nuclear complex, three square miles of aging facilities at the heart of the nuclear program, for an end to the sanctions most harmful to its economy, those enacted since 2016.It is unclear whether Mr. Trump was tempted to take that deal, which could have turned headlines away from the damaging testimony of his former lawyer, Michael D. Cohen, in Washington.But Mr. Pompeo, who knew the details of the North Korean program intimately from his days as C.I.A. director, opposed it. The president was told that if he settled for Yongbyon alone, he might appear to have been duped by the young leader of a country renowned for hiding pieces of its nuclear program in tunnels around the country.Mr. Pompeo said later that Mr. Kim’s offer “still leaves missiles, still leaves warheads and weapons systems” — and a senior State Department official argued that sanctions relief would fund the production of more weapons.It also would have let the North continue to produce uranium, a key ingredient for nuclear weapons, at a hidden enrichment center near the capital, Pyongyang — one of several suspected nuclear sites beyond Yongbyon that the United States has been monitoring from afar for nearly a decade.“I think that they were surprised that we knew,” Mr. Trump said.In the end, the president took a brief walk with Mr. Kim around the hotel’s pool, shook his hand and then canceled lunch in a glassed pavilion.Sign up for The InterpreterSubscribe for original insights, commentary and discussions on the major news stories of the week, from columnists Max Fisher and Amanda Taub.SIGN UP“This kind of opportunity may never come again,” Ri Yong-ho, North Korea’s foreign minister, told reporters later that night.For a president who often complains that his predecessors only let the North Korea problem fester, the 8,000-mile trek from Washington to Hanoi was a crash course in why those past presidents failed.Many around Mr. Trump believe he will, too.North Korea was the first international crisis of the Trump administration, and discussion about how hard to press the country sometimes got heated. At one point, aides said they heard Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster, the national security adviser, and Jim Mattis, the defense secretary, shouting at each other behind closed doors.General McMaster was intent on signaling to both North Korea and allies that Mr. Trump was serious about enforcing sanctions and that he would not tolerate a nuclear North Korea.In a series of Situation Room meetings, the administration reviewed options to ramp up sanctions and covert operations, including an Obama-era program of cyber sabotage against North Korean missiles. War plans were rewritten, and General McMaster spoke openly about the possibility of a “preventive war” if the threat grew.The shouting was prompted by General McMaster’s insistence that Mr. Mattis intercept North Korean ships on the high seas to determine whether they were engaged in sanctions busting. But Mr. Mattis resisted, worried that the outbreak of a firefight at sea could quickly escalate out of control.Mr. Kim, for his part, turned up the pressure, launching missile after missile, including new intercontinental ballistic models that appeared capable of hitting the United States. There was also another nuclear test, which some experts believe may have been a hydrogen bomb, as the North claimed.But for more than a year, Mr. Trump shut down efforts at diplomacy.When Rex Tillerson, the secretary of state at the time, told reporters during a visit to Beijing that “we have a couple, three channels open to Pyongyang,” Mr. Trump lashed out, declaring on Twitter that “only one thing will work” and casting his own secretary of state as naïve. Mr. Tillerson fumed and was later ousted.Early in 2018, though, Mr. Trump suddenly changed course — along the lines Mr. Tillerson had advocated. To the shock of Mr. Trump’s own advisers, he accepted on the spot when envoys sent by South Korea’s president, Moon Jae-in, passed on an invitation to meet Mr. Kim.After that first summit meeting in Singapore in June, the talk of hostilities ended. Mr. Trump declared Mr. Kim an honorable partner — gliding past the murder of his half brother, his uncle and an American student in North Korea, Otto Warmbier — and promised to improve relations and suspend military exercises around Korea.“There is no longer a Nuclear Threat from North Korea,” Mr. Trump declared on Twitter, despite the absence of any timetable for denuclearization.Some of his aides, starting with Mr. Bolton, the new national security adviser, were appalled. But with Mr. Trump repeating that he should be awarded a Nobel Peace Prize, no one wanted to argue.Mr. Bolton told colleagues not to worry. The negotiations, he said, would collapse on their own.There were signs of trouble from the start.Mr. Pompeo flew to Pyongyang in early July to turn the Singapore discussion into a timetable for the North to produce an inventory of weapons, the first step toward disarmament, but Mr. Kim declined to see him. Instead, Mr. Pompeo met with Kim Yong-chol, a former spy chief with hard-line views on the United States.After the visit, the North said the Americans had pushed a “unilateral and gangster-like demand for denuclearization.” But it also said Kim Jong-un still wanted to build on the “friendly relationship and trust” with Mr. Trump.The message was clear: A real breakthrough was only possible if the two leaders got together again. The North Koreans seemed to believe Mr. Kim could get a better deal from Mr. Trump than they could from his State Department negotiators.Then in August, Mr. Trump abruptly canceled a trip by Mr. Pompeo to Pyongyang, saying there had not been enough progress in the talks. This stymied the new special envoy, Stephen E. Biegun, who had planned to accompany Mr. Pompeo.Meanwhile, diplomacy between South Korea and North Korea was progressing quickly. Mr. Moon and Mr. Kim had already met twice before the Singapore summit, and in September, Mr. Moon made a historic visit to Pyongyang.The result was the Pyongyang Declaration, which outlined a peace process for the peninsula — and dangled a potential concession by North Korea. The North, it said, would agree to dismantle the Yongbyon complex if the United States took “corresponding measures.”Suddenly, Yongbyon was in play. But what did North Korea want?Some analysts said they believed then that the North was seeking an end-of-war declaration as a prelude to legally replacing the armistice that halted the Korean War, an idea that Mr. Trump told Mr. Kim in Singapore he supported. And Mr. Moon was pushing for the end-of-war declaration.American officials were worried it could lead too quickly to a peace treaty and then negotiations to draw down the 28,500 American troops on the peninsula — a longtime goal of the North.Then, a few days before the midterm elections in the United States, North Korea released a belligerent statement that said the country would return to a policy of strengthening its nuclear force if the United States did not lift sanctions.In retrospect, it was an important message that was obscured by the discussion of an end-of-war declaration.What really mattered to Mr. Kim were the sanctions, which, after three new rounds in 2017, were strangling his nation’s already pitiful economy. The United States had even cut off critical humanitarian aid to the country by barring American aid groups from traveling there.With diplomacy stalled, Mr. Trump decided to weigh in again.Mr. Bolton announced in December that Mr. Trump wanted another summit meeting in early 2019 because North Korea had “not lived up to the commitments” it made in Singapore. To some diplomats and analysts, that seemed like a reason not to meet again.The North Koreans appointed a former ambassador to Spain, Kim Hyok-chol, to lay the groundwork with Mr. Biegun, 55, a pragmatic former senior aide to Condoleezza Rice in the Bush administration who had been passed over for the national security adviser position in favor of Mr. Bolton.The first meetings in Pyongyang did not go smoothly. And when the two sides met in Hanoi starting six days before the summit meeting, the North Koreans kept demanding that the five most recent rounds of sanctions imposed by the United Nations since March 2016 be lifted.Mr. Ri, the foreign minister, said later that North Korea chose those sanctions because they affected ordinary citizens.These sanctions, imposed to punish Pyongyang for new weapons tests, differed from previous restrictions that were focused on weapons and nuclear-related equipment. Instead, they covered entire export sectors, including minerals, metals, coal, agriculture and seafood.They also banned energy sales to North Korea. Altogether, they held back billions of dollars of trade, a senior State Department official said.The far-reaching nature of the sanctions — and the suffering they were causing — were exactly why hard-line administration officials wanted to keep them up. After Mr. Trump’s surprise decision at Singapore to suspend military exercises with South Korea, these officials worried the United States was losing leverage.That camp, led by Mr. Bolton, regarded Mr. Pompeo and his diplomats with suspicion. Would they give away too much for too little? Would they give in to the North Korean entreaties to loosen sanctions?A Stanford speech by Mr. Biegun in January appeared to the hawks to be a red flag: He suggested then that North Korea might not need to immediately hand over a complete declaration of nuclear assets, which American officials had demanded as a first step.But behind closed doors, Mr. Biegun and his team told the North Koreans that giving up the aging facilities at Yongbyon was not nearly enough for such extensive sanctions relief.At the same time, the North Korean negotiators were inconsistent about which of the facilities inside Yongbyon they were offering to dismantle — at one point saying that only Kim Jong-un could decide.The negotiating teams were still deadlocked even as Mr. Kim boarded a train for a two-day journey to Vietnam and Mr. Trump took off on Air Force One.The American team thought their North Korean counterparts would warn Mr. Kim that the demand to lift the five sanctions was a non-starter, so the two leaders would work on hashing something else out during the summit meeting.But soon after the two men arrived at the Metropole, the North Korean leader began arguing for relief from the five rounds of sanctions in exchange for Yongbyon.While North Korea had suspended operations at Yongbyon under agreements in 1994 and again in 2007, and later offered various moratoriums that were never fully executed, Mr. Kim’s proposal appeared to go further than ever toward dismantling the entirety of the complex, officials said. But the exact terms were still vague.Mr. Trump countered with the grand bargain. The divide was underscored by the fact that, at one point, he presented Mr. Kim with a document laying out his definition of denuclearization.Mr. Kim objected that there was not enough trust between the two countries to give up everything at once.At a rare news conference shortly after midnight on Thursday, Mr. Ri argued that his country mostly needed “security guarantees” related to American military forces on the peninsula, and portrayed the sanctions-for-Yongbyon trade as a step to build trust.In the end, Mr. Trump flew back to Washington with nothing — no agreement on a peace declaration, and no ban on producing more nuclear fuel — meaning the North’s arsenal will keep expanding while the two sides argue. There were only promises to keep talking.On Friday, as Mr. Trump woke up in the White House after his grueling trip, the long wooden table that had been moved into a meeting room of the Metropole Hotel for the signing ceremony still sat there, unused.Correction: March 2, 2019An earlier version of this article misspelled the surname of an American student who died after being held captive in North Korea.

17	President Trump's former personal attorney and rat, Michael Cohen, was questioned in a heated, all day hearing in front of the House Oversight Committee this week.Despite Cohen’s scathing opening remarks, there were three key takeaways from his hearing:1. Cohen said, under oath, that he did not take a trip to Prague to collude with Russia on behalf of then-candidate Donald Trump. Cohen stated that he did not have any evidence whatsoever of any collusion between the Trump Campaign and Russia.2. Cohen said that he did not seek a position in the Trump administration. Many in the President’s inner-circle, as well as acquaintances of Cohen's have taken to Twitter to deny that ridiculous claim. That may mean that Cohen perjured himself again in his Congressional testimony. If so, Cohen could face additional jail time on top of the 3 years that he’s due to start serving in May.3. Cohen repeatedly called himself a liar – exposing his bias against the president and making a total fool out of himself.Here’s the bottom line: The good news for Democrats? They got an opportunity to continue to talk about President Trump and the Russia investigation for just a little longer.The bad news? Cohen’s testimony exposed their narrative for what it is: totally fabricated nonsense.	0
18	Donald Trump's former lawyer Michael Cohen was fully co-operative during closed-door testimony before a congressional committee investigating Russia's interference in the 2016 US election, the panel's chairman says.House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, a Democrat, said Cohen would return on March 6 to allow another chance to follow up on allegations of wrongdoing Cohen levelled at his former boss this week."I think we all feel it was a very productive interview today where he was able to shed light on a lot of issues very important to our investigation. We were able to drill down in great detail," Schiff told reporters on Thursday.Schiff said the panel will also talk to Felix Sater, a Russian-born property developer and former business associate of Trump, in a public session on March 14 about efforts to build a Trump tower in Moscow.Sater, who worked with Cohen on the project while Trump was running for president, has said he and Cohen at one point talked about giving a $US50 million ($A70 million) penthouse to Russian President Vladimir Putin as a way to justify raising the prices of other units in the envisioned tower.Cohen pleaded guilty last year to lying to Congress about the Moscow project but Schiff said he answered all of the panel's questions. The testimony will eventually be made public, he said.Cohen has spoken before three congressional panels examining Russian election meddling and any collusion with the Trump campaign.In dramatic public testimony on Wednesday before the House Oversight Committee, Trump's one-time "fixer" accused the president of breaking the law while in office and said for the first time Trump knew in advance about a WikiLeaks dump of stolen emails that hurt his 2016 election opponent Hillary Clinton.Committee chairman Elijah Cummings, a Democrat, said his panel would further investigate issues raised by Cohen's testimony and may try to get the president's son, Donald Trump Jr, and his former accountant, Allen Weisselberg, to testify.Other Democrats say they will try to verify whether Trump manipulated financial statements to reduce taxes and secure bank loans, as Cohen alleged.Democratic Representative Jim Himes said Thursday's closed-door format allowed them to explore in depth some of the issues Cohen raised on Wednesday, as well as other subjects.Cohen is to begin a three-year prison sentence for lying to Congress about the Moscow tower project, along with other charges.He submitted a statement in 2017 saying efforts to build the tower had ceased by January 2016, when those talks in fact continued until June of that year, after Trump had clinched the Republican presidential nomination.	0
19	6 quotes from Mueller filing on Cohen sentencing drop hints about where his investigation is headingU.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller released two key court memos on Friday, revealing more about where his investigation into alleged collusion between the Kremlin and Donald Trump's presidential campaign is heading and what it has covered so far.The first filing released was a sentencing recommendation for Trump's former personal attorney and fixer, Michael Cohen, who has admitted to lying to Congress and also pleaded guilty to financial crimes and breaking campaign finance laws.It lays out in vague terms how Cohen aided Mueller's investigation. Cohen participated in seven interviews, spending more than 70 hours with Mueller's team.The second filing, released an hour later, laid out how former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort breached his plea agreement with the Special Counsel's Office. It details Manafort's "multiple, discernible lies" to the special counsel about his contacts with Trump administration officials and Konstantin Kilimnik, a Russian-Ukrainian political operative with suspected ties to Russian intelligence.Both documents hint at how strong Mueller's hand is, former prosecutors said, and offer hints of his progress.Legal experts who spoke with CBC News were most compelled by the Cohen document. It suggests Trump was interested in meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, and also mentions previously undisclosed contacts between Cohen and Russians.The filing also makes multiple references to Mueller's team having corroboration on Cohen's story.Legal experts highlighted a few key lines. Here's what they say the document suggests about what Mueller's team believes:1) Russians were tying Trump's business interests with his political ambitions"The defendant recalled that this person repeatedly proposed a meeting between Individual 1 and the President of Russia. The person told Cohen that such a meeting could have a 'phenomenal' impact 'not only in political but in a business dimension as well,' referring to the Moscow Project..."Mueller is referencing conversations in 2015 between Cohen and a Kremlin-linked contact promising access to Putin. In other words, "synergy on a government level," as the offer was described in the brief.  "Individual 1" refers to Donald Trump. The proposed business prospect is Trump Tower Moscow. Although Cohen originally told Congress the talks for the project ended in January 2016, he now admits he pursued a deal to build a tower in the Russian capital until June 2016, just months before the presidential election.The wording suggests Cohen knew about a pitch from Russian nationals to co-ordinate Trump's business interests with his political ambitions, said former federal prosecutor Barbara McQuade."It sounds like the Russians were trying to pitch this as a great partnership, not only in business, but also in politics," she said. "Was Russia trying to say 'play ball with us on politics and we'll make this deal with you?'"2) Cohen implicates Trump — in a footnote"The defendant admitted that … he had in fact conferred with Individual 1 about contacting the Russian government before reaching out to gauge Russia's interest in such a meeting."Trump has denied speaking with Russians during the 2016 election campaign. Cohen is now contradicting Trump.Cohen now says "he had in fact conferred with" Trump about contacting the Kremlin in 2015. Later, Cohen gave a radio interview suggesting that Putin and Trump meet in New York.The meeting never took place.3) Cohen may have been subject to witness tampering"Cohen described the circumstances of preparing and circulating his response to the congressional inquiries."That sounds like an accusation of witness tampering to former federal prosecutor Barak Cohen. Why else, he asks, would Mueller use a sentencing memo to detail insight regarding the former Trump attorney's interviews with prosecutors? Unless it's significant to the probe, it strikes him as an odd detail to include.Fired FBI chief Comey agrees to testify for 2nd day before House panelsTrump says he'll name William Barr as new U.S. attorney generalInstead, Mueller appears to be saying he has evidence relevant to his investigation describing directions Michael Cohen received before testifying."'Circulate' is an interesting word," McQuade added. "Who did he circulate this too? Cohen had a written statement [to Congress]. So did he write those things and send it around to various people to ask, 'Does this look right?'"Aside from witness tampering, she said, such actions could amount to conspiracy to obstruct justice before Cohen's 2017 congressional hearing.4) Cohen lied in his 1st interview"Starting with his second meeting with the SCO in September 2018, the defendant has accepted responsibility..."It is suggested that Cohen lied to the Special Counsel in their initial meeting set up at Cohen's request, after he had already agreed to co-operate.Mark Osler, a former federal prosecutor who teaches at University of St. Thomas Law school, said this may explain why Cohen didn't get the same generous sentencing recommendation offered to former Trump national security adviser Michael Flynn, another co-operating witness. Mueller's team has requested no jail time for Flynn.Michael Cohen, former personal lawyer to President Donald Trump, leaves his New York apartment building on Friday. Prosecutors Friday asked a judge to sentence Cohen to a 'substantial term of imprisonment' for paying an adult film star hush money on Trump's behalf and evading taxes. (Richard Drew/Associated Press)But Mueller's team has only asked for "due consideration" to Cohen for his change of heart and efforts to correct his lies. They have also asked for him to serve a sentence that is concurrent with a separate case against him for campaign finance violations. The Southern District of New York is prosecuting that case.Legal scholars, referring to sentencing guidelines, believe that means modest leniency on a three-and-a-half-year sentence.5)  Mueller is indicating he has corroboration"The information provided by Cohen about the Moscow Project in these proffer sessions is consistent with and corroborated by other information obtained in the course of the SCO's investigation."There are at least two points in the filing that show Cohen's testimony on the Trump Tower Moscow project has been corroborated by other sources. The memo states: "The information [Cohen] has provided has been credible and consistent with other evidence obtained in the SCO's ongoing investigation."Osler said this means Mueller "has multiple other witnesses independently telling the same story."Mueller recommends no jail time for former national security adviser Michael FlynnAS IT HAPPENS l Flynn memo reveals hints amid mysteries6) Trump's family members could be in hot water"Cohen provided the SCO with useful information concerning certain discrete Russia-related matters core to its investigations that he obtained by virtue of his regular contact with Company executives during the campaign."What's "core" to Mueller's investigation is Russian meddling with the U.S. election. The reference to the "Company" is understood to mean the Trump Organization."It sounds like Cohen provided information related to election interference, and people at the Trump Organization were telling him things about election interference," McQuade said.  Company executives could include family members such as Trump's sons Donald Trump Jr. and Eric, or his daughter, Ivanka. Donald Trump Jr. and the president's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, both attended a Trump Tower meeting in New York in June 2016, where a Kremlin-linked lawyer offered dirt on Trump's presidential rival Hillary Clinton.Trump didn't comment on the Mueller probe while speaking to reporters on the South Lawn of the White House on Friday, saving his invective about the investigation for social media. (Evan Vucci/Associated Press)SDNY prosecutors allege Trump's involvement in a felonyA separate sentencing memo on Friday filed by the Southern District of New York states for the first time that federal prosecutors have reason to believe that Cohen "acted in coordination with and at the direction of" Trump.The case centres on Cohen's guilty plea for violating campaign finance laws by arranging hush money to pay off two women alleging affairs with Trump.Prosecutors from the Southern District are effectively stating that they have reason to believe through corroboration that Cohen's account is truthful. If that's the case, this means the government is saying it has evidence Trump may have committed a crime.	0
20	Michael Cohen, the long-time consigliere and personal lawyer to Donald Trump, once received an email from a friend since boyhood, Felix Sater, who had become a criminal with gangland connections before becoming a federal informer: “Can you believe that two guys from Brooklyn are going to elect a President?”Sater had chaperoned Donald Junior and Ivanka to Moscow at Trump’s request. Vladimir Putin, Sater declared, would back a project to build a Trump Tower in Moscow. But this would be just the beginning of a very fruitful relationship: “Our boy can become President of the USA and we can engineer it ... I will get Putin on this programme and we will get Trump elected.”All this may smack of braggadocio from Sater, born Felix Sheferovsky in Russia. But he was not without influence: he claimed he got Ivanka to sit and be photographed on Putin’s chair in the Kremlin, something she has not denied.He is now once again helping Federal authorities and Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating whether Trump was the Muscovian candidate for the White House, had arrested and “turned” Cohen.Cohen may not have “engineered” the election of “Our boy” to the presidency, but this week the man who is said to know where the Trump skeletons are rattling away is giving testimony which has the potential to gravely damage the chances of the president staying in the White House.Cohen will provide evidence of Trump’s “lies, racism, cheating and conning”, details of his personal finances, including how he allegedly manipulated his income to avoid property tax and, crucially, will supposedly accuse the president of criminal conduct while in office. And he will talk about “Russiagate”, including the Trump Tower deal Sater was involved in.The alleged criminal conduct is related to hush-money payments made by Cohen on behalf of the president to Stormy Daniels, the adult movie actor who says that she had an affair with Trump a decade ago.An example of the racism, it is claimed, are remarks Trump reportedly made about the intelligence of black people and the type of lives, in his eyes, that they live.Cohen’s prepared testimony to the committees, which was initially leaked to The New York Times, will say “In conversations we had during the campaign, at the same time I was actively negotiating in Russia for him, he would look me in the eye and tell me there’s no business in Russia and then go out and lie to the American people by saying the same thing. In his way, he was telling me to lie. Mr Trump did not directly tell me to lie to Congress. That’s not how he operates.“I am ashamed of my weakness and misplaced loyalty – of the things I did for Mr Trump in an effort to protect and promote him,” he will tell the House of Representatives’ oversight and reform committee.“I am ashamed that I chose to take part in concealing Mr Trump’s illicit acts rather than listening to my own conscience.”He will also make hugely significant claims about the Russia investigation, saying that Trump was aware that Democratic Party emails, damaging to Hillary Clinton, had been hacked and would be leaked. Some of the allegations concern Julian Assange, the WikiLeaks founder living at the Ecuadorean embassy in London, and Roger Stone, the president’s friend and adviser who has now been arrested.Cohen is due to say: “In July 2016, days before the Democratic convention, I was in Mr Trump’s office when his secretary announced that Roger Stone was on the phone. Mr Trump put Mr Stone on the speakerphone.“Mr Stone told Mr Trump that he had just gotten off the phone with Julian Assange and that Mr Assange told Mr Stone that, within a couple of days, there would be a massive dump of emails that would damage Hillary Clinton’s campaign. Mr Trump responded by stating to the effect of ‘wouldn’t that be great.’”Cohen, who will begin a three-year sentence on 6 May after pleading guilty to tax crimes, campaign finance violations and lying to Congress, will appear before three Congressional Committees on three consecutive days this week, one in public and two private sessions.There will be intense focus on his public testimony before the House Oversight Committee on Wednesday, the same day that Trump will be meeting Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader, in Vietnam for their second summit. White House officials told CNN that Trump will be watching the proceedings on television during his overnight stay in Hanoi.Cohen, according to his testimony, will say about Trump’s business practices that: “Mr Trump is a cheat. It was my experience that Mr Trump inflated his total assets when it served his purposes, such as trying to be listed among the wealthiest people in Forbes, and deflated his assets to reduce his real estate taxes.“Mr Trump directed me to find a straw bidder to purchase a portrait of him that was being auctioned at an Art Hamptons Event. The objective was to ensure that his portrait, which was going to be auctioned last, would go for the highest price of any portrait that afternoon.The portrait was purchased by the fake bidder for $60,000. Mr Trump directed the Trump Foundation, which is supposed to be a charitable organisation, to repay the fake bidder, despite keeping the art for himself.“And it should come as no surprise that one of my more common responsibilities was that Mr Trump directed me to call business owners, many of whom were small businesses, that were owed money for their services and told them no payment or a reduced payment would be coming. When I advised Mr Trump of my success, he actually revelled in it.”The House Oversight Committee’s chairman, Elijah Cummings, a Maryland Democrat, has already stated that Trump’s former lawyer will speak about Trump’s finances, conflicts of interests at the Trump Foundation and the Trump International Hotel. He has also agreed to discuss the “President’s debts and payments relating to efforts to influence the 2016 election”.Cummings is certainly looking forward to Cohen’s testimony. “This is one moment in history, and when you get to my age and you look back and you realise these moments are very, very significant. It may well be a turning point in our country’s history..., ” he reflected.“He is the only person that I know who has accused this president of a crime. And I think it’s only fair to the president and to Michael Cohen and to the public that he comes forward so that they’ll have an opportunity to observe his demeanour. Republicans will be able to ask him questions, just like a cross-examination, and they can make their own judgment.”On Trump’s alleged racism, Cohen is due to say: “The country has seen Mr Trump court white supremacists and bigots. You have heard him call poorer countries “shitholes”. In private, he is even worse. He once asked me if I could name a country run by a black person that wasn’t a “shithole”. This was when Barack Obama was president of the United States.“While we were once driving through a struggling neighbourhood in Chicago, he commented that only black people could live that way. And, he told me that black people would never vote for him because they were too stupid.”The Oversight Committee will, supposedly, not stray too much into the Russia inquiry – questions centring on that will come during the closed Senate and House Intelligence Committee hearings. These will look into, among other things, the Trump Tower Moscow project and a meeting in Trump Tower, New York, between a group of Russians, Donald Junior, Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner and Trump’s campaign manager, Paul Manafort, who is now in prison.Cohen is due to say on the Moscow Tower project: “I lied to Congress about when Mr Trump stopped negotiating the Moscow Tower project in Russia. I stated that we stopped negotiating in January 2016. That was false – our negotiations continued for months later during the campaign. Mr Trump did not directly tell me to lie to Congress. That’s not how he operates.“In conversations we had during the campaign, at the same time I was actively negotiating in Russia for him, he would look me in the eye and tell me there’s no business in Russia and then go out and lie to the American people by saying the same thing. In his way, he was telling me to lie. You need to know that Mr Trump’s personal lawyers reviewed and edited my statement to Congress about the timing of the Moscow Tower negotiations before I gave it.“To be clear: Mr Trump knew of and directed the Trump Moscow negotiations throughout the campaign and lied about it. He lied about it because he never expected to win the election. He also lied about it because he stood to make hundreds of millions of dollars on the Moscow real estate project.”Watch moreCohen returns to Capitol Hill around 18 months after he appeared for the first time before the Senate Intelligence Committee as part of the Russia investigation when he lied about how long discussions about the Trump Tower project had extended into the 2016 campaign. At the time, Mr Trump was praising his lawyer. But then Cohen started co-operating with Mueller and the president accused him of “becoming a rat”.In the run-up to the testimony, the Trump team has kept up a barrage of insults. White House press secretary Sarah Sanders called the president’s former lawyer a “disgraced felon” and declared that it was “pathetic to see him given yet another opportunity to spread his lies”, and just “ laughable that anyone would take a convicted liar like Cohen at his word.”Cohen is due to say: “I knew early on in my work for Mr Trump that he would direct me to lie to further his business interests. I am ashamed to say, that when it was for a real estate mogul in the private sector, I considered it trivial.“As the president, I consider it significant and dangerous. But in the mix, lying for Mr Trump was normalised, and no one around him questioned it. In fairness, no one around him today questions it, either.”The beginning of the Trump Presidency saw a high number of former military commanders in the administration. But the president appeared to later fall out with the intelligence services and armed forces and regularly traduced senior officers.Cohen is due to speak about how Trump dodged the Vietnam draft. He is due to say: “Mr Trump tasked me to handle the negative press surrounding his medical deferment from the Vietnam draft. Mr Trump claimed it was because of a bone spur, but when I asked for medical records, he gave me none and said there was no surgery. He told me not to answer the specific questions by reporters but rather offer simply the fact that he received a medical deferment. He finished the conversation with the following comment. “You think I’m stupid, I wasn’t going to Vietnam.”Democrats hold that a lot of truth about the president will come out in what Cohen has to say. Adam Schiff, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said Cohen would be questioned about Kremlin links: “Did they go beyond what he told us about Moscow Trump Tower into other areas as well? Who would have been aware of the false testimony that he was giving? What other light can be shed now that he’s cooperating on issues of obstruction of justice or collusion? What more could be tell us about the Trump Tower New York meeting or any other issues relevant to our investigation. We think he has a lot to offer.”	0
21	Well, it is now apparent Donald J. Trump is a Communist lover. He is going to destroy the United States of America and turn the country over to Russia. He does not believe in the U.S. Intelligence Agencies’ reports on the Russians, but he listens to the Russians. It is high time to get Trump impeached and remove Mike Pence for lying to Congress.	0

23	President Trump’s former attorney and fixer Michael Cohen finished up his testimony before the House Oversight Committee with a warning that if Trump loses in 2020, “there will never be a peaceful transition of power.”He also chose to use his closing remarks to criticize the president on everything from immigration, family separation, the government shutdown, to his attacks on the media. “I pray the country doesn’t make the same mistakes that I have made or pay the heavy price that my family and I are paying,” he said.Shortly before the hearing wrapped up, Representative Mark Meadows, a Republican, reacted with outrage when Representative Rashida Tlaib, a Democrat, criticized his decision to bring in a black woman as a prop to disprove racism as racist. “My nieces and nephews are people of color,” he exclaimed, but despite this, he still was a staunch proponent of the racist conspiracy theories surrounding Obama’s birthplace.It’s been a hot second since Virginia has made its way onto this live blog, but the Washington Post is reporting today that first lady Pam Northam handed raw cotton to two African American schoolchildren during a tour of the historic governor’s residence and “asked them to imagine being enslaved and having to pick the crop.”The incident came to light when one of the children’s mother, a state employee, complained. It comes not even a full month after Governor Ralph Northam ignited the whole Virginia firestorm after a college yearbook photo of a man in blackface next to a man in a Ku Klux Klan outfit on his personal page emerged, and he admitted to wearing blackface to impersonate Michael Jackson during a dance competition.“The Governor and Mrs. Northam have asked the residents of the Commonwealth to forgive them for their racially insensitive past actions,” Leah Dozier Walker, who oversees the Office of Equity and Community Engagement at the state Education Department, wrote Feb. 25 to lawmakers and the office of Gov. Ralph Northam (D).“But the actions of Mrs. Northam, just last week, do not lead me to believe that this Governor’s office has taken seriously the harm and hurt they have caused African Americans in Virginia or that they are deserving of our forgiveness,” she wrote.The governor’s office told the Washington Post that Pam Northam “simply handed the cotton to whoever was nearby.” “I regret that I have upset anyone,” she said in a statement sent from the governor’s spokeswoman.Cohen’s testimony was briefly interrupted when Republican Mark Meadows reacted with outrage over Representative Rashida Tlaib saying that bringing in a black woman as a prop to disprove racism struck her as racist. “My nieces and nephews are people of color,” he exclaimed.After the hearing, several pointed out that whatever he believes his views on race to be, Meadows was a staunch proponent of the racist conspiracy theories surrounding Obama’s birthplace.Cohen’s testimony could lead to the release of Trump’s tax returns.Trump’s reasoning for not releasing his tax filings during the 2016 campaign was that he is being audited, but Cohen said he presumes that Trump is not. He said that Trump did not want to release his tax returns because he “didn’t want an entire group of think tanks, who are tax experts, to run through his returns.”Journalism has played a vital role in exposing lies and revealing the truth during the Trump presidency, but the Guardian needs support from readers like you to continue this important work.A free press, an independent judiciary and empowered citizens are essential to keeping our democracy strong. What makes the Guardian different from so many others in media is our editorial independence, meaning we set our own agenda. Our journalism is free from commercial bias and not influenced by billionaire owners, politicians or shareholders.And unlike many news organisations, we don’t have paywall: we have chosen an approach that allows us to keep our reporting accessible to everyone, regardless of where they live or what they can afford.Every contribution we receive from readers like you, big or small, goes directly into funding our journalism. We hope you’ll consider making a contribution today.In his closing remarks, Cohen admitted, “My loyalty to Mr Trump has cost me everything.”He criticizes the president for a slew of his decisions and comments, on everything from family separations, the government shutdown, to Trump’s attacks on the media:“We honor our veterans, even in the rain. You tell the truth, even when it doesn’t aggrandize you. You respect the law and our incredible law enforcement agents.”“You don‘t attack the media and those who question what you don’t like or what you don’t want them to say. And you take responsibility for your own dirty deeds.”“You don’t separate families from one another, or demonize those looking to America for a better life. You don’t vilify people based the god they pray to, and you don’t cuddle up to our adversaries.”You don’t shut down the government before Christmas and New Year’s, just to appease your base.”Cohen ended his closing remarks by saying, “I pray the country doesn’t make the same mistakes that I have made or pay the heavy price that my family and I are paying.”Committee chairman, Elijah Cummings, is placing the Cohen hearing in the broader context of US politics.“I know it’s painful going to prison,” Cummings said. “And I know it’s painful being called a rat.”Cummings says he lived in the inner city of Baltimore and calling someone a rat “is one of the worst things you can do” because in prison, people who have been called rats are known as snitches.“The president called you a rat,” Cummings said. “We’re better than that, we really are!”Cummings says he doesn’t know if people believe Cohen, but he is showing some compassion, noting Cohen came in with his head down and this must be one of the hardest things he can do. Cummings says he was moved by images of Cohen and his daughter, which makes Cohen visibly emotional.Cummings is fired up.“We have to get back to normal! And with that, this meeting is adjourned.”Cohen: if Trump loses in 2020 'there will never be a peaceful transition of power'Michael Cohen makes closing remarks addressed to Donald Trump.If Trump loses in 2020, “there will never be a peaceful transition of power,” says Cohen.Rashida Tlaib, the Democrat from Michigan, criticizes Republicans for bringing in Lynne Patton, a black HUD employee, to stand at the hearing as a way of disproving allegations that Donald Trump is a racist.Tlaib says as a woman of color, the act of bringing in a black woman as a prop to disprove racism struck her as racist.Mark Meadows, the Republican who invited Patton to the hearing, is extremely emotional after Tlaib’s comment, prompting chairman Elijah Cummings to intervene.“No Mr. Chairman, I did not mean to call Mr. Meadows a racist,” Tlaib saysCummings highlights that he is the son of sharecroppers and is in a good position to discuss racism.Patton is a staunch defender of Trump and longtime friend of Cohen. The Washington Post said she posted on Instagram that she was sad to have been so close to Cohen. “As the daughter of a man born in Birmingham, Alabama, there is no amount of money in the world that would make me work for a man who I thought harbored bigoted or racist ideologies,” she wrote.Ayanna Pressley, a Democrat from Massachusetts, questions Cohen about Trump’s charity, the Trump Foundation.She concludes by asking if a person who makes racist comments and “has a black friend,” can still be a racist?Cohen says “yes.”The black friend Pressley is referring to is most likely Lynne Patton, an official at the US Department of Housing and Urban Development, who was invited by Republican Mark Meadows to stand at the testimony earlier today.Patton told the Washington Post that she happened to be in DC for a HUD meeting when Meadows invited her to attend the hearing.Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Democrat from New York, speeds through earlier lines of questioning.Cohen confirms Trump presented inflated assets. Ocasio-Cortez asks where we can find evidence of this. Cohen says in the Trump Organization.Ocasio-Cortez notes that she drives past a Trump golf course in the Bronx every day on the way from her home to work. She cites Washington Post reporting that suggest Trump has improperly devalued assets to gain tax benefits. “It’s identical what he did at Trump national golf club,” Cohen saysOcasio-Cortez repeatedly asks Cohen who can provide information on Trump’s alleged efforts to avoid paying taxes.Cohen says the person who can clarify these questions is Allen Weisselberg, the Trump Organization’s longtime chief financial officer.Ro Khanna, a Democrat from California, asks about what he calls the “smoking gun” document in Cohen’s testimony – a check signed by Donald Trump Jr to fund illegal hush money payments to pornographic actor, Stormy Daniels.Khanna asks if Trump’s criminal conspiracy involved the president, his eldest son and Allen Weisselberg, the Trumps’ longtime chief financial officer.Cohen responds: “yes.”Khanna asked whether the Southern District of New York (SDNY) is investigating a criminal conspiracy among the four people and Cohen responds he did not want to answer. Cohen has said repeatedly today that there are topics he cannot discuss related to the SDNY investigation.The Guardian’s Jon Swaine wrote about the significance of the check this morning: “the finding that Donald Jr was directly involved in the scheme to pay off Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, could mean the president’s son faces legal jeopardy.”As the investigation into Trump’s administration unfolds…The Guardian will continue to provide insight, analysis and factual reporting to help bring the truth to light.

24	Russian state TV on Sunday listed potential targets in the U.S. in the event of a nuclear strike and claimed that its new hypersonic missile technology could reach them in less than five minutes.Reuters called the report “unusual even by the sometimes bellicose standards of Russian state TV.” The targets included the Pentagon and Camp David. The report came days after Russian President Vladimir Putin warned the U.S. against deploying intermediate-range missiles in Europe.Putin reaffirmed that Russia will not be the first to deploy new intermediate-range missiles in Europe, but warned that it will retaliate if the U.S. puts such missiles on the continent. He said it will not only target the host countries but field new weapons that will target U.S. decision-making centers.The U.S. insisted that it has no plans to deploy missiles in Europe.A Putin spokesman said he did not name any “geographic site Russian missiles” might be aimed at. The spokesman said the government does not interfere with news programs.The Guardian reported that other U.S. sites included Maryland’s Fort Ritchie, McClellan air force base in California and Jim Creek naval communications base in Washington state.	0
25	WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump's former personal lawyer is preparing to tell a House committee Wednesday that Trump knew ahead of time that WikiLeaks had emails damaging to his rival Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign and that he is a "racist," a "conman" and a "cheat."Michael Cohen suggests in prepared testimony obtained by The Associated Press that Trump also implicitly told him to lie about a Moscow real estate project. Cohen has pleaded guilty to lying to Congress about the project, which he says Trump knew about as Cohen was negotiating with Russia during the election.Cohen says Trump did not directly tell him to lie, but that "he would look me in the eye and tell me there's no business in Russia and then go out and lie to the American people by saying the same thing."Cohen said that "in his way, he was telling me to lie."In the testimony, Cohen apologizes for his actions and says "I am ashamed that I chose to take part in concealing Mr. Trump's illicit acts rather than listening to my own conscience."On WikiLeaks, Cohen says he was in Trump's office in July 2016 when his longtime adviser Roger Stone called Trump. He says Trump put Stone on speakerphone and Stone said that "within a couple of days, there would be a massive dump of emails that would damage Hillary Clinton's campaign."Trump responded by saying "wouldn't that be great," according to Cohen."A lot of people have asked me about whether Mr. Trump knew about the release of the hacked Democratic National Committee emails ahead of time," Cohen says in the testimony. "The answer is yes."Cohen also says that Trump made racist comments about African-Americans, saying at one point that black people would never vote for him because they were too stupid. Cohen says that he and Trump once drove through a struggling neighborhood in Chicago and that Trump remarked that only black people could live that way.He also says Trump once asked him to name a country run by a black person that wasn't falling apart, though he says Trump used a vulgarism. At the time Barack Obama was America's president.Looking ahead to his public testimony, Cohen said Tuesday that the American people can decide "exactly who is telling the truth" when he appears Wednesday before the House Oversight and Reform committee, setting the stage for an explosive public hearing that threatens to overshadow Trump's summit in Vietnam with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.Cohen, once Trump's loyal attorney and fixer, has turned on his former boss and cooperated with special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation. He begins a three-year prison sentence in May after he pleaded guilty to lying to Congress in 2017 and committing campaign finance violations while he was working for Trump.He met with the Senate intelligence committee for more than nine hours behind closed doors on Tuesday. Cohen said he appreciated the opportunity to "clear the record and tell the truth" after acknowledging he lied to the committee in 2017.It was the first of three consecutive days of congressional appearances for Cohen. After the public hearing Wednesday, he will appear before the House intelligence panel Thursday, again speaking in private.Republicans are expected to aggressively attempt to discredit Cohen, given that he has acknowledged lying previously. White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said in a statement Tuesday it was "laughable that anyone would take a convicted liar like Cohen at his word, and pathetic to see him given yet another opportunity to spread his lies."One Republican House member did more than just question Cohen's credibility. Florida Republican Matt Gaetz tweeted Tuesday that the world is "about to learn a lot" about Cohen and suggested he knew of disparaging information that could come out during the hearing. The Trump ally offered no evidence to support his remarks and waved off the notion that he appeared to be threatening or intimidating a witness.After a barrage of criticism, Gaetz apologized and said he was deleting the tweet and should have chosen better words to show his intent.Lanny Davis, one of Cohen's lawyers, said in a statement that he wouldn't respond to Gaetz's "despicable lies and personal smears, except to say we trust that his colleagues in the House, both Republicans and Democrats, will repudiate his words and his conduct."Democrats have been alternately suspicious of Cohen and eager to hear what he has to say. Sen. Mark Warner, the intelligence panel's top Democrat, suggested in a brief statement to reporters outside Tuesday's interview that Cohen had provided important information."Two years ago when this investigation started I said it may be the most important thing I am involved in in my public life in the Senate, and nothing I've heard today dissuades me from that view," Warner said.In addition to lying to Congress, Cohen pleaded guilty last year to campaign finance violations for his involvement in payments to two women who allege they had affairs with Trump.Federal prosecutors in New York have said Trump directed Cohen to arrange the payments to buy the silence of porn actress Stormy Daniels and former Playboy model Karen McDougal in the run-up to the 2016 campaign. Cohen told a judge that he agreed to cover up Trump's "dirty deeds" out of "blind loyalty."In his prepared testimony, Cohen says he will present the committee with a copy of the check Trump wrote from his personal bank account after he became president to reimburse him for the hush money payments.Trump has denied the allegations and said Cohen lied to get a lighter sentence.Cohen is not expected to discuss matters related to Russia in the public hearing, saving that information for the closed-door interviews with the intelligence committees. House Oversight and Reform Chairman Elijah Cummings has said he doesn't want to interfere with Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election and links to Trump's campaign.Members of the Oversight panel are expected to ask questions about the campaign finance violations, Trump's business practices and compliance with tax laws and "the accuracy of the president's public statements," according to a memo laying out the scope of the hearing.	0

27	HANOI (Reuters) - North Korean leader Kim Jong Un set off by train for Vietnam on Saturday, for his second summit with U.S. President Donald Trump next week, media reported, and hours later, two witnesses saw a train crossing into China from North Korea.The reports of Kim’s departure from North Korea came after Vietnam announced that Kim would make an official visit in “coming days”, as the Southeast Asian country prepares to host the summit with Trump on Wednesday and Thursday.No details of the leaders’ travel arrangements, or for the summit, have been officially released.Trump and Kim will meet in the Vietnamese capital, Hanoi, eight months after their historic summit in Singapore in June - the first between a sitting U.S. president and a North Korean leader - at which they pledged to work towards the complete denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.But progress has been scant since then.The Trump administration has pressed North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons program, which threatens the United States, before it can expect any concessions.North Korea wants an easing of punishing U.S.-led sanctions, security guarantees and a formal end of the 1950-1953 Korean War, which ended in a truce, not a treaty.Kim left the North Korean capital of Pyongyang at around 5 p.m. (0800 GMT) in an armored train, Russia’s TASS news agency said, citing a North Korean diplomatic source.North Korea’s state media has yet to confirm either Kim’s trip to Vietnam or his summit with Trump.Two witnesses in the Chinese border city of Dandong, where the main rail line from North Korea arrives in China, said a train had crossed the Yalu River into China at around 9.30 p.m. (1330 GMT).South Korea’s Yonhap news agency and broadcaster YTN also reported that a train suspected to be carrying Kim had arrived in Dandong.Chinese security chased away people trying to take photographs, one witness said.It was unclear if Kim was on the train. China has declined to answer questions about Kim’s travel plans via the country.It could take Kim at least two and a half days to travel the thousands of kilometers through China by train to Vietnam.TRAIN SPOTTINGA senior security official in Vietnam told Reuters that Hanoi had been expecting a Vietnam-bound train to depart Pyongyang on Saturday, but did not know if Kim Jong Un himself was on board.Two sources with direct knowledge of security and logistics planning told Reuters on Wednesday that Vietnam was preparing for Kim to arrive by train.His train was expected to stop at the Vietnamese border station of Dong Dang, where he will disembark and drive 170 km (105 miles) to Hanoi by car, the sources told Reuters.Vietnamese police have stepped up security around the border station.On Feb. 26, Vietnam will ban traffic on the road Kim is expected to take to Hanoi from a station on the Chinese border, state media said.Travel by train has been a favorite mode of transport for Kim Jong Un, and his father, Kim Jong Il, and grandfather, Kim Il Sung.In 1958, Kim Il Sung went from Pyongyang to Beijing by train, then flew from Beijing to Hanoi in a plane provided by China, South Korea’s Yonhap News Agency reported on Saturday citing archived Chinese media reports.QUESTIONSThe summit in Hanoi comes amid some questions about prospects for progress.American intelligence officials have said they believe Kim is unlikely to ever relinquish all of his nuclear arsenal, and U.N. monitors have reported that in recent months North Korea had taken steps to hide, disperse and protect its weapons.But a former U.S. intelligence officer, who helped arrange the first summit, predicted on Friday the second summit would be more productive than the first, quoting Kim Jong Un as saying last year he did not want his children to live with the burden of nuclear weapons.Kim is visiting Vietnam at the invitation of President Nguyen Phu Trong, who is also general secretary of the ruling Communist Party, Vietnam’s foreign ministry said in a statement earlier on Saturday, but it gave no further details.The preferred location for the summit is the Government Guesthouse, a colonial-era building in central Hanoi, three sources told Reuters on Wednesday.	0

29	By Youri KempCaribbean News Now associate editoryouri@caribbeannewsnow.comNEW YORK, USA — The Trump administration, Venezuela’s President Nicholas Maduro’s main detractor, last week presented a draft resolution at the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) calling for international aid deliveries to increase unabated and for new presidential elections to be held in Venezuela.The US has been vocal about its support for the Venezuelan National Assembly president, Juan Guaido, who announced himself as interim president earlier this year, which has caused Maduro’s supporters and allies to claim interference from the USA and have gone as far as to warn against a US military invasion and further US unilateral action against the Maduro regime, a regime that Washington claims to be illegitimate.The US draft resolution, along with strong language expressing support for the Venezuelan National Assembly, which the US claims is the only democratically elected institution in Venezuela, also expresses the US’s deep concern over the brutality of the Venezuelan armed forces on peaceful protestors and also “stresses the need to prevent a further deterioration of the humanitarian situation in Venezuela and to facilitate access and delivery of assistance to all in need in the entirety of the territory of Venezuela.”The US has reportedly sent humanitarian aid through Colombia via the border city of Cucuta to head into Venezuela, but Maduro reportedly has blocked the shipments from entering into Venezuela.The US also directly called for the “immediate start of a political process leading to free and fair presidential elections, with international electoral observation, in line with Venezuela’s constitution; and for UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres to “utilize his good offices” to ensure that elections do happen in a free and fair manner in Venezuela.The US Draft Resolution was anticipated to be met with a counter-proposal by one of Maduro’s main allies, the Russian Federation, a veto-wielding member of the UNSC already delivering its counter-proposal to the UNSC on Friday of last week.The Russian Draft Resolution states that they have concerns over the threats to use force against the territorial integrity and political independence of Venezuela; and that Russia’s aim is to see a peaceful resolution of the stalemate in Venezuela, and that Russia “supports all initiatives aimed at reaching a political solution amongst Venezuelans to the current situation … through a genuine and inclusive process of national dialogue.”This raises an interesting scenario about what may be possible with regard to support for tough measures against Maduro and those who favour more leniency or non-intervention.The Russian Federation is a permanent member of the UNSC and has veto-power over any resolution brought forward in that body. As it stands now, some diplomats think it will be near impossible for Russia to secure the 9 votes out of 15 total at the UNSC to ensure that their resolution passes without another veto-power member of the core five UNSC Permanent Members blocking it, with the other permanent members of the UNSC being the United States, the United Kingdom and France who have all pledged support for Juan Guaido and the other being another Maduro ally, China.Russia has also promised to block any council resolutions to suspend Venezuela from the United Nations.The Russian Federation, along with China and to a lesser degree Cuba, have driven their stakes in the ground for the Maduro regime and have sent support in various ways to the Maduro regime.Some security analysts estimate that, if support from Russia, China and Cuba were to be choked off or disappear, the Maduro regime will be neutered and will dissolve.According to the Council on Foreign Relations Russia has been one of Venezuela’s closest allies since 2006, when President Hugo Chavez, a socialist strongman and fierce critic of the United States, signed a $2.9 billion arms deal in exchange for Russian fighter aircraft. The relationship allowed Russia access to Venezuelan oil assets at below-market prices.Russia is Venezuela’s largest supplier of weapons, having sold the country more than $10 billion in hardware since the mid-2000s, including assault rifles, jet fighters, tanks, and missile systems. The two nations also conduct joint military exercises, and Russian jets and warships make regular stopovers. In a recent show of force, two Russian bombers capable of carrying nuclear weapons visited Venezuela.Russia also has been a lender of last resort. In late 2017, Moscow bailed Venezuela out by restructuring more than $3 billion in sovereign debt, which allowed the Maduro government to meet its obligations to other creditors. Meanwhile, Russia’s state-backed oil giant, Rosneft, is one of Venezuela’s largest foreign backers, loaning it roughly $2.5 billion in recent years in exchange for future energy shipments. Rosneft also co-owns several oil and gas projects with PDVSA, Venezuela’s state energy company — which was just sanctioned by the United States — and it has a 49 percent stake in Citgo, PDVSA’s US refining arm.China on the other hand has been Venezuela’s other major financial crutch. It views the socialist regime in Venezuela as a geopolitical ally and an important trading partner. Over the past decade, Beijing has lent Caracas some $70 billion, mostly for development projects, in exchange for future oil shipments. Analysts estimate the Maduro regime owes China about $13 billion. China is behind only the United States and India as an importer of Venezuelan crude. However, President Xi Jinping has thus far refused to restructure Venezuela’s outstanding loans, and some experts suggest China could shift its support to Guaido if he were to guarantee full repayment of Chinese loans.While support for the Maduro regime has been steady over the last several years, some suggest that this may be shifting, as China has also reached out to opposition forces in Venezuela, including directly to Guaido. While this may signal China is looking beyond a Maduro-run Venezuela and may support his ouster, but China’s political approach to the Latin American and Caribbean region has always been to support both sides of the political divide under their “Party to Party” consultative process.Cuba has been Venezuela’s main political supporter in Latin America, and it reportedly supplies the Maduro regime with large numbers of security and military advisors to spy on the military ranks, as well as to provide other intelligence.Cuba has been providing Venezuela with hundreds of doctors, nurses, teachers, engineers, and other professionals since 2000, when Chavez agreed to supply Cuba with discounted oil. In 2017, there were as many as 15,000 Cubans living in Venezuela. But as Cuba begins to open up and attempt to adopt more market-liberalization policies in addition to allowing more trade, travel and dialogue between it and the USA and, with the Castro brothers being off the political scene in Cuba, it is unsure how long Cuba will keep this support ongoing as a matter of practicality for the island nation.	0
30	Russians are using materials obtained from special counsel Robert Mueller's office in a disinformation campaign apparently aimed at discrediting the investigation into Moscow's election interference, federal prosecutors said on Wednesday.One or more people associated with the special counsel's case against Russian hackers made statements last October claiming to have stolen discovery materials that were originally provided by Mueller to Concord Management, Mueller's team said in court documents filed on Wednesday in the Russian troll farm case.That discovery — evidence and documents traded between both sides of a lawsuit — appears to have been altered and disseminated as part of a disinformation campaign apparently aimed at discrediting the ongoing investigations in Russian interference in the U.S. political system, according to the documents.Concord Management, a company owned by a Russian oligarch known as President Vladimir Putin's "chef," is one of three Russian entities that were accused by the special counsel last February of helping to mastermind the social media meddling into the 2016 election. Thirteen Russian citizens were also indicted and accused of taking part in the widespread effort.According to the documents filed Wednesday, a Twitter account called @HackingRedstone tweeted: "We’ve got access to the Special Counsel Mueller’s probe database as we hacked Russian server with info from the Russian troll case Concord LLC v. Mueller. You can view all the files Mueller had about the IRA and Russian collusion. Enjoy the reading!"The account has since been suspended.Prosecutors said that a link attached to the tweet "contained file folders with names and folder structures that are unique to the names and structures of materials (including tracking numbers assigned by the Special Counsel’s Office) produced by the government in discovery."Prosecutors added, "The fact that the webpage contained numerous irrelevant files suggest that the person who created the webpage used their knowledge of the nonsensitive discovery to make it appear as though the irrelevant files contained on the webpage were the sum total evidence of 'IRA and Russian collusion' gathered by law enforcement in this matter in an apparent effort to discredit the investigation."The Internet Research Agency, or IRA, is a St. Petersburg-based firm whose key executives have also been indicted by Mueller on charges of defrauding the United States.The special counsel's office said the account used to publish the discovery materials was registered by a user with an IP address in Russia.The filing states that the FBI has found no evidence that U.S. government servers, including servers used by the special counsel's office, had been breached. Rather, the information appears to have come from the materials shared with attorneys for Concord Management.According to prosecutors, attorneys for Concord Management said that they received calls from reporters about the information, but they had not been hacked. Instead, Mueller's team notes, the defense told them it appears to have come from a 2014 hack that was disseminated online — a hypothesis that was not consistent with the facts, federal prosecutors said.On Thursday, Mueller's team updated their filing with precise dates for the actions taken on Twitter, noting that the account @HackingRedstone started sending direct messages to members of the media on October 22, before making a public tweet on October 30 in regards to the supposed discovery documents.	0
31	President Donald Trump’s administration has neglected for nearly three months to implement required sanctions targeting Russia that were intended to punish Moscow for the poisoning of former Russian spy Sergei Skripal in the United Kingdom last year.The State Department told NBC News it would “proceed” with the “statutory requirements,” but it did not specify when it would implement the sanctions. "There is no deadline in the law for imposing sanctions," the State Department said.A previous round of sanctions related to the Skripal poisoning were implemented against Russia last August, according to NBC. But that was only after the Trump administration was encouraged by Republican lawmakers to recognize that Moscow had violated the Chemical and Biological Weapons Control and Warfare Elimination Act.President Donald Trump and Russia’s President Vladimir Putin attend a joint press conference after a meeting at the Presidential Palace in Helsinki, on July 16, 2018. Trump’s administration has neglected for nearly three months to implement required sanctions targeting Russia for the poisoning of former Russian spy Sergei Skripal. BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI/AFP/Getty ImagesWhen those sanctions were implemented, it gave Moscow a three-month time frame to prove it had come into compliance with the law. In November, the administration told lawmakers that Russia remained in violation, saying it would “proceed” with additional sanctions. But despite encouragement from GOP politicians, Trump has yet to move forward with the required punitive measures.Meanwhile, the Trump administration’s effort to remove sanctions targeting Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska, who was allegedly linked to Moscow’s election interference campaign, has come under scrutiny. Republicans in Congress supported the proposal by Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, but a report this week from The New York Times alleged lawmakers had been misled about the terms of sanctions relief.According to a confidential document signed by U.S. representatives and Deripaska, the oligarch was relieved from hundreds of millions of dollars in debt and his family and associates were allowed to maintain control of his most important company. Mnuchin falsely told lawmakers the deal would “significantly diminish Deripaska’s ownership and sever his control” to justify the sanctions relief.Republican Senator Mike Rounds from South Dakota told CNN on Thursday that lawmakers would “take another look at” the sanctions relief following the revelation from the Times. On Wednesday, the network’s senior political analyst John Avlon, citing the story, alleged that “the Treasury Department seems to be doing its damnedest to help a Russian oligarch by relieving sanctions, hiding the evidence and duping the Senate in the process.”Trump has repeatedly insisted that he has been exceptionally tough on Russia as president. "If you ask the folks in Russia, I've been tougher on Russia than anybody else," Trump told Fox News earlier in January. "Nobody's been as tough as I have, from any standpoint."Although Trump has implemented new sanctions targeting Russia since taking office, his 2016 presidential campaign remains under investigation by special counsel Robert Mueller for alleged “collusion” with Moscow. The probe has resulted in indictments or guilty plea from five of Trump’s former advisers, 26 Russian nationals and three Russian companies, among others.The president’s former campaign chairman Paul Manafort, who has been convicted in the investigation, also allegedly lied to the FBI about sharing confidential polling data with an associate linked to Russian intelligence during the campaign.	0
32	A second summit between President Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un will take place next month, the White House announced Friday.President Trump met with a top North Korean official Friday afternoon in the Oval Office.“President Donald J. Trump met with Kim Yong Chol for an hour and a half, to discuss denuclearization and a second summit, which will take place near the end of February. The President looks forward to meeting with Chairman Kim at a place to be announced at a later date," the White House said in a statement.The face-to-face came after Secretary of State Mike Pompeo met with Kim Yong-chol, North Korea's lead negotiator, in the nation’s capital early Friday morning to negotiate terms that could lead to a second nuclear summit between Trump and Pyongyang leader Kim Jong-un.Pompeo and Kim Yong-chol didn’t shake hands or respond to reporters’ questions but did smile during a photo opportunity ahead of their meeting at a hotel in Northwest Washington.Kim Yong-chol was understood to have carried a letter from the North Korean dictator to Trump. Last year, he presented Trump with an oversized letter in the Oval Office that led to the leaders’ historic June summit.“They will discuss relations between the two countries and continued progress on North Korea’s final, fully verified denuclearization," White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said in a statement shortly before the meeting.Trump has spoken several times of having a second summit with Kim early this year and has exchanged multiple letters with the North Korean leader despite little tangible progress on a vague denuclearization agreement reached at their first meeting in Singapore last June. Since then, several private analysts have published reports detailing continuing North Korean development of nuclear and missile technology.At a conference of U.S. diplomats at the State Department on Wednesday, Vice President Mike Pence acknowledged the lack of progress. He called the Trump-Kim dialogue "promising" but stressed that "we still await concrete steps by North Korea to dismantle the nuclear weapons that threaten our people and our allies in the region."A planned meeting between Pompeo and Kim Yong-chol in New York last November was called off abruptly. U.S. officials said at the time that North Korea had canceled the session.The talks have stalled over North Korea's refusal to provide a detailed accounting of its nuclear and missile facilities that would be used by inspectors to verify any deal to dismantle them.The North has demanded that the U.S. end harsh economic penalties and provide security guarantees before the North takes any steps beyond its initial suspension of nuclear and missile tests.Trump has offered assurances that a second summit would allow the two leaders to seal a deal resolving the nuclear standoff and improving a relationship marked by decades of animosity and mistrust since the Korean War.Kim Jong-un expressed frustration in an annual New Year's address over the lack of progress in negotiations. But on a visit to Beijing last week, he said North Korea would pursue a second summit "to achieve results that will be welcomed by the international community," according to China's official Xinhua News Agency.Kim's latest trip to China, his fourth since last year, came as the North's strongest ally has encouraged negotiations with the U.S. while at the same time arguing in favor of immediate easing of sanctions.The U.S. and North Korea seemed close to war at points during 2017. The North staged a series of weapons tests that brought it closer to its nuclear goal of one day being able to target anywhere on the U.S. mainland. The two sides then took turns insulting each other: Trump called Kim "Little Rocket Man" and North Korea said Trump was a "dotard."Kim abruptly turned to diplomacy with Seoul and Washington last year, possibly fearing economic harm from the penalties imposed over the weapons tests.Still, even after the Singapore summit, the first between U.S. and North Korean leaders, there has been little real progress in nuclear disarmament.Independent analysts are highly skeptical that North Korea will easily abandon a nuclear arsenal constructed in the face of deep poverty and probably seen by Kim as his only guarantee of his government's survival.Separately, a North Korean diplomat arrived in Sweden on Friday for an unscheduled visit leading some to speculate it might be the spot for a second summit.Swedish Foreign Ministry spokesman Vilhelm Rundquist said Deputy Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui has landed in Sweden “to take part in talks in a minor format where international experts take part.”He declined to give further details. Sweden’s TT news agency said Swedish Foreign Minister Margot Wallstrom would also attend the event.It is possible that U.S. special envoy for North Korea Stephen Biegun would join the meeting later, The Associated Press, citing an anonymous source, reported.Fox News' Gregg Re and The Associated Press contrbuted to this report.  	0
33	A Belarusian escort who claimed to have audio recordings that could link Russia with President Trump’s election was detained in Moscow on Thursday, according to Russian news agencies.The escort, Anastasia Vashukevich, was deported from Thailand on Thursday after she and seven other defendants — five Russians and two Belarusians — pleaded guilty to charges of solicitation and conspiracy. Russian news services said that she had been detained when she arrived at Sheremetyevo Airport in Moscow.Citing a statement from the Interior Ministry, the Russian news services Interfax and RIA Novosti said that three Russian citizens and a female Belarusian citizen, “arriving on a flight from the Kingdom of Thailand,” were arrested at the airport on charges of inducement to prostitution.If convicted, the four face up to six years in prison apiece.Ms. Vashukevich, who also goes by the name Nastya Rybka, was detained in Moscow with her associate Alexander Kirillov, who had helped her conduct a sex-training seminar in the Thai city of Pattaya.Mr. Kirillov’s wife, Kristina, told reporters at the Moscow airport that Ms. Vashukevich was supposed to have flown on to Minsk, Belarus, Interfax reported.The pair were arrested by the Thai authorities last February after coming under suspicion of working without a permit or visa, and before long Ms. Vashukevich asked for asylum in the United States. She said she could provide more than 16 hours of audio recordings that could shed light on Russian interference in the 2016 American presidential election.By this point, Ms. Vashukevich had already gained a degree of online fame.Her Instagram videos of Sergei E. Prikhodko, then a deputy prime minister, and Oleg Deripaska, a billionaire with ties to the Kremlin, were featured prominently in a 25-minute video published by Aleksei A.

34	President Donald Trump’s former attorney John Dowd told Fox News’ Brian Kilmeade that he believes the president is facing a ‘coup’ and the recent reports regarding the president’s relationship with Russia prove that.Appearing Monday on Fox News Radio’s “Brian Kilmeade Show,” Dowd accused special counsel Robert Mueller, former FBI Director James Comey, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, and former Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe of conspiring against the president.“Little did I know that it appears that they were all in it together,” Dowd said. “I mean Rosenstein, Comey, Mueller, McCabe, the whole crowd and they were out to get this president no matter what. I don't think they sincerely believed anything about Russia.”“This is our worst nightmare that someone with that kind of power would then decide to go after the President. I mean it's a coup,” Dowd said. “That's what it is an attempted coup by Comey and his crowd. And the evidence is all over there. I take the New York Times article as an admission of their bad behavior.”The New York Times reported Friday that the FBI opened an investigation to determine if President Trump was working for Russia.The president refuted the report on Fox News’ “Justice With Judge Jeanine” Saturday night, although critics pointed out he did not directly say that he did not work for Russia.“I never worked for Russia,” the president told reporters this morning at the White House calling the investigation a ‘hoax.’“The people that started that investigation are [Andrew] McCabe who is a proven liar and was fired from the FBI,” Trump said.He then named attorney Lisa Page and former FBI agent Peter Strzok and cited their text messages as further proof.	0
35	(CNN)In the chaotic aftermath at the FBI following Director James Comey's firing, a half-dozen senior FBI officials huddled to set in motion the momentous move to open an investigation into President Donald Trump that included trying to understand why he was acting in ways that seemed to benefit Russia.They debated a range of possibilities, according to portions of transcripts of two FBI officials' closed-door congressional interviews obtained by CNN. On one end was the idea that Trump fired Comey at the behest of Russia. On the other was the possibility that Trump didn't have an improper relationship with the Kremlin and was acting within the bounds of his executive authority, the transcripts show.James Baker, then-FBI general counsel, said the FBI officials were contemplating with regard to Russia whether Trump was "acting at the behest of and somehow following directions, somehow executing their will.""That was one extreme. The other extreme is that the President is completely innocent, and we discussed that too," Baker told House investigators last year. "There's a range of things this could possibly be. We need to investigate, because we don't know whether, you know, the worst-case scenario is possibly true or the President is totally innocent and we need to get this thing over with — and so he can move forward with his agenda."Following Comey's firing, the FBI opened a probe into Trump for possible obstruction of justice, as CNN has previously reported. Part of the impetus for the investigation, the New York Times first reported Friday, was whether Trump's actions seemed to benefit Russia.The congressional transcripts obtained by CNN reveal new details into how the FBI launched the investigation into Trump and the discussions that were going on inside the bureau during a tumultuous and pivotal period ahead of the internal investigation and special counsel Robert Mueller's appointment.Republicans view the officials' comments as evidence that top officials at the FBI were planning all along to investigate Trump and that the probe wasn't sparked by the Comey firing, according to a Republican source with knowledge of the interviews.While the FBI launched its investigation in the days after Comey's abrupt dismissal, the bureau had previously contemplated such a step, according to testimony from former FBI lawyer Lisa Page.Peter Strzok, the former FBI agent who was dismissed from Mueller's team and later fired over anti-Trump text messages, texted Page in the hours after Comey's firing and said: "We need to open the case we've been waiting on now while Andy is acting," a reference to then-acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe.Page was pressed on the meaning of the message in her interview with congressional investigators, and she confirmed that the text was related to the Russia investigation into potential collusion.Page told lawmakers the decision to open the case was not about "who was occupying the director's chair," according to a source. While FBI lawyers limited her answers about the text, she said the text wasn't suggesting that the case couldn't be opened with Comey as director."It's not that it could not have been done," Page told lawmakers. "This case had been a topic of discussion for some time. The 'waiting on' was an indecision and a cautiousness on the part of the bureau with respect to what to do and whether there was sufficient predication to open."Portions of Page's interview were first reported by The Epoch Times.This weekend, Trump in a series of tweets attacked the FBI and Comey, calling him a "crooked cop.""Wow, just learned in the Failing New York Times that the corrupt former leaders of the FBI, almost all fired or forced to leave the agency for some very bad reasons, opened up an investigation on me, for no reason & with no proof, after I fired Lyin' James Comey, a total sleaze!" Trump tweeted.In his congressional testimony, Baker said that he did not discuss with Comey the possibility that Russia had influenced his firing. But Baker met with a group of roughly a half-dozen officials, including McCabe and possibly Strzok and Page, to discuss it."Not only would it be an issue of obstructing an investigation, but the obstruction itself would hurt our ability to figure out what the Russians had done, and that is what would be the threat to national security," Baker told lawmakers, according to an excerpt from the transcript first reported by the Times and confirmed by CNN.Baker said the notion that Trump was acting at the behest of Russia was "discussed as a theoretical possibility.""I'm speaking theoretically. If the President of the United States fired Jim Comey at the behest of the Russian government, that would be unlawful and unconstitutional," Baker said."Is that what happened here?" Rep. John Ratcliffe, a Texas Republican, asked Baker."I don't know," Baker responded, before the FBI lawyer cut off additional questions on that line of inquiry.Representatives for Baker, Page, Strzok and McCabe declined to comment.Comey's firing wasn't the only development that prompted the investigation into Trump, according to the Times, as Trump subsequently tied Comey's firing to the Russia investigation on two separate occasions before the investigation was launched, including in an NBC News interview two days after Comey's dismissal.Republicans asked in their interviews with FBI officials questions about the fact that both Comey and McCabe kept memos detailing their conversations with Trump, a step they didn't take with President Barack Obama. Comey's memos, in which he wrote that Trump suggested Comey drop the probe into former national security adviser Michael Flynn, were leaked by a friend of Comey after his firing in an effort to spark the appointment of a special counsel.When Page was asked about McCabe's memos, she acknowledged she had reviewed some of them, though she said it was mostly for proofreading. House Republicans issued a subpoena for McCabe's memos last year, but the Justice Department did not hand them over, according to a source familiar with the congressional investigation.In his interview with House investigators, Comey was pressed on why he made memos of his conversations with Trump about an ongoing investigation, but not Obama. Comey responded that Obama discussed the Hillary Clinton email investigation "on Fox News" and he didn't need to memorialize such a public comment."The public comments, because they were widely broadcast, were ones that were apparent to the senior leadership team of the FBI," Comey said. "If I didn't tell the senior leadership team of the FBI about my conversation with President Trump, they wouldn't otherwise know and couldn't help me figure out what to do with what was potential obstruction of justice."The FBI officials were interviewed as part of the Republican House investigation into the FBI's conduct in the Clinton and Trump investigations, which ended after Democrats took control of the House this month.	0
36	Congressional Democrats on Sunday pledged heightened scrutiny of President Trump’s dealings with Russia, spurred on by news reports of extraordinary secrecy surrounding his conversations with Russian President Vladimir Putin and the opening in 2017 of an FBI counterintelligence probe into whether Trump worked on behalf of the Kremlin.Trump’s Republican allies in Congress and his administration defended him, impugning the motives of federal investigators, insisting the White House had been tough on Russia and denouncing as “ludicrous” any suggestion that Trump had been compromised by Moscow.The intensifying Russia-related furor coincides with a partial government shutdown that pushed over the weekend into a record-shattering fourth week. More than three-quarters of a million federal workers have been furloughed or are working without their salaries, missing their first paychecks of 2019 last week.There was little sign of any imminent breakthrough in ending the shutdown, whose effects are being more broadly felt with each passing week. Trump spent Sunday morning demanding on Twitter that Congress allocate funds for building a wall on the border with Mexico, a project Democrats vehemently oppose.In snowy Washington, the president called into a conservative talk show on Saturday night to denounce a report in the New York Times that in 2017, after Trump fired FBI Director James Comey, the FBI opened a counterintelligence investigation into whether the president was acting as an agent for Russia.Asked by Fox News personality Jeanine Pirro whether he had ever “worked for Russia,” Trump fumed, but did not take the opportunity to directly respond to the query.“I think it’s the most insulting thing I’ve ever been asked – I think it’s the most insulting article I’ve ever had written,” he replied.On Sunday news shows, several leading congressional Democrats expressed deepening concerns over Trump and Russia, following the New York Times report and a Washington Post story about Trump’s strenuous efforts to conceal what was said in face-to-face talks with Putin over the past two years.Delaware Democratic Sen. Chris Coons, interviewed on “Fox News Sunday,” called word of a counterintelligence investigation “alarming,” and said it underscored the need for the wide-ranging Russia investigation by special counsel Robert S. Mueller III to proceed unimpeded.Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) said on NBC’s “Meet the Press” that in order to open a counterintelligence probe of a sitting president, the FBI must have had a “very deep level of concern.”With a new Democratic majority in the House, freshly anointed committee chairmen are pledging to use their expanded powers to look into Trump and Russia, including the ability to subpoena witnesses and sensitive documents.Rep. Eliot L. Engel (D-N.Y.), who now heads the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said his panel would hold hearings about what he called Trump’s “bizarre relationship with Putin and his cronies.”In a statement issued Saturday night and tweeted out again on Sunday, Engel suggested that secrecy about what was said when Trump met with the Russian leader – to the extent of keeping his own national security team in the dark -- was of paramount concern.“Every time Trump meets with Putin, the country is told nothing,” Engel said. “America deserves the truth, and the Foreign Affairs Committee will seek to get to the bottom of it.”Republican allies of the president said the acts of concealment described by the Post, including Trump’s demand that an interpreter hand over the U.S. side’s only notes of a private meeting with Putin in Hamburg, Germany, were well within his authority.Speaking on CNN’s “State of the Union,” Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), noted that “this is not a traditional president.”“He has unorthodox means,” Johnson said. “But he is president of the United States. It’s pretty much up to him in terms of who he wants to read in to his conversations with world leaders.”Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Burbank), chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said Democrats had been stymied in earlier efforts to learn what was said between Trump and Putin during a summit last year in Helsinki, Finland – but signaled that was about to change.“Last year, we sought to obtain the interpreter’s notes or testimony, from the private meeting between Trump and Putin,” he said in an announcement. “The Republicans on our committee voted us down. Will they join us now?”Schiff, a former federal prosecutor, added: “Shouldn’t we find out whether our president is really putting ‘America first’?”Secretary of State Michael R. Pompeo, who is traveling in the Middle East, dismissed the possibility that Trump acted on Russia’s behalf, calling it an “absolutely ludicrous” notion.“The idea that’s contained in the New York Times story, that President Trump was a threat to American national security, is silly on its face, and not worthy of a response,” he told CBS’ “Face the Nation.”The ranking Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, Sen. Mark R. Warner of Virginia, said it was “curious” that as investigations were getting underway in 2017, “you had Vladimir Putin policies almost being parroted by Donald Trump.”Asked on “State of the Union” whether he thought Trump ever worked on behalf of the Russians and against American interests, Warner said: “That’s the defining question of our investigation, and the Mueller investigation.”He added: “You had Trump say only nice things about Putin. He never spoke ill about Russia.”Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), one of Trump’s staunchest defenders, suggested that the FBI’s reported counterintelligence investigation pointed to malfeasance on the part of senior bureau officials.“It tells me a lot about people running the FBI,” Graham, a onetime Russia hawk, said on “Fox News Sunday” when asked about the Times report. He blamed news leaks by people “with an agenda.”While Trump’s purported toughness on Russia has been a major talking point among his defenders, Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) said Sunday he would force a vote on a resolution to disapprove of the administration’s decision to ease sanctions on companies connected to Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska. Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin announced plans to relax the sanctions last week.Calling the Treasury Department’s proposal “flawed,” Schumer issued a statement Sunday urging the Senate to “block this misguided effort” by the administration. A simple majority would be needed to proceed.Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), meanwhile, played down the latest Russia revelations as of little interest to anyone outside the nation’s capital.“Washington is obsessed with this,” he said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” Beyond the Beltway, the interstate highway ringing Washington, he said, “I don’t find anybody concerned with this at all.”	0
37	U.S. President Donald Trump avoided directly answering when asked whether he "currently is or has ever worked for Russia" after a published report said law enforcement officials, concerned about his behaviour after he fired FBI director James Comey in 2017, had begun investigating that possibility.Trump said it was the "most insulting" question he'd ever been asked, as he spoke to Fox News interviewer Jeanine Pirro, a personal friend, on Saturday night about a New York Times article published on Friday.He never answered Pirro directly about working "for Russia," but went on to assert that no president has taken a harder stance against Russia than he has."I think it's the most insulting thing I've ever been asked," Trump said. "I think it's the most insulting article I've ever had written, and if you read the article you'll see that they found absolutely nothing.""If you ask the folks in Russia, I've been tougher on Russia than anybody else, any other ... probably any other president, period, but certainly the last three or four presidents," he said.Concerns reportedly led to investigationA second prominent newspaper, the Washington Post, is also reporting that Trump had dealings with the Kremlin that raised suspicions.Both cite unidentified former law enforcement officials and others familiar with the allegations.In a Post article published Sunday, the paper reported that Trump has gone to "extraordinary lengths" to keep the details about his conversations with Russian President Vladimir Putin under wraps.The Post said Trump "took possession of the notes of his own interpreter" after meeting with Putin in 2017 in Hamburg, Germany. The Times reported on Friday that Trump was investigated after he fired Comey. Agents allegedly feared Trump was acting in the interests of Russia, and against the United States, in the early months of his presidency, and that gave federal law enforcement officials reason to begin an investigation.Slow to implement sanctions, Democrat saysTrump's claim that he's been tougher on Russia than any recent president was disputed by the top Democrat on the Senate intelligence committee.Virginia Sen. Mark Warner said almost all the sanctions on Russia arose not in the White House but in Congress, due to concerns by members of both parties about Moscow's actions. Warner accused the White House of being very slow to put in place the penalties.Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer says he'll force a vote in the coming days on the Treasury Department's decision to ease sanctions on three companies connected to Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska.The Times reported that FBI agents and some top officials became suspicious of Trump's ties to Russia during the 2016 presidential campaign, but didn't open an investigation at that time because they weren't sure how to approach such a sensitive probe.Trump's behaviour in the days around Comey's May 2017 firing helped trigger the counterintelligence part of the probe, according to the newspaper.In the inquiry, counterintelligence investigators sought to evaluate whether Trump was a potential threat to national security. They also sought to determine whether Trump was deliberately working for Russia or had unintentionally been influenced by Moscow.Trump tweeted early Saturday that the report showed that the FBI leadership "opened up an investigation on me, for no reason & with no proof" after he had fired Comey.Robert Mueller took over the investigation when he was appointed special counsel soon after Comey's firing. The overall investigation is looking into Russian election interference and whether Trump's campaign co-ordinated with the Russians, as well as possible obstruction of justice by Trump. The Times says it's unclear whether Mueller is still pursuing the counterintelligence angle.Sen. Chris Coons, a Delaware Democrat, said the report "may well suggest what it was that helped start this investigation in the first place."He and other Democratic senators said this report and others within the past week questioning Trump's behaviour toward Russia give new urgency to the need for the Mueller investigation to be allowed to run its course.Trump's lawyer Rudy Giuliani told the Times he had no knowledge of the inquiry but said that since it was opened a year and a half ago and they hadn't heard anything, indicating apparently "they found nothing."Trump has also repeatedly and vociferously denied collusion with the Russians.Warner spoke Sunday on CNN's State of the Union and Coons on Fox News Sunday.Warner weighed in on the Trump-Putin summit last year in Helsinki, Finland, telling CNN, "The American government does not know what was discussed between Trump and Vladimir Putin in that frankly pathetic, embarrassing encounter where Trump was kowtowing on the world stage to Vladimir Putin in Helsinki."	0
38	Russia chose the most advantageous candidate and used cyber bots to catapult Trump to the position of U.S. president, Tamir Pardo saysFormer Mossad chief Tamir Pardo said Monday that Russia deployed tens of thousands of bots to influence the 2016 U.S. elections in favor of Donald Trump, but not because Trump is a great friend of Russia.Speaking at The Marker's digital conference, Pardo said that it seems to him that the Russians simply chose to support the candidate that would be the most politically advantageous for them.Pardo said they took a look at the political map in Washington, "and thought, which candidate would we like to have sitting in the White House? Who will help us achieve our goals? And they chose him. From that moment, they deployed a system [of bots] for the length of the elections, and ran him for president."Many experts at the conference spoke of the dangers posed by bots, computer programs designed to run automatically and mimic the cyber behavior of a real user.Is there a business opportunity here for Israel's cyber companies? Not necessarily, Pardo said.In an interview with Sami Peretz, the ex-Mossad head said that “what we’ve seen so far with respect to bots and the distortion of information is just the tip of the iceberg. It is the greatest threat of recent years, and it threatens the basic values that we share – democracy and the world order created since World War Two."The use of bots and fake information on the web is a global issue that Israel must be prepared to handle, Pardo said. On the digital battlefield war is clean, compared to the death and destruction of physical battlefields. But, Pardo noted, they pose real threats to humanity and to Israel on the web, and the democratic nations should act quickly.Politicians may believe they can use the bots to their advantage, but the consequences will come back to haunt them, Pardo continued. As an example, he said that Trump may think the bots worked in his favor, but it is the same bots that are liable to topple him. Politicians hold the key to stopping the chaos created by the bots, he concluded.	0
39	MOSCOW — President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia on Thursday hailed the decision by President Trump to withdraw United States forces from Syria, calling it “correct” because the American troops were not needed.Mr. Putin’s praise came a day after Mr. Trump said he was ordering the withdrawal because the United States military had achieved its goal of defeating the Islamic State militant group in Syria. Given the unfinished business on the ground in Syria, however, the move was a surprise to many, including some senior presidential military and diplomatic advisers in Washington.The decision has been criticized, even among Republicans, as abandoning Kurdish allies in the face of a hostile Turkey and a still dangerous Islamic State, as well as leaving Syria open territory for the geopolitical ambitions of Russia and Iran.Mr. Putin’s response came during his annual news conference, a marathon, four-hour affair during which he suggested several times that Mr. Trump was being thwarted by those who did not accept his victory as president.He suggested that his problems in arranging a second meeting with Mr. Trump after their July summit in Helsinki stemmed from domestic American opposition, and he predicted the interference was only going to get worse.“Now, the majority in Congress will change and one can project with 100 percent certainty that there will be new attacks launched against the incumbent president, and whether he will be able to launch a direct dialogue with Russia, I don’t know,” Mr. Putin said.Mr. Putin said he broadly agreed that the Islamic State, sometimes known by the acronyms ISIL or ISIS, had been defeated in Syria, although analysts estimate it still commands a force of 15,000 fighters. “With regards to the victory over ISIL, on the whole I agree with the president of the United States.”The Russian leader expressed skepticism, however, that the United States would follow through on Mr. Trump’s pronouncement, noting that the government had similarly pledged to pull out of Afghanistan by 2014 but still stations forces there.“We don’t see any signs yet of the withdrawal of U.S. troops,” he said. “How long has the United States been in Afghanistan? Seventeen years? And almost every year they say they’re pulling out their troops.”Mr. Putin reiterated the Kremlin position that American forces have no legal right to be in Syria, in that they were neither invited by Damascus, as the Russian forces were, nor authorized by the United Nations Security Council.The American decision to withdraw represented at least a tactical victory for Mr. Putin, who intervened in Syria in September 2015 with the primary goal of re-establishing Russia as a power to be reckoned with in the Middle East, analysts said.“For now, it is really good news for Putin,” said Konstantin von Eggert, a political commentator on the independent Russian TV station Dozhd. “Putin’s main goal from Day 1 of his intervention was to establish himself as the global authority to prevent regime change. In this he has succeeded.”But Mr. Putin still faces some challenges in Syria. The Islamic State, while mostly lying low, remains a potentially potent guerrilla force in the eastern desert region, he and others noted. With the Americans out of the way, he will inherit that fight, which he largely avoided while propping up Mr. Assad’s control over most of western Syria.“ISIS is not defeated. I am sure the Russians know that very well,” said Yuri Barmin, a fellow at the Russian International Affairs Council who specializes in Middle Eastern affairs. “If the Americans are not there to fight it, then who will? It will have to be Russia.”The American presence also helped to glue together a Kurdish-Arab alliance in the east that is likely to unravel in its absence, he said.The withdrawal could present problems in the western theater in the Syrian conflict as well. Not only will it remove the hurdle preventing Iranian forces from advancing unimpeded down the road from Iraq into Syria, but it could also fuel ambitions within the Syrian and Iranian forces to capture Idlib province, the last holdout of the armed opposition.That in turn could cause problems with Turkey, which has supported the opposition and is no friend to Russia’s client, President Assad.Any surge in fighting would also puncture the calm that Russia has sought to establish in order to push the troubled political process forward and get others on board with talks about money for reconstruction, Mr. Barmin noted.For now, however, Mr. Putin savored the moment, using the news conference to hit on a favorite theme: that Russia is a pocket of stability compared with the disintegrating West. He said the Anglo-Saxon world was undergoing “tectonic shifts” with both the election of Mr. Trump and the vote by Britons to leave the European Union, or Brexit.“Trump has won, which is an obvious fact, but not everyone is willing to accept this victory,” Mr. Putin said. “They have been doing their utmost to delegitimize their president.”Britain faced similar problems with the Brexit referendum, he said. “No one recognizes the results, and the democratic procedures have been unraveling,” he said.Russia has been accused of manipulating both the 2016 American election and the Brexit referendum through social media and, possibly, through illicit campaign cash, but Mr. Putin made the statements without any apparent irony, nor did he refer to the accusations.	0
40	BUENOS AIRES — President Trump on Thursday abruptly canceled his planned meeting with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, citing the unresolved naval standoff between Russia and Ukraine and upending his hopes of further cementing the relationship between the two leaders.The president’s decision, announced on Twitter barely an hour after he told reporters he still expected to go through with the meeting, came shortly after new revelations that Mr. Trump’s personal lawyer had negotiated to build a tower in Moscow much later during the 2016 presidential election than previously acknowledged.The last-minute cancellation underscored just how fraught the Russian-American relationship has grown despite the president’s concerted efforts to make friends, as the Kremlin increasingly asserts itself overseas while Washington is absorbed by the investigation into ties between Mr. Trump’s circle and Moscow.When Mr. Trump met with Mr. Putin in Helsinki last summer, it came just days after the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, had indicted 12 Russian intelligence officers in the hacking of Democratic emails during the 2016 campaign. Undaunted, Mr. Trump went ahead with that meeting and, with Mr. Putin at his side, challenged the conclusions of American intelligence agencies about Russian election interference.The Buenos Aires session, which had been scheduled for Saturday on the sidelines of the Group of 20 economic summit meeting, was only the second to be canceled between top American and Russian or Soviet leaders since an American U-2 spy plane piloted by Francis Gary Powers was shot down over Russian territory in 1960. The other time came in 2013 when President Barack Obama called off a trip to Moscow to protest Mr. Putin’s decision to shelter Edward J. Snowden, the National Security Agency leaker.Mr. Trump has adamantly denied any collusion with Russia during the campaign and dismissed questions about business ventures or economic interests in Russia. But Michael D. Cohen, his former personal lawyer and fixer, admitted in court on Thursday that he had engaged in negotiations for a Moscow tower well into the campaign and had personally briefed Mr. Trump and members of his family.The president said that Mr. Cohen was “weak” and lying in order to reduce his sentence for various criminal charges, adding that while a Moscow tower had been considered, he had opted against it because he was running for president. But Mr. Trump insisted that there would have been nothing wrong with pursuing such a project as a candidate if he had.Even as he denounced his former lawyer on Thursday morning, Mr. Trump told reporters that he still planned to go ahead with his meeting with Mr. Putin.“I probably will be meeting with President Putin,” he told reporters on the South Lawn of the White House just after 10:30 a.m. as he left on the trip to Buenos Aires. “I think it’s a very good time to have the meeting.” He added that he would be getting a report on Air Force One about the Russia-Ukraine confrontation “and that will determine what I’m going to be doing.”At 11:34 a.m., he reversed himself, announcing on Twitter that he would scrap the meeting after all, attributing the move to the Ukraine conflict. Russian forces seized three small Ukrainian naval vessels and more than 20 sailors on Sunday, including at least three wounded in a shooting by the Russian side.“Based on the fact that the ships and sailors have not been returned to Ukraine from Russia, I have decided it would be best for all parties concerned to cancel my previously scheduled meeting in Argentina with President Vladimir Putin,” Mr. Trump wrote.“I look forward to a meaningful Summit again as soon as this situation is resolved!” he added.Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, told reporters on Air Force One that Mr. Trump had scrubbed the meeting after reviewing the report on Russia’s actions against Ukraine. Mr. Trump conferred with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and John F. Kelly, the White House chief of staff, who were on the plane, and by telephone with John R. Bolton, his national security adviser, who was in Brazil.But a meeting with Mr. Putin also could have raised questions about Mr. Trump’s ties to Russia after Mr. Cohen’s revelations, producing an politically uncomfortable moment.Russia analysts noted that nothing had changed in the Russian-Ukrainian standoff in days and that Mr. Trump had not seen it necessary to scratch the meeting before.“This is a no-brainer,” said Michael Carpenter, senior director of the Penn Biden Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement and a former Pentagon official under Mr. Obama.“It’s all about the political optics in light of the Trump Tower Moscow news and the fact that Trump simply can’t bring himself to ever confront Putin in public,” Mr. Carpenter said. “This would have been a P.R. disaster of epic proportions if he had agreed to meet and not confronted Putin.”Sign Up for On Politics With Lisa LererA spotlight on the people reshaping our politics. A conversation with voters across the country. And a guiding hand through the endless news cycle, telling you what you really need to know.SIGN UPOnce again, however, Mr. Trump’s ad hoc decision-making caught a foreign government unawares. Dmitri S. Peskov, the Kremlin spokesman, told Russian reporters that they had seen Mr. Trump’s Twitter posting but had no other word from the American government.“We don’t have official information,” he said, according to the Tass news agency. He added, “If this is so,” then Mr. Putin “will have a few additional hours in the schedule for useful meetings on the sidelines of the summit.”Other sub-dramas were percolating in Buenos Aires as Mr. Trump flew on Thursday. The president downgraded scheduled meetings with two allies, Presidents Moon Jae-in of South Korea and Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey, without explanation. Instead of full-fledged sessions, the president will have “pull-asides” with both, according to the White House, meaning casual chats on the sideline of the main sessions.At the same time, speculation focused on whether Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada would attend the ceremonial signing on Friday of the revised version of the North American Free Trade Agreement, which Mr. Trump has rebranded the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement. Mr. Trudeau’s schedule did not include the ceremony, but a Canadian official late Thursday confirmed that he would attend.And then there was Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, who also has a tense relationship with Mr. Trump and was scheduled to meet with him on Friday. Her government plane was forced to land en route to Buenos Aires by technical difficulties and she was reported to be turning to a commercial flight on Friday, an embarrassment for the leader of a major power.Assuming they do meet, Mr. Trump and Ms. Merkel will presumably discuss the Ukraine crisis. While Mr. Trump had said earlier in the week that he was not happy about Russia’s latest aggression, he had left any stronger denunciation to his United Nations ambassador. Members of Congress on both sides of the aisle had called on Mr. Trump to take a tougher stance and even cancel the meeting with Mr. Putin.Mr. Trump had been seeking another meeting with Mr. Putin for months, first suggesting the Russian leader visit the White House and later trying to arrange to sit down together in Paris earlier this month, but neither idea went ahead. Instead, the two leaders settled on Buenos Aires for their next meeting.The session was already freighted by multiple tension points between the two countries in addition to the lingering issues of the election meddling and the clash with Ukraine.Mr. Trump recently declared that he would withdraw the United States from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty signed by Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev in 1987, citing Russian violations, an issue that was sure to come up. Syria and Iran were other flash points expected to be discussed.Some veteran diplomats said the scrubbed meeting was a missed opportunity to pressure Mr. Putin into easing the conflict with Ukraine and to find a possible compromise that would enable them to salvage the I.N.F. Treaty.“I would have preferred that he had stuck with the meeting and delivered a strong rebuke to Putin for Sunday’s aggression, with a threat of punitive steps if Russia doesn’t quickly release the ships and the crews,” said Alexander Vershbow, who served as ambassador to Russia under President George W. Bush.“But given that Trump may be incapable of doing that, and might have endorsed Putin’s ‘vigorous denials’ that Russia was responsible,” he added, “cancellation may have been the best course.”Molly McKew, a consultant who has advised the leaders of governments threatened by Moscow, said Mr. Trump clearly wanted to avoid having to confront Mr. Putin directly over Ukraine. “Since he doesn’t have the constitution to say it to Putin’s face, he sent it as a tweet,” she said. “In many respects — and to avoid Helsinki 2.0 — this is probably the best outcome. He can say he did it and not end up looking the fool.”	0
