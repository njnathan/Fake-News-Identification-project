691	 In a move that promises to permanently transform the political landscape in the United States, President Obama has signed Executive Order 13752, an order which will radically change the way the United States regulates all weapons. President Obama claims that his authority to draft this order comes from the second amendment: “If you look at the second amendment, you’ll see that it says that ‘a well-regulated militia is necessary to the security of a free state.’ Well, when I see kids getting shot at school and people gunning down their coworkers, I don’t see a well-regulated militia. I don’t see a state that is secure in its freedom. I see a nation in crisis. I see a country in desperate need of reform. If you want to exercise your right to bear arms, that’s fine, but if you want to do that, you should be ready and able to defend your country at a moment’s notice.”Under the new law, nearly every gun in the U.S. will be required to be registered. There are exceptions for single and double barrel shotguns, single shot and double barrel hunting rifles, black powder guns, and any gun made before 1932. No U.S. citizen will be allowed to have more than three guns registered to them at any time. Possession of an unregistered firearm, expect those exempted from registration, will be a felony that carries a mandatory minimum sentence of ten years in federal prison. States that refuse to enforce the new laws will lose federal highway and Medicaid funding.	0
192	Jake Turx is a newly minted White House correspondent for a publication that has never before had a seat in the White House press corps: Ami Magazine, an Orthodox Jewish weekly based in Brooklyn. He is a singular presence in the briefing room: a young Hasidic Jew with side curls tucked behind his ears and a skullcap embroidered with his Twitter handle. When President Trump called on him at a news conference on Thursday, saying he was looking for a “friendly reporter,” Mr. Turx was prepared. He had spent an hour crafting a question about a recent surge of   with a preamble that he hoped would convey his supportive disposition toward Mr. Trump. But the exchange did not go the way he expected. A few hours later, with the clip replaying on social media and Jewish groups issuing news releases, Mr. Turx, 30, was still reeling. He said in a telephone interview, “Regretfully, today was a day I wish we could have done over. ” His editor, Rabbi Yitzchok Frankfurter, watched aghast from the magazine’s offices as his young correspondent received a   from the president: “It was a very disheartening moment for us, to watch him being berated. ” The exchange began with Mr. Turx standing up from his   seat and gesturing slightly toward his fellow reporters: “Despite what some of my colleagues may have been reporting, I haven’t seen anybody in my community accuse either yourself or anyone on your staff of being  . We understand that you have Jewish grandchildren. You are their zayde,” which is Yiddish for “grandfather” and often a word of great affection. At that Mr. Trump nodded slightly, and said, “thank you. ” “However,” Mr. Turx continued, “what we are concerned about and what we haven’t really heard being addressed is an uptick in   and how the government is planning to take care of it. There’s been a report out that 48 bomb threats have been made against Jewish centers all across the country in the last couple of weeks. There are people committing   acts or threatening to —   —  ” At that, Mr. Trump interrupted, saying it was “not a fair question. ” “Sit down,” the president commanded. “I understand the rest of your question. ” As Mr. Turx took his seat, Mr. Trump said, “So here’s the story, folks. No. 1, I am the least   person that you’ve ever seen in your entire life. No. 2, racism, the least racist person. ” Mr. Turx tried to interject, realizing how the encounter had turned. He said he had wanted to clarify that he in no way meant to accuse Mr. Trump of   but instead intended to ask what his administration could do to stop the   incidents. But Mr. Trump would not let him speak again, saying, “Quiet, quiet, quiet. ” As Mr. Turx shook his head with an incredulous look on his face, Mr. Trump accused him of having lied that his question would be straight and simple. Mr. Trump said, “I find it repulsive. I hate even the question because people that know me.   …    ” He went on to say that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, during his visit to the United States on Wednesday, had vouched for Mr. Trump as a good friend of Israel and the Jewish people and no  . Mr. Trump concluded that Mr. Turx should have relied on Mr. Netanyahu’s endorsement, “instead of having to get up and ask a very insulting question like that. ” “Just shows you about the press, but that’s the way the press is,” Mr. Trump said. At the news conference, Mr. Turx was referring to a rash of incidents that have shaken many American Jews since Mr. Trump was elected. On three separate days in January, Jewish synagogues, community centers and schools across the country received what seemed to be a coordinated wave of telephone bomb threats that led to evacuations and F. B. I. investigations. Other Jewish institutions have seen an uptick in vandalism and graffiti in the last few months. It was the second time in two days that Mr. Trump was asked to denounce   and offer American Jews a dose of reassurance. In his joint news conference with Mr. Netanyahu, Mr. Trump responded to a question about   by breezily recounting the size of his Electoral College victory and then reminding the reporters that his daughter, Ivanka, his    Jared Kushner, and their three children  —   Mr. Trump’s grandchildren  —   are all Jewish. The   League issued a statement on Thursday that said, “It is   why President Trump prefers to shout down a reporter or brush this off as a political distraction. ” David Harris, chief executive of the American Jewish Committee, said, “Respectfully, Mr. President, please use your bully pulpit not to bully reporters asking questions potentially affecting millions of fellow Americans, but rather to help solve a problem that, for many, is real and menacing. ” Surveys show that Mr. Trump was not the choice of the majority of American Jews, who tend to vote for Democrats and came out in force for Hillary Clinton. Many Jews have been critical of Mr. Trump for not more forcefully denouncing   and racists like David Duke, a former leader of the Ku Klux Klan who endorsed Mr. Trump during the campaign. Many Jewish leaders are also wary of Stephen K. Bannon, Mr. Trump’s White House strategist, because of the close affinity between Breitbart News, which he once ran, and the white supremacists in the movement known as the  . On Friday, the leaders of Reform Judaism, which includes more than a third of American Jews and is the largest stream of American Judaism, announced that they opposed the confirmation of David M. Friedman as ambassador to Israel. The leaders said in a statement that Mr. Friedman, who has supported Israeli settlements in the West Bank, was unqualified, intemperate and held “extreme views” on Israel that will endanger “both American and Israeli security. ” Mr. Trump was popular among many Orthodox Jews. They were reassured to see the Orthodox Jews in his family and attracted to his hawkish line on Israel, his support of vouchers for religious schools and his promise to ban Muslim immigrants from entering the country. Rechy Frankfurter and her husband, Rabbi Frankfurter, founded Ami Magazine more than six years ago to serve a conservative Jewish audience. It circulates in the United States, Canada, Europe and Australia and is one of several   news publications serving the   community. Ami Magazine comes out weekly and has three sister publications: one for women, one for teens and a cooking magazine called Whisk. The magazine interviewed Mr. Trump before he declared he was running for president and did so again during the campaign. “We didn’t do a political endorsement of him, but I really wanted the president to be elected, and I do want him to succeed,” said Rabbi Frankfurter, the editor in chief. Mrs. Frankfurter, the magazine’s senior editor, said it was clear that Mr. Trump was not an   and that Mr. Trump “must have misheard the question” from the magazine’s reporter. “The president is very sensitive to such an accusation, and we find the fact that he’s sensitive to it reassuring,” she said, because it means he understands how awful it is to be thought of as an  . Rabbi Frankfurter, whose parents survived the Holocaust, said, “Perhaps the president should speak out more vigorously than he has. He’s got a bully pulpit, and he should use it for good reasons. ” After the news conference, Mr. Turx, a pen name, said that he had had conversations on Thursday evening with White House staff members and that he and members of the Orthodox Jewish community were “extremely confident” that the White House would give “the proper help, guidance and collaboration” on  .	1

380	Warren E. Buffett, the billionaire investor, on Saturday lauded the “miraculous” qualities of the United States economy in highlighting another stellar year for his company, Berkshire Hathaway. Mr. Buffett, whose record of beating the stock market over the past 50 years is unparalleled, is known for being persistently optimistic about the prospects of the American economy. But his usual hymn to the dynamism of the American economy in his annual letter to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders that was released on Saturday morning reached new heights. “Americans have combined human ingenuity, a market system, a tide of talented and ambitious immigrants, and the rule of law to deliver abundance beyond any dreams of our forefathers,” Mr. Buffett wrote. He was a vocal supporter of Hillary Clinton during last year’s presidential campaign and he did not mention President Trump in his letter. But his celebration of the American economy’s ability to deliver growth stands in stark contrast to President Trump’s darker descriptions of the country’s economic prospects. That Mr. Buffett went out of his way to give credit to a “tide of talented and ambitious immigrants” was also worthy of note in light of the Trump administration’s crackdown on immigrants. Last year was another outstanding one for the man known widely as the Oracle of Omaha. Berkshire Hathaway’s stock price was up 23 percent in 2016, about double the return on the Standard  Poor’s 500 index. Berkshire’s operating companies, which include the insurance firm Geico, the railroad company BNSF and numerous others, also performed well in an improving economy, with operating earnings increasing to $17. 5 billion in 2016 from $17. 3 billion in 2015. Mr. Buffett’s investment letters, which accompany Berkshire’s report, are highly anticipated. After all, he is 86 years old, sitting on a mountain of $85 billion in cash and, as a recent documentary about his life made clear, showing little sign of slowing down. Mr. Buffett also revealed in his letter that a recent bet on Apple had paid quick dividends. He owns a 1. 1 percent stake in the company that he purchased at a total cost of $6. 7 billion. His 61 million shares are now worth over $8 billion. Over the years, Mr. Buffett has had a complicated relationship with Wall Street. He has been a withering critic of the culture of high pay, group think and excessive fees yet he has also swooped in to buy big stakes in investment firms when they hit rough times. In his 2016 letter, Mr. Buffett took special aim at hedge funds, which in recent years have faced persistent outflows of investor money because of poor performance, stubbornly high fees and a broad move toward cheaper, passive options like index funds and   funds. Underscoring his   thesis that, over time, highly paid   hotshots lose out to a cheap index fund, Mr. Buffett presented the latest results of a bet he made nine years ago. Since then, a standard S  P index fund overseen by Vanguard is up 85 percent, easily outpacing the hedge funds’ return of 22 percent. Annually, the gap is just as wide: 7 percent for the index fund and 2. 2 percent for the hedge funds. As usual, Mr. Buffett did not mince words in expressing his astonishment as to how elite investment professionals could register such mediocre returns while raking in steep fees. “I’m certain that in almost all cases the managers at both levels were honest and intelligent people. But the results for their investors were dismal  —   really dismal,” he wrote. “And, alas, the huge fixed fees charged by all of the funds and    involved  —   fees that were totally unwarranted by performance  —   were such that their managers were showered with compensation over the nine years that have passed. ”	1
609	 In keeping with the Republican party’s platform of proposed safeguards, Palin also called for advanced screening for all teachers:“If foreign elements can swimmingly cross over the river and through the woods, they can just as easily infiltrate the teaching profession in ways we must not encourage. These dangerous foreign walk-overs who look more and more like real every-day normal Americans, lured with gift baskets and teddy bears, often blend into the very footholds of our societal norms after establishing dangerous toeholds.”Palin, known as a vocal and athletic supporter of Donald Trump, said that she is now a “double-barreled, locked and loaded supporter” of both Trump’s and Ted Cruz’s proposed guidelines for stricter immigration laws, border protections and neighborhood “scrutinies.”-An earlier version of this report incorrectly stated Mrs. Palin’s call for the removal of Aerobics from physical education courses. The author regrets the error.	0
603	 NBA legend and Charlotte Hornets‘ owner, Michael Jordan, held a press conference today, announcing his intentions to move the Hornets out of North Carolina if the state does not revoke its controversial HB2 law.“With this new law in place, North Carolina currently does not have any anti-discrimination protection in place, something that is vital, not just for our fans but for everyone,” Jordan told reporters. “We are giving the state of North Carolina 30 days to repeal this law or they can expect the the Charlotte Hornets to play elsewhere. I want to make it clear that neither the Hornets nor I will not stand for this type of intolerance and hate.” “As my organization has stated previously, the Charlotte Hornets and Hornets Sports & Entertainment are opposed to discrimination in any form, and we have always sought to provide an inclusive environment,” Jordan said in a statement to the Observer in response to an interview request regarding HB2, the North Carolina law called by some as discriminatory toward the LGBT communityAs has been the case since the building opened, we will continue to ensure that all fans, players and employees feel welcome while at work or attending NBA games and events at Time Warner Cable Arena.”	0
739	 An incident coming out of Greenville, North Carolina is just one example of what some people will do around the holidays when they are short on cash. A 34-year-old mother of 3 is now under arrest after a shoplifting incident turned tragic. Witnesses say Shatuanee Greene entered the North Carolina Walmart on Sunday with her three children ages 5, 7, and 8 when she grabbed a can of pre-made Christmas cookie dough. CCTV footage shows the young mother take the can to the toy aisle as her children crowded around her. Greene then lifted up her skirt and made the can of cookie dough “disappear.”When Greene was approached by Walmart security, she told her children to go find their Aunt in the front of the store. “I told her to hand over the cookie dough,” said Timothy Reiner, a security guard at Walmart. “That’s when she turned around to run and I grabbed her by the arm. She put up a good fight, and that’s when I tackled her to the ground. Then I heard a loud pop and the lady started screaming. Gooey cookie dough was running down her leg. All hot and runny … it was so damn gross.”According to eyewitnesses, the EMT that treated Greene on the scene said the Pillsbury cookie dough can exploded in Greene’s vagina during the fall causing her extreme pain. They removed the contents at the scene.	0
766	 Is McDonald’s closing 17,000 stores because of the $15.00 minimum wage? The largest chain of fast food restaurants in the world has announced that the minimum wage increase from $8.75 an hour to $15 an hour has caused them to schedule the close 17,000 restaurants in the United States. With already decreasing profits, McDonald says this is the “straw that broke the camels back.”	0
512	 Reacting reflexively to the Indiana governor’s speech while watching a live feed backstage at the Republican National Convention, GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump accidentally shot off a “Boring Mike Pence” tweet Wednesday night before he could stop himself. “Boring Mike Pence lacks any charisma or charm,” Trump’s tweet about his running mate read in part, adding that the Tea Party–aligned conservative was a “total disaster” and “very hard to watch.” “Doing a lousy job. Knows nothing about winning. Pathetic.” Trump, who reportedly noticed that the social media post had quickly received over 10,000 retweets, instinctively fired off three more tweets questioning Pence’s fitness for vice president.	0
972	 (Oslo, Shithole) After being singled out by President Trump as a preferable source of immigration compared to ‘shithole’ nations like Haiti and many countries in Africa, Norway has taken the drastic step of renaming itself to show it does not approve of such behavior.[…]“We Norwegians are a pragmatic people who don’t much care what the country is called. If renaming it Shithole sends a progressive message of goodwill then that’s what being Norwegian is all about.” Welcome to Breaking Burgh, a satirical blog serving Western Pennsylvania and beyond.In case you read that too quickly, it’s SATIRE, so put that lawyer back in your pocket.

994	 It is unknown if he met anyone in the multiple days he was gone, but the attack occurred when three other members of his unit went out searching for him.“I don’t want to raise the alarm yet, but it seems that he was trying to pull a Bergdahl,” said the soldier, who discussed the situation on condition of anonymity because he is not authorized to talk about it. “It seems suspicious that these terrorists were waiting for them.” At no point since the Niger attack has DOD ever considered Sgt. La David Johnson anything less than an honorable soldier who sacrificed his life for our country. The author of the article about a deceased soldier being a deserter decided to pull the story, and I fully support his decision.It was pointed out to us that we should have used a fake name and photo, and we agree. The author got so caught up in paraphrasing an actual conversation he saw on Breitbart that he didn’t think to do that because he was so furious with those idiots. He agrees with the general sentiment that he was wrong in not changing the facts more like we normally do.This page and all its affiliated pages and websites are committed to posting nothing but pure satirical fiction, and we regret that facts made their way into our narrative.As always, thank you for your continued support, and I offer a personal apology to the family of the soldier in the story. The revenue from the article will be donated to Operation We Are Here, a relief fund for Gold Star families. Do I feel responsible for them sharing it even though I wrote it? Not at all. There is a mob of liberals waiting to fact check righties who believe the stories. There are as you mentioned disclaimers telling them not to believe it. The Facebook page itself makes fun of people on a daily basis for buying this crap. They have every opportunity to think “hey, this might not be true” and take thirty seconds to Google something but spend that time instead saying a bunch of racist bullshit.…Nothing I write comes from me. It’s based on comments I see on right-wing websites. I just bring their idiotic fantasies to life so they can make bigger fools of themselves. This story, for example, is based on some ridiculous speculation I saw on Breitbart’s Facebook page last night. Some parts of it are almost direct quotes. I’m not giving them new stupid ideas. They already have them. In some cases, I take requests from liberals who want to see them freak out about something ridiculous, but it’s almost always something I saw idiots talking about.	0
877	 Baby born with stigmata of Jesus Christ Is this true? It is reported in the Filipines (Philipines?), I believe.   Jejomar Castillo was born on the morning of March 15, weighting 3.2 kilograms and bearing strange injuries on his face, hands and feet. These surprising sores are almost identical to the famous wounds suffered by Jesus, including the head wounds associated with the Crown of thorns and the wounds caused by the crucifixion itself.Rumors of a “miraculous child” rapidly spread across the hospital, then across the city, and a large crowd rapidly gathered outside the boy’s room and even around the hospital. Within a matter of hours, thousands of people surrounded the building in silent prayer.The crowd has now been there for two days, praying and chanting religious slogans like “Welcome to the Saviour” and “Thank you God for sending Jejomar”. Many of the people on the site seem to associate the birth of this enigmatic child with the biblical Return of Jesus Christ.

356	SHANGHAI  —   As a top stock market regulator, Guo Shuqing cemented a reputation as an economic reformer who tried to bring   changes to China’s   and heavily politicized financial system. During just 17 months in the role, he issued 80 major directives, moving to stop chronic insider trading, curb market manipulation and remove barriers for foreign investors. It earned him the occasional nickname Whirlwind Guo. Now Mr. Guo has returned to Beijing to tackle an even bigger problem: the murky,   Chinese banking system. On Friday the state news media said that he was named chairman of the China Banking Regulatory Commission, succeeding Shang Fulin, who had reached the mandatory retirement age of 65. The Chinese commercial news media widely reported and filmed Mr. Guo’s arrival at that agency on Friday morning, where he was greeted by Mr. Shang. Mr. Guo’s appointment offers a sign that China is taking a financial overhaul seriously, though it was made among other moves that could send mixed signals about that commitment. The stakes are high: Experts widely believe that China’s weak financial system is holding back its economy, the world’s second largest. China is trying to broaden its economy beyond its traditional dependence on manufacturing, but its financial system still operates on a      model that has generated alarming amounts of debt even as it hinders money from reaching entrepreneurs. Bad loans are widely expected to soar as the economy continues to slow. At the same time, banks have become increasingly dependent on raising money through often speculative investment products that they keep off their balance sheets, making it hard to assess the risks they pose to financial stability. Yet other appointments suggested a commitment to the status quo. The state news media on Friday said the No. 2 officials at the National Development and Reform Commission, China’s top economic planning body, and the Ministry of Commerce, which oversees trade, among other things, were named to succeed their retiring bosses, who were also 65. The choice to run the National Development and Reform Commission, He Lifeng, served from 2009 to 2012 as the deputy secretary of Tianjin. He helped oversee the construction of a forest of office and residential skyscrapers at the city’s fringes that have barely been occupied and have become one of the many symbols of China’s dependence on   growth that is often wasteful. China could signal its commitment to a financial overhaul with any changes at the top of its central bank, the People’s Bank of China. Zhou Xiaochuan, widely considered a reformist voice in China, is more than two years past retirement age, so predicting his departure has become a popular parlor game in China’s financial world. Appointing Yi Gang, Mr. Zhou’s deputy, to the top could be seen as an endorsement of Mr. Zhou’s gentle advocacy of reform, though elevating Mr. Yi could also reflect Beijing’s lack of interest in rocking the boat. The shuffle comes at a delicate time for China’s financial leadership. Its competence was called into question in 2015, when conflicting signals contributed to a stock market crash and increased government controls. Experts say either the banking commission or the central bank could get added responsibilities should China try to streamline financial regulation. Mr. Guo faces an immediate challenge in reasserting the authority of the banking commission, also known as the C. B. R. C. Like the Federal Reserve in the United States, the Chinese central bank has clawed away from banking regulators a considerable part of their authority to oversee whether banks are lending prudently. The Chinese central bank has also played an increasingly critical role in fighting money laundering and capital flight. “An appointment as the head of the C. B. R. C. today is not as significant as the same appointment five years ago because the People’s Bank of China has taken over many of the regulatory oversight tasks,” said Victor Shih, a specialist in Chinese finance and factional politics at the University of California at San Diego. China could tip its hand on that matter after the annual gathering of the National People’s Congress, its top lawmaking body, which begins March 5. It may then hold a   financial work conference in April on reorganization that was originally planned for January or February. Some experts viewed the recall of Mr. Guo to Beijing as a sign that policy changes are coming. “It’s probably a signal for fundamental reforms in China’s financial regulatory framework,” said Zhu Ning, a Tsinghua University economist. Mr. Guo could be in a good position to argue that the China Banking Regulatory Commission should have greater authority. He missed the spectacular plunge of the Chinese stock markets in 2015, the blame for which fell in part on his successor. In a country where officials tend to either have political experience in running provinces, or economic and financial experience in working at regulatory agencies and   banks in Beijing, Mr. Guo is a rare example of someone who has done both. He served as a deputy governor of impoverished Guizhou Province in the late 1990s, then as director of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange. He then became the chairman of the China Construction Bank, one of China’s four main banks, from 2005. He took the top job at the China Securities Regulatory Commission, the top stock market regulator, in late 2011, unleashing a fury of reform efforts in just 17 months. Then just as quickly, he was gone, sent south to coastal Shandong Province as the acting governor. Rather than a setback to his career, it was another way to develop his economic and political chops. Within months, he rose to become the governor of Shandong Province, helping clean up the financial sector there. Political analysts had said that Mr. Guo might stay in Shandong and be promoted to Communist Party secretary, the top job, above even the governor. Previous party secretaries of Shandong, a large and economically important province, have sometimes joined the Politburo, a top Communist Party leadership group, and gone on to become vice premiers with broad economic powers. Vice premiers are much more important in China than the governor of the central bank, because the central bank has no political independence in China and answers to the cabinet. Time may be running out for Mr. Guo, who will turn 61 this year. The ministers who run the central bank and the main regulatory commissions typically retire at 65, making it harder for Mr. Guo to do a stint at the banking commission and then move on to another senior position.	1

287	CAIRO  —   The bodies of 74 migrants were recovered from a beach near the town of Zawiya in western Libya, rescuers said on Tuesday, an ominous sign before the high season for Mediterranean crossings. The bodies were believed to have come from a shipwrecked inflatable raft that was found on the same stretch of shore, said Mohammed Almosrti, a spokesman for the Libyan Red Crescent. Some of the bodies were found inside the stricken raft. The rubber boat left Libya for Italy on Saturday and appears to have been left drifting without an engine for several days, said Flavio Di Giacomo, a spokesman for the International Organization for Migration in Rome. “It’s really strange that smugglers would take off the engine,” he said. “They are becoming increasingly cruel. ” Red Crescent workers spent seven hours collecting the bodies on Monday afternoon, and the organization posted photographs of dozens of    body bags lined up on a beach. Three of the dead were said to be women. Given the capacity of the boat, which could hold up to 120 people, the death toll is expected to rise, Mr. Almosrti said. The tragedy was a stark reminder about what may lie ahead during the main migration season in Libya, the principal springboard for most African migrants seeking to get to Europe. Although the illegal trade usually slows for the winter, at least 228 people died in January while trying to reach Italy, mostly in smaller boats and inflatable vessels, according to the European Border and Coast Guard Agency. The bodies that washed up near Zawiya, a smuggling hub 30 miles west of Tripoli, the capital, appeared to be a further sign that greater numbers were starting to set off. “Usually they wait until April or May, and it continues until October,” Mr. Almosrti said. “If they are starting strong like this, it means we could see a lot of deaths this year. ” The route between Libya and Italy was the site of a record number of deaths last year, when at least 4, 579 people died, Fabrice Leggeri, head of the European Border and Coast Guard Agency, said last week. The toll for 2015 was about 3, 000. Libya was the departure point for many of the estimated 180, 000 migrants who reached Italy last year. The migrants, most of whom are fleeing war or poverty in Africa, often arrive in Libya after arduous journeys through the desert. They entrust their lives to smuggling gangs that have set up along a   stretch of coast in western Libya, which is largely controlled by an array of rival militant groups. Italy recently trained 89 members of the Libyan Coast Guard, hoping they will take distressed boats back to Libya instead of allowing them to continue to Italy. The Italian initiative is part of a broader European effort to stem the flow of migrants that includes financing for, and training to set up, holding centers for migrants in Libya. But the plan depends largely on assistance from the United   unity government, one of several rival governments in Libya. The unity government has limited control in Tripoli and in a few towns along the coast. News of the Italian training program, however, may be accelerating the migrant crossings. Mr. Di Giacomo, of the International Organization for Migration, said some smugglers were urging migrants to leave now before the Libyan Coast Guard could thwart their departure. “The smugglers are using this information to convince the migrants that this is the moment to go,” Mr. Di Giacomo said. “For them, it’s a way of doing more business. ”	1
154	NORTH ARLINGTON, N. J.  —   College roller hockey teams from across the Northeast, including Pennsylvania State University, competed at an indoor arena here recently, shooting, skating and stickhandling with gusto as they battled to climb the standings and win for their teammates and for school pride. But one team, the Maccabees of Yeshiva University, was playing for something loftier  —   religious devotion and the quest to bring glory to Orthodox Jews. “When we go out there, wearing Yeshiva across our chest, it reflects not just on our school but on our whole religion,” Avi Margulies, 22, one of the team’s founders, said after the team improved its record to  . In their second season, the Maccabees, named for a band of ancient Jewish freedom fighters, are doing their faith proud and bringing athletic acclaim to this college in northern Manhattan better known for training religiously devout students than turning out powerhouse sports teams. This unlikely band of Orthodox Jewish students is tearing up the Eastern Collegiate Roller Hockey Association, against teams with few or no Jewish players and more resources. The   squad was founded last season with little fanfare or financial assistance from the university. The players spend most of their time immersed in intense studies of the Talmud and the Torah, but Sundays are for hockey. Because of Sabbath restrictions, they cannot play the usual Friday and Saturday games scheduled by the league. Instead, they must play multiple games Sunday mornings, starting as early as 7 a. m. and playing up to four games, sometimes back to back against fresher teams. On a recent Sunday morning at the New Jersey rink, the Maccabees’ fans far outnumbered  —   and stood out  —   from those rooting for the other teams. The men wore skullcaps and the women dressed in prim dark skirts. Joe Klein, part of a group of classmates at the rink, said the team’s credo was “Play hard to pray hard” and likened the team to a biblical David bringing down Goliaths. “They live for the fact that they’re going to be the underdogs,” said Akiva Blumenthal, another Yeshiva student. After all, most of the teams at the rink hailed from large universities like Penn State and the University of Delaware, with   hockey programs that receive money from their schools and are unencumbered by religious strictures. The Yeshiva team showed up at the rink before 7 a. m. and squeezed into a cramped locker room. Putting on a uniform included pulling a helmet over a yarmulke and strapping padding over a white, tasseled religious shawl, known as a tallit. They had already finished a lengthy prayer session and were facing a grueling three games. Last season, they played in Division 4, which is for newer teams. They lost one game all season and won the league championship, earning them the right to play this season in the more competitive Division 2 league against teams like Boston University and Northeastern. Still, they are currently in first place and are a favorite to win the league championships in March in Pennsylvania. The Maccabees will most likely qualify for the national championship in Florida in April, said William Bourque, the commissioner of the Eastern Collegiate Roller Hockey Association, and their performance there could enable them to move to the top division, whose teams have bigger budgets that include team buses and plane travel to games. Mr. Bourque said he was impressed by the team’s quick success, especially since new teams typically struggle to achieve a winning record. “It’s very rare that a team comes in and becomes a top team right away,” he said. “They’re probably the   team out there. They probably don’t have the most talented players, but they have the best teamwork. They want it more than anyone else. ” The game is essentially played on an ice hockey rink with a hard surface. Body checking is forbidden but play is still scrappy, with plenty of contact. Players use a hard plastic puck and wear   skates and padding. Maccabee players and supporters regard the team’s unlikely accomplishment as something of a miracle. “Growing up as an Orthodox kid, you can’t play in the roller hockey leagues because they don’t cater to the orthodox lifestyle,” said Amir Gavarin, who also helped start the team and is the captain. “So you wonder if you can play with the gentiles. We’re trying to prove to the community that we can hang with them. ” The team is largely an outgrowth of the avid floor hockey scene in orthodox high schools in and around New York City. Some top players who ended up attending Yeshiva University were recruited by Mr. Margulies and Mr. Gavarin. Many of the players, including one of the goalies, Joseph Robin, had to develop skating skills. Two of the team’s stars, Avi Edell and Ari Drazin, grew up in Canada playing ice hockey and had to learn how to play on wheels instead of blades. Being a club rather than a varsity sport means the team is not eligible for athletic department funding, school officials said. Still, the team is hoping to persuade the school to provide some financing, Mr. Gavarin said. The players had to raise money to buy uniforms and equipment, pay league fees, cover travel expenses and even to hire a coach, Ely Gemara. League officials warned the Yeshiva players that holding games on Sunday mornings could mean having to play before sunrise. “We told them, ‘Guys, it’s going to be really, really hard,’ but they’ve taken everything in stride,” Mr. Bourque said. Because of the players’ rigorous study schedules, it has been tough to schedule practices, and rental fees are steep at rinks on Long Island and in New Jersey. They also practice at an outdoor public rink on First Avenue in Manhattan. This season, the team had to skip preseason games because they fell during the High Holy Days in October. Players said their travel logistics could be as challenging as their opponents. While other teams show up in team vans, the Maccabees scramble to assemble car pools. With kosher and Sabbath restrictions, even hotel stays are tricky. Team members often stay with orthodox families, sometimes sleeping on attic floors or in cold garages. There was also the necessity of packing their own kosher food  —   which usually meant cold meals  —   and fitting morning, afternoon and evening prayer sessions between car trips to games across the Northeast. The toll of travel hit the team at its very first game, in Rhode Island. After praying in a cold, dark parking lot, the team seemed in a daze as their opponents scored 15 seconds into the game. The Maccabees, however, woke up and rallied to a lopsided   victory. By season’s end, several of the players won league honors, but could not attend a Friday night banquet. Instead, league officials presented the awards the following Sunday in a locker room. There have been awkward moments. Last season, at a rink on Long Island, the opposing team could not conceal its surprise after walking into a locker room to find the Maccabees in   prayer together in Hebrew. “You should have seen the shock on their faces,” Mr. Gavarin said. Some   fans travel hours to road games. At the rink in New Jersey, they were crestfallen when the team blew a   lead against Stony Brook University, and lost   in overtime. But they revived when the Maccabees beat Delaware University and trounced Penn State in a game that featured Mr. Drazin and Jesse Gordon combining on a dazzling Maccabees goal. The two players initially met while studying the Talmud in Israel before playing together. Now they make up the team’s first offensive line. Mr. Gavarin acquired his love for the game from his father, Barry Gavarin, who began playing a primitive form of hockey at his own yeshiva in the 1960s, first kicking the puck on an outdoor makeshift ice rink and then buying sticks and skates with his classmates as a break from religious study. The younger Mr. Gavarin said he and his teammates considered being both devout Jews and ferocious competitors a way to encourage other young observant Jews to break out of the often “insulated” world of Orthodox Jewish life. “We’re opening up a whole new viewpoint and worldview for Orthodox kids,’’ Mr. Gavarin said, “because they can see that if you work hard enough you can play with anybody. ”	1
114	WASHINGTON  —   Russia has secretly deployed a new cruise missile that American officials say violates a landmark arms control treaty, posing a major test for President Trump as his administration is facing a crisis over its ties to Moscow. The new Russian missile deployment also comes as the Trump administration is struggling to fill key policy positions at the State Department and the Pentagon  —   and to settle on a permanent replacement for Michael T. Flynn, the national security adviser who resigned late Monday. Mr. Flynn stepped down after it was revealed that he had misled the vice president and other officials over conversations with Moscow’s ambassador to Washington. The   cruise missile at the center of American concerns is one that the Obama administration said in 2014 had been tested in violation of a 1987 treaty that bans American and Russian   missiles based on land. The Obama administration had sought to persuade the Russians to correct the violation while the missile was still in the test phase. Instead, the Russians have moved ahead with the system, deploying a fully operational unit. Administration officials said the Russians now have two battalions of the prohibited cruise missile. One is still located at Russia’s missile test site at Kapustin Yar in southern Russia near Volgograd. The other was shifted in December from that test site to an operational base elsewhere in the country, according to a senior official who did not provide further details and requested anonymity to discuss recent intelligence reports about the missile. American officials had called the cruise missile the   . But the “X” has been removed from intelligence reports, indicating that American intelligence officials consider the missile to be operational and no longer a system in development. The missile program has been a major concern for the Pentagon, which has developed options for how to respond, including deploying additional missile defenses in Europe or developing   or   cruise missiles. Russia’s actions are politically significant, as well. It is very unlikely that the Senate, which is already skeptical of President Vladimir V. Putin’s intentions, would agree to ratify a new strategic arms control accord unless the alleged violation of the   treaty is corrected. Mr. Trump has said the United States should “strengthen and expand its nuclear capability. ” But at the same time, he has talked of reaching a new arms agreement with Moscow that would reduce arms “very substantially. ” The deployment of the system could also substantially increase the military threat to NATO nations, depending on where the highly mobile system is based and how many more batteries are deployed in the future. Jim Mattis, the United States defense secretary, is scheduled to meet with allied defense ministers in Brussels on Wednesday. Before he left his post last year as the NATO commander and retired from the military, Gen. Philip M. Breedlove warned that deployment of the cruise missile would be a militarily significant development that “can’t go unanswered. ” Coming up with an arms control solution would not be easy. Each missile battalion is believed to have four mobile launchers with about half a dozen   missiles allocated to each of the launchers. The mobile launcher for the cruise missile, however, closely resembles the mobile launcher used for the Iskander, a     system that is permitted under treaties. “This will make location and verification really tough,” General Breedlove said in an interview. While senior Trump administration officials have not said where the new unit is based, there has been speculation in press reports that a missile system with similar characteristics is deployed in central Russia. American and Russian relations were on a better footing in December 1987 when President Ronald Reagan and Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the Soviet leader, signed an arms accord, formally known as the   Nuclear Forces Treaty and commonly called the I. N. F. treaty. As a result of the agreement, Russia and the United States destroyed 2, 692 missiles. The missiles the Russians destroyed included the  . The Americans destroyed their Pershing II ballistic missiles and   cruise missiles, which were based in Western Europe. “We can only hope that this   agreement will not be an end in itself but the beginning of a working relationship that will enable us to tackle the other urgent issues before us,” Mr. Reagan said at the time. But the Russians developed buyer’s remorse. During the George W. Bush administration, Sergei B. Ivanov, the Russian defense minister, suggested that the treaty be dropped because Russia still faced threats from nations on its periphery, including China. The Bush administration, however, was reluctant to terminate a treaty that NATO nations valued and whose abrogation would have enabled Russia to build up forces that could potentially be directed at the United States’ allies in Asia, as well. In June 2013, Mr. Putin complained that “nearly all of our neighbors are developing these kinds of weapons systems” and described the Soviet Union’s decision to conclude the I. N. F. treaty as “debatable to say the least. ” Russia began testing the cruise missile as early as 2008. Rose Gottemoeller, who was the State Department’s top arms control official during the Obama administration and is now the deputy secretary general of NATO, first raised the alleged violation with Russian officials in 2013. After years of frustration, the United States convened a November 2016 meeting in Geneva of a special verification commission established under the treaty to deal with compliance issues. It was the first meeting in 13 years of the commission, whose members include the United States, Russia and three former Soviet republics that are also party to the accord: Belarus, Kazakhstan and Ukraine. But Russia denied it had breached the treaty and responded with its own allegations of American violations, which the Americans asserted were spurious. The Obama administration argued that it was in the United States’ interest to preserve the treaty. Having failed to persuade the Russians to fix the alleged violation, some military experts say, the United States needs to ratchet up the pressure by announcing plans to expand missile defenses in Europe and deploy   or   nuclear missiles. “We have strong tools like missile defense and counterstrike, and we should not take any of them off the table,” General Breedlove said. Franklin C. Miller, a longtime Pentagon official who served on the National Security Council under Mr. Bush, said the Russian military may see the cruise missile as a way to expand its target coverage in Europe and China so it can free its strategic nuclear forces to concentrate on targets in the United States. “Clearly, the Russian military thinks this system is very important, important enough to break the treaty,” Mr. Miller said. But he cautioned against responding in kind by seeking to deploy new American   nuclear missiles in Europe. “The last thing NATO needs is a bruising debate as we had in the late ’70s and early ’80s about new missile deployments in Europe,” Mr. Miller added. “The United States should build up its missile defense in Europe. But if the United States wants to deploy a military response, it should be  . ” Jon Wolfsthal, who served as a nuclear weapons expert on the National Security Council during the Obama administration, said the United States, its NATO allies, Japan and South Korea needed to work together to put pressure on Russia to correct the violation. The response, he wrote on Twitter, should be taken by the “alliance as a whole. ” The Trump administration is in the beginning stages of reviewing nuclear policy and has not said how it plans to respond. “We do not comment on intelligence matters,” Mark Toner, the acting State Department spokesman, said. “We have made very clear our concerns about Russia’s violation, the risks it poses to European and Asian security, and our strong interest in returning Russia to compliance with the treaty. ”	1
400	People in parts of South America and Africa were treated to a rare sight on Sunday: a “ring of fire” eclipse, when the moon moves in between the Earth and the sun, briefly replacing it with a blazing, fiery ring. An event of this kind  —   technically called an annular eclipse  —   is a byproduct of the moon’s elliptical nature around the Earth, which means it is sometimes further away from the planet than at other times. An annular eclipse is one that happens when the moon is unable to completely block our view of the sun because it is at one of its greater distances from Earth. The countries with the best chance of viewing an annular eclipse are those that lie along the path of annularity, an invisible line that traces the path taken by the moon’s shadow as it moves across the globe, according to C. Alex Young, a solar astrophysicist from NASA. They include Chile and Argentina in South America and Angola, Zambia and the Democratic Republic of Congo in Africa, where viewers were able to see the full “ring of fire” effect for roughly one minute. Skywatchers on the ground in those countries  —   including more than a few government agencies  —     their experience on Sunday, with some complaining that overcast weather dampened their views. People outside the direct path of annularity could still get a glimpse of the show although it was only be a partial eclipse. For everyone else, there is always the internet. Slooh Community Observatory, a system of telescopes, broadcast the eclipse online via live stream beginning around 7 a. m. Eastern time on Sunday. Americans will also get to watch an eclipse of their own soon enough. A total solar eclipse is due on Aug. 21.	1

490	Snapchat is a business built in large part on disappearing messages and adding animated dog ears and flower crowns to users’ selfies. As of Thursday, that business is worth about $34 billion  —   more than the market value of the   media company CBS, and about three times the size of another social media company, Twitter. Snapchat has made paper billionaires of its   founders five times over. In making its stock market debut in spectacular fashion  —   its shares rising 44 percent on their first day of trading  —   Snapchat’s parent, Snap Inc. has blazed a trail for other technology darlings like Uber and Spotify that remain privately held. It elated Wall Street institutions eager for a prominent initial public offering when few had surfaced for months. The company has entranced investors despite a litany of red flags, like enormous losses that are expected to persist for years, a slowdown in its   user growth rates, and an ownership structure that gives Snapchat’s founders control for decades to come. Then there are the shadows of onetime tech highfliers that have since crashed to earth. Twitter was valued at nearly $32 billion at the end of its first day of trading Wall Street now values it at roughly $11 billion and has called for the company to sell itself. An earlier force in social media, Myspace, sold itself to Rupert Murdoch’s News Corporation for $580 million in 2005 six years later, it was sold to Justin Timberlake and other investors for $35 million. Some analysts have already shown skepticism about the newest publicly traded tech giant. One, Brian Wieser of Pivotal Research Group, says the share price should be $10, far below the company’s offering price of $17, which itself was above the initial range predicted. Snap faces competition from larger companies and the challenge of a   user base, he said. Boosters of Snap’s prospects argue instead that Snap has the potential to become less like Twitter and more like its biggest rival, the $395 billion Facebook. These supporters point to some of the company’s obvious strengths: the 158 million people on average who used Snapchat each day by the end of 2016 the roughly 18 times a day that those users opened the app on average the $404 million in sales that it collected last year, up from nothing three years ago. For now, investors appeared to focus on the positive. Snap raised $3. 4 billion in its market debut, the most by an American tech company since Facebook’s initial offering in 2012, according to data from Renaissance Capital. It was the first significant tech stock sale since at least December. And the 44 percent pop in its stock price was the biggest enjoyed by a company of a   I. P. O. since Twitter’s debut in 2013. More than 217 million shares traded on Thursday, as some investors bought and others cashed in, exceeding the number of shares Snap sold in the I. P. O. For investors in other   unicorns  —   a term for   valued at more than $1 billion  —   the immense success of Snap’s deal highlights the appetite for a tech darling, even if the company still bleeds money. Count Uber, Spotify and Airbnb within that group. “The sound you’re hearing today after the Snap I. P. O. is the happy snapping of fingers of   unicorns and their investors,” said Kathleen Smith, a principal at Renaissance Capital. “It looks like Snap has set the path to monetization. ” In countless meetings during a   roadshow with investors, Snap executives sought to rebut some of the biggest concerns about the company’s prospects. Slowing growth toward the end of last year stemmed from problems with the service’s Android app. Competition from Facebook, which openly copied some of Snapchat’s signature features at Instagram, would do little to dent user enthusiasm. And the company would continue to press innovations, such as the branded lens filters that transform users into monsters, fairies or Taco Bell tacos, and that have become new forms of advertising beloved by brands. Potential new ideas include drones and   cameras. By Wednesday night, Snap’s bankers had drawn up their list of the investors who would get the first shares, largely big mutual funds and some hedge funds, all with the aim of picking firms that are most likely to stick around for the long term. The I. P. O. minted wealth for others that invested when it was a younger company, including big venture capital firms like Benchmark Capital and a high school in the Bay Area. Unlike newly public companies that seek to celebrate their first day of trading on the stock markets, Snap kept its festivities largely confined to the New York Stock Exchange. The company’s top executives and board members gathered there for a   breakfast, where guests were presented with pins in the shape of Snapchat’s ghost mascot. Evan Spiegel, 26, and Bobby Murphy, 28, Snap’s founders, briefly addressed the crowd, uncharacteristically clad in suits and ties rather than their customary  . They also presented exchange officials with their version of the customary gift given by market debutants: one of the vending machines that sell the company’s Spectacles,   sunglasses that send   videos to the app. (The machine won’t be refilled once it sells out of Spectacles.) Then the founders walked through the floor of an exchange bedecked in the company’s signature yellow  —   the color splayed on electronic boards, wrapped around water bottles and leaping off some executives’ ties. One Snap employee had ducked into the Hermès store down the street to pick up a yellow tie days before just for the occasion. Mr. Spiegel’s fiancée, the supermodel Miranda Kerr, enthusiastically documented the day on her own Snapchat Story and posed for selfies. Attendees on the floor could unlock a special filter that placed the company’s ghost mascot in their videos, holding virtual Snapchat balloons and ejecting a rainbow from its mouth. At 9:30 a. m. Mr. Spiegel and Mr. Murphy rang the Big Board’s opening bell and then briefly basked in the adulation. Snap’s chief strategy officer, Imran Khan, escorted his family around the exchange and posed for pictures with fellow employees. But by the time Snap’s shares opened for trading at $24 each  —   which was later in the morning  —   the company’s top executives had disappeared from the floor, heading to the nearby offices of one of the banks involved in the public offering, Goldman Sachs, to watch the opening. Then many staff members trekked to Snap’s Midtown Manhattan offices to head back to work.	1
105	Lt. Gen. Harold G. Moore, whose fortitude saved most of his outnumbered battalion in 1965 in the first major battle between American and North Vietnamese troops  —   exploits immortalized in a book and a movie starring Mel Gibson  —   died on Friday at his home in Auburn, Ala. He was 94. His death was confirmed by his son Col. David Moore who, like his brother Lt. Col. Stephen Moore and their father, was a West Point graduate. General Moore recounted his battlefield heroics in 1992 in a   book, “We Were Soldiers Once   …     and Young,” written with Joseph L. Galloway. Mr. Galloway, as a    war correspondent for United Press International, had witnessed the battle, one of the war’s bloodiest, in the Ia Drang Valley in November 1965. Mr. Gibson played General Moore in “We Were Soldiers,” the 2002 film adaptation of the book. “He was a phenomenal man of great strength and character, courageous and like a father to his troops who got most of his boys out of there after he landed in a hornet’s nest,” Mr. Gibson, who visited the general a few months ago, said on Monday in a phone interview. General Moore later fended off an antiwar protest by Jane Fonda at a California base and oversaw the sweeping transition to an   Army after the war. But no moment in his   military career was as transformational as the brief American victory at Ia Drang, in shaping both his heroic reputation (he was George Armstrong Custer’s heir as commander of the Seventh Cavalry Regiment) and his view that America’s combat role in Vietnam was futile. “It wasn’t our place to question,” General Moore wrote with Mr. Galloway in a   book, “We Are Soldiers Still: A Journey Back to the Battlefields of Vietnam” (2008). “We were soldiers and we followed their orders. In times and places like this, where the reasons for war are lacking, soldiers fight and die for each other. ” The North Vietnamese retreated after the battle, but they went on, with the Vietcong, to wage a successful guerrilla war that ended in 1975 with the fall of Saigon, the South Vietnamese capital. Years after General Moore retired from active duty in 1977, he visited Ia Drang with his North Vietnamese battlefield counterpart for an ABC documentary, publicly supported a global ban on the production and use of   land mines, and likened the American invasion of Iraq to the protracted war in Vietnam, which, he wrote, ended after 10 years “with a hasty withdrawal just ahead of defeat. ” “His mantra,” his son David said, was “Hate war, love the American soldier. ” General Moore did both. Nicholas Proffitt, a former war correspondent, wrote of “We Were Soldiers Once” in The New York Times Book Review, “General Moore’s respect and affection for his troops is evident on every page, and one can understand why he became one of the legendary commanders in Vietnam. ” And why he hated war. “As a glimpse into the abyss, into the bilious reality of war, it is a revelation,” Mr. Proffitt wrote. “As a reading experience, it’s a car crash of a book you are horrified by what you’re seeing, but you can’t take your eyes off it. ” On Nov. 14, 1965, Hal Moore, at the time a lieutenant colonel and battalion commander, and about 450 troops from his First Battalion were ferried by helicopters to Landing Zone   a field near the Drang River in South Vietnam, six miles from the Cambodian border. They stumbled on more than they had bargained for: three North Vietnamese regular army regiments that at times outmanned them 12 to 1. “By midafternoon in   heat we were strongly outnumbered, taking heavy casualties in a cliffhanger fight to the finish,” the general wrote in a West Point yearbook. Bloody    combat ensued on a battlefield punctuated by termite mounds the size of pickup trucks and bodies strewn amid the elephant grass. Never leaving the combat zone and remaining in the thick of the fight, General Moore delivered on a vow that endeared him to his troops: “I’ll always be the first person on the battlefield, my boots will be the first boots on it, and I’ll be the last person off. I’ll never leave a body. ” Finally, reinforcements and the firepower of helicopter gunships,   and American 105 mm howitzers positioned several miles away turned the tide. “Unlike Custer,” General Moore said later, referring to Custer’s Last Stand in 1876 at the Little Bighorn, “we had major fire support. ” The American death toll at   was 79. As the reinforcements marched to a second landing zone named Albany, they suffered heavy casualties in an ambush that was largely covered up at the time. When the combat in both places ended, as many as 3, 000 North Vietnamese and 234 Americans were dead. By the end of November, the American toll in the Ia Drang Valley had risen to 305, branding it as the Valley of Death. “Every one of us thought at least once we were going to die there,” Mr. Galloway said in an interview on Monday. “There was only one man who thought for certain we were going to prevail, and that was Hal Moore. ” Harold Gregory Moore Jr. was born on Feb. 13, 1922, in Bardstown, Ky. then a city of about 2, 000, where his father was an insurance agent. His mother was the former Mary Crume. He was 15 when his father first suggested he consider West Point, provided he got a required recommendation from a United States senator. As a high school senior, though, all Hal was able to extract from Senator A. B. (Happy) Chandler was a patronage job in the Senate warehouse in Washington. By the time he graduated from George Washington University in 1942, though, World War II had begun, and more appointments to military academies were available. This time he was successful, making it to West Point and graduating in 1945. His wife, the former Julie Compton, died in 2004. In addition to his sons David and Stephen, he is survived by another son, Harold Gregory Moore III, known as Greg two daughters, Julie Moore Orlowski and Cecile Moore Rainey a sister, Betty Karp a brother, Ballard 12 grandchildren and four  . After West Point, General Moore served in the Korean War and in Europe. He was deployed to Vietnam in 1965 and was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross for valor at Ia Drang. Returning to the United States, he was assigned to plan for the withdrawal of troops from Vietnam commanded Fort Ord in California, where he dealt with antiwar demonstrators, including Ms. Fonda and was named the Army’s deputy chief of staff for personnel in Washington. General Moore likened Ia Drang to the Spanish Civil War before World War II: a dress rehearsal for the tactics that both sides would employ for the rest of the war and a harbinger of a prolonged stalemate in seesaw battles over territory. “He never claimed that was an American victory, but he prevailed,” Mr. Galloway said. “At the end of the day they left and we still occupied the ground, although after we left they came back. ”	1

219	ATHENS  —   During seven years of a grinding economic crisis, Dimitri Tsamopoulos has lost at least half the clients from his once bustling tax consultancy. But in the past few months, business has jumped, not because the Greek economy is finally recovering but because it is falling even deeper into the abyss. With the Greek government pushing through more tax increases to comply with austerity requirements, more than 21, 000   workers and small firms have shut down in the past two months, with many seeking help from accountants like Mr. Tsamopoulos to close their books. Yet many are not actually closing their businesses. “Most of these people will keep working,” Mr. Tsamopoulos said, arching an eyebrow from behind his desk as clients waited in a smoky room outside. “But now, they’ll do it on the black market. They’re saying they need a way to survive. ” Greece is the crisis that never quite goes away for the European Union, and with another tense negotiation with creditors scheduled for this coming week, the country is struggling to recover from the longest downturn in the eurozone. The   policies and reform medicine required by creditors have done little to revive growth, leaving Greece even more dependent on the three international bailouts the country has received since 2010. Few problems are more ingrained, or harder to combat, than the shadow economy, which appears to be growing again as new austerity measures compel once   Greeks to go off the books. Greece’s black market is estimated at 20 to 25 percent of the gross domestic product, as more people have stopped reporting their income to avoid paying taxes that, by some estimates, have risen to 70 percent of an individual’s gross income. As of last month, unpaid taxes in Greece had soared to 95 billion euros, up from €76 billion two years ago. Most of that is considered uncollectable. “The heart of the matter for an   number of citizens and businesses is that they simply do not have the financial resources anymore to meet their rising tax obligations,” said Jens Bastian, an economist and a member of a team of European Union specialists that helped supervise the country’s earlier bailouts. Short on alternatives, he said, “many are falling back into the gray economy. ” Shutting down this gray economy is a priority for Greece’s creditors, even as the two sides are bracing for another showdown, with Athens and its creditors arguing over the latest bailout, worth €86 billion. Greece is aiming to strike a deal with creditors by Monday, when European finance ministers meet in Brussels to assess if Athens has done enough in overhauling the economy  —   and combatting tax evasion  —   to unlock bailout funds. Blended into that equation is a standoff between the International Monetary Fund and European countries over how much more austerity to require of Greece. The I. M. F. wants European creditors to further reduce Greece’s mountainous debt, now at 180 percent of economic output, warning that it will spiral out of control otherwise. The European Union is already juggling different crises, including the rise of political populism and the withdrawal of Britain from the bloc, so the possibility of another Greek monetary crisis is alarming. The country risks defaulting on its debts by July, reviving concerns about its place in the eurozone. Businesses and individuals, meanwhile, are struggling to cope in an economy that suffered a devastating shock in 2015, when Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras imposed capital controls and brought Greece to the brink of exiting the euro. Despite a mild recovery, the economy shrank again in the fourth quarter, leaving many Greeks scornful of promises of growth by Mr. Tsipras, whose popularity has slumped. An essential piece of Greece’s recovery plan has been to collect more taxes from a population that has long engaged in tax evasion. An independent tax authority was created and auditors were hired, helping to pull in about €5 billion more in revenue than expected last year. But businesses and individuals say they have less to give for taxes that keep rising, and a growing incentive to avoid paying. Unemployment remains about 23 percent, and for some people the shadow economy is a lifeline. Others see it as a way to prevent a government they don’t trust from putting their money into a black hole, which is the national debt. Electricians, plumbers, hairdressers, journalists, computer consultants and a variety of other   workers have all taken the plunge. On a recent afternoon, Yiannis, a young television production designer, stood in line in a government office to   as a consultant. Had he not, he said, his   pay this year would amount to just 30 percent of earnings. “It’s like they force you to become illegal,” said Yiannis, who, like many people, refused to give his full name for fear of attracting the tax authorities. “Of course I’m going to work on the black market. I need to make ends meet. ” Yiannis said he had also registered a company in Bulgaria, where the business tax rate is 10 percent, so that he could keep issuing receipts for freelance work. Tens of thousands of Greeks have been registering companies in Bulgaria, Cyprus, Luxembourg and other   countries to avoid paying the higher tax bills at home  —   which means less revenue for Greece’s coffers and creates unfair competition for   entrepreneurs who could potentially play a bigger role in the revival of Greece’s economy. Periklis Ladas, 28, opened a small company in 2014 to sell and install safety equipment and fire prevention systems. Despite the crisis, business at the firm, Knox, grew briskly. Soon, though, Mr. Ladas faced competition from shadow economy operators who offered clients cheaper prices. When he bid on a contract to fireproof a new building, another firm offered to work off the books for half his rate. Mr. Ladas won the job because he provided insurance that the competitor could not. But he had to lower his price, sapping revenue that he wanted to reinvest in the business. More income was lost when clients bought his equipment and hired    electricians for the installation. “We’re trying to be responsible,” said Mr. Ladas, who wants to build a future in Greece rather than leave, as his friends have done. “But it’s hard to compete against others who don’t pay the same tax as you. ” The revenue that he does earn is steadily being eaten away. When he opened, he kept around 60 percent of his profit, after taxes. Today, his take is about 30 percent, after tax increases approved by the Greek government to meet   and revenue targets imposed by creditors. “Those who play by the rules are the ones getting punished,” Mr. Ladas said. Even electricians, in a profession rife with shadow economy workers, complain about the competition. In a brightly lit office in central Athens, members of the national electricians union huddled around a table one evening to discuss their plight. “We’re fighting against people who don’t pay taxes,” said Emmanouil Kafkalas, the general secretary, adding that at least half of electricians worked in the shadow economy. “We’re losing work because they can charge less. ”	1
314	ISTANBUL  —   Women in the Turkish armed forces have been given the right to wear Islamic head scarves in a move that represents a significant cultural shift within an institution seen historically as the guardian of Turkey’s secular identity. The military was one of the last Turkish institutions to forbid the wearing of the hijab. Just 10 years ago, the military’s commanders briefly implied that they would intervene if a presidential candidate, whose wife wore a veil, became head of state. The candidate, Abdullah Gul, ultimately reached the presidency without obstruction. A decade before that, however, military intervention forced the resignation of an Islamist prime minister. The decision, made on Wednesday and announced by the Defense Ministry, highlights the transformation in the years since of both the military and society, where the head scarf has long been emblematic of the struggle between the country’s secular and religious factions. Since 2002, the government of Recep Tayyip Erdogan has gradually opened the public sphere to veiled women  —   allowing the veil on university campuses in 2011 and in the civil service in 2013. The first veiled judge appeared in court in 2015, while veiled women were permitted to serve in the police force last August. The military’s stance softened somewhat in 2015, when an army court ruled that veiled relatives of soldiers could enter military grounds. The army’s cultural shift was also reflected in last July’s failed coup attempt. The government claims that the putsch was organized by an Islamist faction within the military, an institution previously assumed to be staffed mainly by Kemalists  —   followers of Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, the founder of the secular Turkish state. Women serve only as officers or noncommissioned officers in Turkey. As of 2013, the last year of official data, there were 1, 345 female commissioned officers and 370 female noncommissioned officers out of 723, 741 military personnel in Turkey. The decision to allow female soldiers to wear head scarves threatens to deepen concerns that Mr. Erdogan seeks to sever the country from its secular moorings. Mr. Erdogan’s party has criticized claims that its members are Islamists, believers in a political system based on Islamic legislation. Nevertheless, Mr. Erdogan has increased the number of religious schools and speaks of creating a more pious generation of Turks. After the July coup attempt, Mr. Erdogan also caused alarm in secular circles when he appointed as his military adviser a former   general who was fired from the army a few months before the 1997 military intervention because of concerns about his religiosity. Mr. Erdogan’s toughest critics fear he secretly hopes to create a second Iran, where a teenager was expelled from the national chess team on Monday for refusing to wear a head scarf during a tournament in Spain. Erdogan Karakus, a retired   general and head of the Turkish Retired Officers Association, claimed that Wednesday’s decision was an unnecessary intervention in military affairs and argued that the head scarf was too loaded a symbol for use within the military. “We don’t want to involve politicians in our air force, army, navy,” Mr. Karakus said in a telephone call. “If somebody wants to wear beach clothes in the office in the United States, do you accept it?” But many welcomed the decision. While some criticize Mr. Erdogan for disregarding democratic norms, citing a continuing purge of thousands of people accused of being dissidents, others praise him for bringing dignity to Turkey’s pious majority, which for decades was excluded from public life by the country’s secular elite. What happened on Wednesday was the latest part of that emancipatory process, said Ravza Kavakci, a lawmaker from Mr. Erdogan’s party. “I think it is a very important step in the path of democratization,” she said. Ms. Kavakci’s older sister, Merve, was once one of those particularly affected by discrimination against veiled women. Professor Merve Kavakci is herself a former lawmaker who was screamed at, and later expelled from Parliament, when she arrived at the building wearing a head scarf in 1999. In a separate interview, the elder Ms. Kavakci said that Wednesday’s decision simply made Turkey more tolerant of religion, rather than less secular. She said it would make Turkey more like the United States, where she felt freer to display her religious identity when she lived there. “It’s not that Turkey is not secular any more. It’s that Turkey is no longer secular fundamentalist,” said the elder Ms. Kavakci, now a political scientist and head of postcolonial studies at Uskudar University. “In the past, Turkey has, with its   ideology, embraced a very intolerant secularism where religion was subjugated and controlled by the state authority. And now we’re trying to change that. ” In a statement released later in the day, she added: “From the day I was ousted from the Parliament it’s a dream come true. This is a clear victory for women empowerment. ” Others were more circumspect. Professor Jenny White, an expert on the changing role of Islam and secularism within Turkey, argued that the democratization process was just one of several possible explanations for Wednesday’s intervention. “It could just be completing the process, having everyone everywhere able to wear head scarves, or it could be a way of humiliating the remaining Kemalist officer corps by breaking that last taboo,” said Ms. White, the author of “Muslim Nationalism and the New Turks,” a book about identity in contemporary Turkey. “I would characterize this,” Ms. White added, “as the ultimate humiliation of the Kemalist military. ”	1

58	DAKAR, Senegal  —   Julius Ikena’s trade business is at a standstill because he cannot make electronic payments to his partners. Andrew Mofor cannot get access to the small fortune  —   800 euros, or about $850  —   that his daughter sent him through an online banking system. And Angela Atabong, a    economics student in Cameroon’s capital, can no longer tap out sweet nothings on the internet messaging service WhatsApp to her fiancé, who lives six hours away. All three have been thwarted by Cameroon’s government, which is the latest in   Africa to switch off the internet in parts or all of a nation, or to put other limits on online communication in hopes of snuffing out protests and other opposition. Officials in Cameroon and elsewhere say internet blackouts are a security measure. But they are also a hit to the fragile economies of developing nations that are increasingly reliant on online business transactions as internet access and cellphone use have exploded in recent years. Authoritarian regimes have long limited communication with the outside world during tense times. Most notably in 2011, Egyptian government officials cut internet and mobile network access to 80 million people as thousands of protesters gathered in Tahrir Square in Cairo. Governments in Myanmar, Nepal and other countries have also shut off internet access in recent years. Now,   African governments are increasingly employing the tactic: Blackouts have grown most rapidly in the past two years, researchers say. In recent months, governments in several countries have turned off internet access during elections when violence broke out or was merely expected. In December in Gambia, the president at the time, Yahya Jammeh, a ruthless leader known for human rights abuses, shut off internet services and blocked international cellphone calls as votes were cast in a presidential election that eventually ousted him from office. In Gabon, officials cited security concerns for an internet blackout during presidential elections that prompted deadly demonstrations after the vote was considered by observers to be fraudulent. And in the Republic of Congo, internet access was blocked, television networks switched off and the nation’s main airport closed during an election that spurred violence. Government officials were accused of using airstrikes on opposition forces. Elsewhere on the continent, Ethiopia has shut down some social media sites and internet services after demonstrations. In Zimbabwe, after protests over the travails of daily life, officials raised prices on cellphone data, a move widely seen as an effort to curb the use of social media. Lawmakers also pushed measures to allow the police to intercept data and seize electronics like laptops and cellphones, levying charges of terrorism for misuse. The Democratic Republic of Congo has blocked social media sites and text messaging amid demonstrations over the president’s attempts to extend his tenure in office. Freedom House, an American watchdog organization, said in its annual Freedom on the Net survey of 65 countries that 24 nations experienced restrictions on social media and communications last year, up from 15 countries the previous year. Network shutdowns occurred in 15 countries last year, more than double that in 2015, the survey found. Mai Truong, program manager for the survey, said, “It’s a strategy that the authorities are increasingly turning to as a method of controlling both the information landscape and citizens’ ability to mobilize, in recognition of the fact that the internet has become a fundamental tool for people to realize their rights and participate meaningfully in society. ” The United Nations Human Rights Council last year condemned the practice of intentionally preventing or disrupting access to information on the internet, saying access was a fundamental human right. Network blackouts also have economic consequences. Many residents of some regions of Africa where joblessness is soaring are increasingly using online or mobile transfers to receive money from relatives in urban areas or abroad. If the internet is shut off, users cannot use   to transfer cash and must pay for mobile data to go online. The cost is prohibitive for many people. Between July 1, 2015, and June 30, 2016, 81   internet shutdowns in 19 countries cost at least $2. 4 billion in gross domestic product globally, according to Darrell M. West, founding director of the Center for Technology Innovation at the Brookings Institution. “As the digital economy expands, it will become even more expensive for nations to shut down the internet,” he wrote in an October analysis. “Without coordinated action by the international community, this damage is likely to accelerate in the future and further weaken global economic development. ” Mr. West estimated that the   shutdown last year in the Republic of Congo alone dealt an $72 million hit to the economy of the struggling nation. Cameroon’s continuing internet blackout affects only   regions of the country. It followed weeks of protests from lawyers, teachers and other residents in those areas who have been agitating for better treatment from the   government, which they say has long marginalized their communities. Before independence in the early 1960s, Cameroon was colonized by the French and the British. The Constitution allows protections for both languages, but Francophones rule the government. Most official documents are offered in French and not translated, evidence that Anglophones cite as proof of their marginalization. Some demonstrations in   areas have turned violent, and security forces have fired on protesters. The blackout has attracted attention from Edward J. Snowden, the former intelligence contractor who revealed extensive surveillance and data collection programs operated by the National Security Agency. He recently criticized Cameroon’s government on Twitter, saying, “This is the future of repression. ” A hashtag #BringBackOurInternet has been circulating. Yet the shutdown is a stopgap measure until another filtering system can get up and running, said one diplomat with knowledge of operations in the region, who declined to be identified because of continuing tensions there. The government is buying technology from Chinese companies that will allow officials to filter websites in the same fashion that the Chinese government has long employed to control content. Still, the blackout could have political ramifications for Cameroon’s government. Bankers have largely stayed apolitical over the more than three decades since President Paul Biya has been in office. But as the shutdown starts to hurt their business, they could become a potent adversary, analysts fear. The blockage has also made it difficult for local journalists to report on what is widely viewed as an overly harsh government response to the demonstrations. Before the internet went dark, some cellphone users received ominous messages from officials. “Dear subscriber,” one message the government circulated on WhatsApp warned. “You incur six months to two years imprisonment and 5 to 10 million fine if you publish or spread on the social media information that you can’t prove. ” Another message read, “Do not be an accomplice of disinformation or destabilization of our country through the social media. ” Some citizens in blackout areas have come up with clever ways to get around the shutdown. Cellphone users type out messages and then pay drivers who gather garbage bags full of phones and take them outside the blackout boundaries. After crossing into an area where the network is up and running, they hit the send button on each phone. Since the blackout, Henry Boh has not been able to send money to Bamenda in the northwest, where his brother needs cash to take his nephew to the hospital for treatment. “This is a clear sign that the government of Yaoundé doesn’t listen to its people’s voices,” said Mr. Boh, who lives in Yaoundé, the nation’s capital. Mr. Boh said the shutdown further proved the Anglophone protesters’ point that the government mistreated them. In the nation’s Far North region where Islamic militants from Boko Haram wage deadly attacks, they say, the internet is operational. “The government respects Boko Haram more than us,” Mr. Boh said.	1
262	FORDLÂNDIA, Brazil  —   The Amazon jungle already swallowed the Winding Brook Golf Course. Floods ravaged the cemetery, leaving behind a stockpile of concrete crosses. The   hospital designed by the acclaimed Detroit architect Albert Kahn? Plunderers destroyed it. Given the scale of decay and decrepitude in this town  —   founded in 1928 by the industrialist Henry Ford in the far reaches of the Amazon River Basin  —   I didn’t expect to come across the stately, largely   homes on Palm Avenue. But there they were, thanks to the squatters. “This street was a looters’ paradise, with thieves taking furniture, doorknobs, anything the Americans left behind,” said Expedito Duarte de Brito, 71, a retired milkman who dwells in one of the homes built for Ford managers in what was planned to be a utopian plantation town. “I thought, ‘Either I occupy this piece of history or it joins the other ruins of Fordlândia. ’” In more than a decade of reporting from Latin America, I made dozens of trips to the Amazon, lured back time and again by its vast rivers, magnificent skies, boomtowns, lost civilizations and tales of hubris consumed by nature. But somehow I never got to Fordlândia. That finally changed when I boarded a riverboat this year in Santarém, an outpost at the confluence of the Amazon and Tapajós rivers, and made the   trip to the place where Ford, one of the world’s richest men, tried turning a colossal swath of Brazilian jungle into a Midwest fantasyland. I explored the outpost on foot, wandering the ruins and talking to gold prospectors, farmers and descendants of plantation workers who live here. Hardly a lost city, Fordlândia is home to about 2, 000 people, some who live in the crumbling structures built nearly a century ago. Ford, the automobile manufacturer who is considered a founder of American industrial   methods, hatched his plan for Fordlândia in a bid to produce his own source of the rubber needed for making tires and car parts like valves, hoses and gaskets. In doing so, he waded into an industry shaped by imperialism and claims of botanical subterfuge. Brazil was home to Hevea brasiliensis, the coveted rubber tree, and the Amazon Basin had boomed from 1879 to 1912 as industries in North America and Europe fed the demand for rubber. But to the dismay of Brazil’s leaders, Henry Wickham, a British botanist and explorer, had spirited thousands of Hevea seeds out of Santarém, providing the genetic stock for rubber plantations in British, Dutch and French colonies in Asia. These endeavors on the other side of the world devastated Brazil’s rubber economy. But Ford despised relying on the Europeans, fearing a proposal by Winston Churchill to create a rubber cartel. So, in a move that pleased Brazilian officials, Ford acquired a giant stretch of land in the Amazon. From the start, ineptitude and tragedy plagued the venture, meticulously documented in a book by the historian Greg Grandin that I read on the boat as it made its way up the Tapajós. Disdainful of experts who could have advised them on tropical agriculture, Ford’s men planted seeds of questionable value and let leaf blight ravage the plantation. Despite such setbacks, Ford constructed an   town, which he wanted inhabited by Brazilians hewing to what he considered American values. Employees moved into clapboard bungalows  —   designed, of course, in Michigan  —   some of which are still standing. Streetlamps illuminated concrete sidewalks. Portions of these footpaths persist in the town, near red fire hydrants, in the shadow of decaying dance halls and crumbling warehouses. “It turns out Detroit isn’t the only place where Ford produced ruins,” said Guilherme Lisboa, 67, the owner of a small inn called the Pousada Americana. Beyond producing rubber, Ford, an avowed teetotaler,   and skeptic of the Jazz Age, clearly wanted life in the jungle to be more transformative. His American managers forbade consumption of alcohol, while promoting gardening, square dancing and readings of the poetry of Emerson and Longfellow. Going even further in Ford’s quest for utopia,   sanitation squads operated across the outpost, killing stray dogs, draining puddles of water where   mosquitoes could multiply and checking employees for venereal diseases. “With a surety of purpose and incuriosity about the world that seems all too familiar, Ford deliberately rejected expert advice and set out to turn the Amazon into the Midwest of his imagination,” Mr. Grandin, the historian, wrote in his account of the town. These days, the ruins of Fordlândia stand as testament to the folly of trying to bend the jungle to the will of man. Seeking to promote the automobile as a form of recreation  —   along with the golf course, tennis courts, a movie theater and swimming pools  —   managers laid out nearly 30 miles of roads around Fordlândia. But cars are mostly absent on the town’s muddy lanes, eclipsed by the motorbikes found in towns across the Amazon. By the end of World War II, it was clear that cultivating rubber trees around Fordlândia could not be profitable in the face of leaf blight and competition from synthetic rubber and Asian plantations freed from Japanese domination. After Ford turned the town over to Brazil’s government in 1945, officials transferred Fordlândia from one public agency to another, largely for unsuccessful experiments in tropical agriculture. The town went into a seemingly perpetual state of decline. “Nothing happens here, and that’s how I like it,” said Joaquim Pereira da Silva, 73, a farmer from Minas Gerais State who followed his star to Fordlândia in 1997. Now he lives on Palm Avenue in an old American house he bought for 20, 000 reais (about $6, 670) from a squatter who fixed it up. “The Americans had no idea about rubber but they knew how to build things to last,” he said. Something about the failed utopia strikes a chord with scholars and artists in other parts of the world. Fordlândia inspired a 2008 album by the Icelandic composer Johann Johannsson and a 1997 novel by Eduardo Sguiglia about an Argentine adventurer who travels here to recruit plantation laborers. Some descendants of workers who settled in Fordlândia, along with new migrants from other parts in Brazil, have small plots where zebu cattle graze. Others plant manioc in areas where rubber trees were chopped down decades ago. Many survive on small social welfare payments or pensions. Then there are residents like Eduardo Silva dos Santos, born 66 years ago in the hospital conceived by Kahn, the architect who designed much of   Detroit. Mr. dos Santos now lives in a small house near the hospital’s ruins. Scavenging material left by the Americans, he fashioned a fishing lantern from old car parts and a spice grinder from discarded machinery. Mr. dos Santos expressed mixed views of Fordlândia under American stewardship, growing up in the years after Ford unloaded the town. “This place in Ford’s day was clean, no insects, no animals, no jungle in the town,” said Mr. dos Santos, one of 11 children born to a family that depended on the rubber plantation. “My father worked for them,” he said, “and he did what they ordered him to do. Workers are like dogs: They obey. ” But to Ford’s dismay, sometimes they didn’t obey. Managers tried enforcing the alcohol prohibition, but workers simply hopped on boats to a   island of innocence nearby with bars and brothels. And in 1930, workers fed up with eating Ford’s diet of oatmeal, canned peaches and brown rice in a sweltering dining hall staged a   riot. They smashed time clocks, cut electricity to the plantation and chanted, “Brazil for Brazilians kill all the Americans,” forcing some of the managers to decamp into the jungle. The Amazon offered its own challenges to the Americans. Some couldn’t adapt to the conditions here, suffering nervous breakdowns. One drowned when a storm on the Tapajós River toppled his boat. Another manager left after three of his children died from tropical fevers. Ford might have avoided such tragedies, and the ruinous management of the plantation, if he had sought counsel from specialists in caring for rubber trees or scholars of the Amazon’s capacity to thwart grandiose ventures. But he seemed to abhor learning from the past. “History is bunk,” Ford told The New York Times in 1921. “What difference does it make how many times the ancient Greeks flew their kites?”	1

389	WASHINGTON  —   The father of the commando killed in a Special Operations raid in Yemen last month said in an interview published this weekend that he had refused to meet with President Trump on the day his son’s body was returned home, and criticized the White House over the mission, saying, “Don’t hide behind my son’s death to prevent an investigation. ” “The government owes my son an investigation,” the father, William Owens, told The Miami Herald, referring to Chief Petty Officer William Owens, 36, a member of the Navy’s SEAL Team 6. The death of Chief Owens on Jan. 29, in the first Special Operations raid approved by Mr. Trump, came after a chain of miscues and misjudgments that plunged the elite commandos into a ferocious   firefight with Qaeda militants in a mountainous village in central Yemen. Three other Americans were wounded, and a $75 million aircraft was deliberately destroyed. In a risky mission where almost everything that could go wrong did, the Pentagon has acknowledged that several civilians, including some children, were also killed. The dead included, by the account of relatives interviewed by human rights groups in Yemen, the    daughter of Anwar   the   Qaeda leader who was killed in a targeted drone strike in 2011. The mission’s casualties have raised doubts about the months of detailed planning that went into the operation, initially during the Obama administration, and whether the right questions were raised before its approval, which took place over a dinner Mr. Trump held with top advisers five days after taking office. Senior Trump administration officials said that the Defense Department had conducted a legal review of the mission and that a Pentagon lawyer had signed off on it. But the comments by Mr. Owens, his first public remarks since his son’s death, cast a new spotlight on whether the mission’s risks  —   to the American commandos and to Yemeni civilians  —   had been considered fully enough by Mr. Trump and his top aides. On Feb. 1, Mr. Trump flew to Dover Air Force Base in Delaware to be present as the body of Chief Owens, who was known as Ryan, was returned to the United States. His death was the first in the military on the new commander in chief’s watch. “I’m sorry I don’t want to see him,” Mr. Owens recalled telling a chaplain who had informed him that Mr. Trump was on his way from Washington. “I told them I don’t want to meet the president. ” “I told them I didn’t want to make a scene about it, but my conscience wouldn’t let me talk to him,” Mr. Owens said in the interview, which The Herald said took place on Friday at Mr. Owens’s home in    Sea, Fla. “Why at this time did there have to be this stupid mission when it wasn’t even barely a week into his administration? Why?” said Mr. Owens, who told The Herald that he had not voted for Mr. Trump. “For two years prior, there were no boots on the ground in Yemen  —   everything was missiles and drones  —   because there was not a target worth one American life. Now all of a sudden we had to make this grand display?” The operation was the first known   ground mission in Yemen since December 2014, when members of SEAL Team 6 stormed a village in southern Yemen in an effort to free an American photojournalist held hostage by Al Qaeda. That raid ended with the kidnappers killing the journalist and a South African held with him. Mr. Owens told the newspaper that he was a veteran himself, having served four years in the Navy before joining the Army Reserve in Illinois. Chief Owens’s two half brothers also served in the Navy, one as a member of the SEALs, according to The Herald. A woman who twice answered the phone at the Owens residence on Sunday and identified herself as Mr. Owens’s wife said he would not be making any statements beyond what he told The Herald. Shortly after the raid, Trump administration officials called the mission a success, saying that criticisms like those from Senator John McCain of Arizona, the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, who called the mission a failure, dishonored Chief Owens’s memory. “I know that the mission has a lot of different critics, but it did yield a substantial amount of very important intel and resources that helped save American lives and other lives,” Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the deputy White House press secretary, said on ABC’s “This Week” on Sunday. Pentagon officials, however, have declined to provide any specific examples of how the information on the cellphones, laptop computers and other materials recovered at the site would help track down terrorists. Officials have said it could take weeks or longer to fully analyze the materials. When asked if Mr. Trump would support an investigation into the circumstances surrounding Chief Owens’s death, Ms. Sanders said she had not spoken directly to the president about it but added, “I would imagine that he would be supportive of that. ” Col. John J. Thomas, a spokesman for the military’s Central Command in Tampa, Fla. which oversees operations in the Middle East, confirmed in an email on Sunday that the military was conducting an inquiry, as happens anytime there is an American casualty. “We take this very seriously, and we appreciate the deep desire to find out all we can about the tragic death of Ryan Owens during an operation against terrorists,” Colonel Thomas said. After initially denying that there had been any civilian casualties, Pentagon officials quickly backtracked after reports from the Yemeni authorities began trickling in and grisly photographs of children purportedly killed in the attack appeared on social media sites affiliated with Al Qaeda’s affiliate there. The Central Command has acknowledged the likelihood that civilians were killed in the crossfire, but Colonel Thomas offered no new information on the status of the military’s investigation into the allegations.	1

238	WASHINGTON  —   When Donald J. Trump first tried a few years ago to line up a speaking slot at the marquee event for the conservative grass roots, the Conservative Political Action Conference, the organizers almost rejected him because they thought he was a fraud who only wanted a platform to promote his hotels, casinos, neckties and golf courses. Stephen K. Bannon, then the head of Breitbart News, found himself essentially blacklisted from the gathering, known as CPAC. So he started a rival conference called The Uninvited and ran it out of a hotel down the street. With Mr. Trump now ensconced in the Oval Office and Mr. Bannon, his chief strategist, right down the hall, it is hardly in dispute who won the fight for control of the Republican Party. But there are still much bigger questions about whether Mr. Trump, who has never claimed to be a conservative but so far has governed conspicuously to the right, will ultimately be loyal to conservatives’ agenda. Mr. Trump does not dwell on policy, right or left. He prefers the transactional to the ideological. And for conservatives devoted to a cause that is fundamentally about ideas, the distance between the new president and the movement he overtook continues to loom as a red flag. That gap has been partly obscured by his first moves as president  —   trying to bar visitors from seven largely Muslim countries, scaling back Wall Street regulations, restricting federal funding that could go to abortion overseas and nominating a judge to the Supreme Court who is adored by conservatives. But some in the movement are unlikely ever to be totally at ease. And Mr. Trump may never fully be at ease with many of them. “With Trump, I do feel his instincts are conservative I do feel he understands the practical implications of an incompetent and inefficient government,” said Matt Schlapp, chairman of the American Conservative Union, which will convene CPAC starting on Wednesday. This time, Mr. Trump has been extended an invitation and is expected to speak. Still, with regard to conservatism, Mr. Schlapp added, “I’m not so sure he understands all the tenets and the philosophical background. ” Other Republican presidents have disappointed conservatives with major policy moves, from Dwight D. Eisenhower’s preservation of New Deal programs to Richard M. Nixon’s regulatory agenda to the elder George Bush’s reversal on his “no new taxes” pledge. But Mr. Trump, who considers himself the consummate deal maker, faces gnawing suspicions that he will find it easy to cut bargains that betray conservative principles. “I think it is safe to say that on the issues that are important to movement conservatives, the president’s actions since the inauguration have significantly reduced concerns by conservatives,” said Morton Blackwell, a longtime conservative activist who served as Ronald Reagan’s liaison to conservative activists and met with Mr. Trump at the White House this month. Still, Mr. Blackwell added, “there are significant numbers of people who are concerned. ” What makes some especially wary of Mr. Trump, said Grover Norquist, the veteran   activist and conservative leader, is how uninterested the president seems in their ideas. “They don’t think he’d ever read their novel, their policy paper, their magazine article  —   or even listen to them for more than five minutes,” he said. Republicans remain traumatized by presidents they believe governed too far to the left despite promises to do the opposite. “They’re used to sending senators, governors, congressmen into Washington and instead of seeing a sewer, they see a hot tub that they want to jump in,” Mr. Norquist said. Mr. Trump has, however, given conservatives plenty of reasons to temper their concerns. Beyond the nomination of Judge Neil M. Gorsuch to the Supreme Court and the flurry of executive orders, he has assembled a cabinet that the American Conservative Union deemed the most conservative of any Republican president, based on ratings given to the appointees who were members of Congress. The group scores lawmakers on a    scale of conservatism. And the six House members and senators Mr. Trump has selected for his cabinet were among the most conservative on Capitol Hill, earning an average score of 90. 6. “I’m seeing a pattern,” Mr. Schlapp said, “where I can more comfortably say he’s governing like a conservative. ” But many of the biggest items on the conservative checklist remain in flux  —   the repeal and replacement of the Affordable Care Act and an overhaul of the tax code being chief among them. And it remains in doubt whether Mr. Trump, whose White House has ricocheted from one distraction to the next in its first few weeks, will retain enough credibility with lawmakers to accomplish those goals. “I think now the question is: Can we get a lot of this stuff done?” said William Kristol, a frequent Trump critic and editor at large of The Weekly Standard. The risk for conservative policy, he said, is that the circuslike atmosphere around the White House will end up shattering Mr. Trump’s relationship with Republican lawmakers. “And if it really is a circus, you don’t want to be just another clown inside the tent,” Mr. Kristol added. One reason that some conservatives believe Mr. Trump’s support from the movement and its loyal lawmakers is so fragile is that it has been predicated on the sugar high of an election everyone told them they could not win against an opponent they loathed. “I think the majority of conservatives celebrating his victory were really celebrating Hillary’s defeat,” said Al Cardenas, a former chairman of the American Conservative Union. “And he was the conduit for that defeat. ” There are also serious policy questions that trouble conservatives, foremost among them what might happen to the federal deficit if Mr. Trump embarks on a plan to spend $1 trillion on revamping the nation’s infrastructure  —   a deal that many Democrats are eager to strike with him. That is where Mr. Trump’s brand of transactional politics could become a liability. “That was sort of the point of view of the tentative Trump supporters  —   you can do transactional politics with them,” said Rich Lowry, the editor of National Review. But the conservatives are hardly guaranteed to come out on the winning end of the transaction every time.	1
438	LOS ANGELES  —   Will Oscar take “Moonlight” to the bank? When the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences named “Moonlight” best picture on Sunday, the organization made cultural history, and not just for the bonkers way the victory was announced. For the first time, Hollywood backed a   film  —   one with an   cast  —   as its finest cinematic work. Now the pressure is on A24, the relatively new studio behind “Moonlight,” to use that achievement to fill theater seats. A24 said on Tuesday that it had booked “Moonlight” into at least 1, 500 theaters in the United States for the coming weekend. That would be the film’s widest release by far. While “Moonlight” has been chugging along in theaters for 20 weeks now  —   a feat unto itself that speaks to A24’s nurturing  —   it has so far played in a maximum of 1, 104 locations, a relatively small footprint. By comparison, “La La Land” played 3, 236 theaters at its widest point. The question is whether the best picture designation and the enormous media attention generated by the Oscars ceremony will convince mainstream ticket buyers who have not yet supported “Moonlight” to take a gander. Despite its long run, “Moonlight,” which also won Oscars for its screenplay and for Mahershala Ali’s acting, has taken in only $22. 1 million at domestic theaters, held back by its subject matter, lack of star power and novelistic structure. Ticket sales so far for “Moonlight” are the second lowest on record for a best picture winner, according to comScore, which compiles ticketing data. “The Hurt Locker,” which took in $17 million in 2009, or $19 million after adjusting for inflation, is the lowest. (“Moonlight” only cost $1. 5 million to make. “The Hurt Locker” cost $15 million.) A24 declined to comment for this article. The   Oscar Bump at the box office varies widely. Some films have already concluded their theatrical runs and receive nothing. In other instances, the effect can be substantial. According to comScore, the previous three   winners  —   “Spotlight,” “Birdman,” “12 Years a Slave”  —   each generated 10 percent or more of their total domestic grosses after their victories. For winners that are seen as especially arty, the boost can be even bigger. “The Artist,” a    largely silent film that was named best picture in 2012, collected 29 percent of its total gross after that year’s Oscar ceremony. A24, which was founded in 2012 and focuses on      movies, has gained a reputation as one of the savvier specialty film distributors in Hollywood. In the case of “Moonlight,” directed and   by Barry Jenkins, A24 first released the film in   in only four theaters in New York and Los Angeles to begin building word of mouth. The company then began testing demand in theaters in cities like Atlanta and Washington that drew a   of mainstream and specialty film ticket buyers, many of them  . In the film’s 13th weekend  —   using the Golden Globes as a peg  —   A24 pushed “Moonlight” from 135 theaters to 582. But demand was soft in spots: In most areas of the country, the multiplex crowd was not yet on board. Only after the Oscar nominations (“Moonlight” received eight) did the film manage to cross the   mark. (It was released on DVD on Tuesday.) “A24 has done a fantastic job of nurturing and protecting this film,” said Daniel Loria, editorial director of Box Office Media. “To pay sustained attention to   runs over the course of months, that takes real commitment. ”	1
327	WASHINGTON  —   Two days before Election Day, Donald J. Trump traveled to Sioux City, Iowa, and proclaimed that he was the protector of federal programs aimed at helping elderly and   Americans. It was Hillary Clinton, he said, who was an untrustworthy steward of the working class and who would slash vital benefits. “I am going to protect and save your Social Security and your Medicare,” Mr. Trump said. “You made a deal a long time ago, a long time ago. ” The pledge followed earlier promises to enact a new    benefit and not to make cuts to Medicaid, the health insurance program for the poor. When President Trump addresses Congress this Tuesday and follows the speech with a budget blueprint for the fiscal year that begins in October, his White House will finally address in concrete numbers one of his central contradictions: He campaigned as the populist protector of programs for the working class, yet he has pledged to control the budget deficit, cut spending and cut taxes. Moreover, Mr. Trump has surrounded himself with traditional   conservatives bent on cutting back or eliminating many of the programs he has championed. Many of his aides and cabinet members have expressed views that are fundamentally opposed to those he campaigned on. Former Representative Mick Mulvaney of South Carolina, for example, the new White House budget director, has called Social Security a “Ponzi scheme” and helped engineer a government shutdown to cut spending. As House Budget Committee chairman, Tom Price, the new secretary of health and human services, supported converting Medicaid to strictly capped block grants to the states and turning Medicare into a voucherlike program for future recipients. Ben Carson, the president’s nominee to head the Department of Housing and Urban Development, has repeatedly said government programs to help the poor lead to dependency. The disparity between Mr. Trump’s rhetoric and his appointments has cheered many Republicans and left Democrats fearing that he will not only renege on his promises to protect the government’s largest entitlement programs but that he will also slash programs he did not mention on the campaign trail that offer food, housing and child care support for the poor. “The appointments that he’s made are troublesome and very, very scary,” Senator Al Franken, Democrat of Minnesota, said. “He made a pledge and sort of delineated himself from the rest of the Republican field by saying these things. Everything he’s done since he’s been elected is very worrisome. ” Already, Mr. Trump’s budget office has hinted at cuts to come in a memo that singled out the Legal Services Corporation, which helps the poor manage legal issues, and the Appalachian Regional Commission, which targets economic development in some of the poorest parts of the country. The memo also said that AmeriCorps, a program that puts volunteers into poor communities, would be zeroed out, and that the Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation, a nonprofit organization focused on urban development, would see its budget cut substantially. On Capitol Hill, some Republicans are hoping Mr. Mulvaney and others will change the president’s mind on far bigger targets and convince him that structural changes to Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid  —   the biggest drivers of deficits that are projected to rise over the next decade  —   are needed to control the national debt and to preserve the programs without substantial tax increases. Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid consumed nearly $1. 9 trillion of the government’s $3. 9 trillion in spending in 2016, according to the Congressional Budget Office, and with the number of people 65 and over projected to rise by a third over the next decade, Social Security and Medicare spending is projected to increase from a third of all spending in 2017 to 42 percent by 2027. Including Medicaid and military and federal civilian retirement benefits, federal spending on older adults will rise from 37 percent of outlays in 2017 to 45 percent in 2027 if nothing is done to change the programs. Even some liberal economists say that will amount to a transfer of funds from poor children and families toward   older Americans, because the budget office projects that discretionary spending  —   where most programs for poor families come from  —   will be squeezed from 6. 3 percent of the economy now to 5. 3 percent in 2027, the smallest level since 1962. With those numbers on their side, Republicans are most likely to use their power in both the executive and legislative branches to push through large cuts to federal programs for poor and   Americans, say Democrats and liberal policy analysts  —   if Mr. Trump eases up on his promises. “This is the greatest threat to   people in my lifetime,” said Olivia Golden, executive director of the Center for Law and Social Policy, a nonprofit organization focused on   Americans. House Republican allies see no real contradiction in Mr. Trump’s campaign promises and what they say he must now do. Since President George W. Bush’s failed 2005 effort to partially privatize Social Security, Republicans have assured retirees and those nearing retirement that any changes or cuts to entitlement programs for older adults would not affect them. Now, Republicans are retroactively applying those caveats to Mr. Trump’s promises, saying the president understands that programs like Social Security and Medicare must be maintained for Americans who are currently receiving benefits but must be changed for younger Americans who may have to work longer before retiring and getting benefits. “It was really about making sure that those people who are getting benefits or about to get benefits are protected,” said Representative Mark Meadows, Republican of North Carolina and a leader of the   conservative House Freedom Caucus. “If we do nothing, he will not save Medicare and Social Security. ” Representative Jeff Duncan, Republican of South Carolina, said he would be closely watching his former Freedom Caucus colleague, Mr. Mulvaney, as he settles in to work at the Office of Management and Budget. “I’m curious to see how Mick Mulvaney approaches this from O. M. B. because he is very   with us here,” Mr. Duncan said. In fact, on the campaign trail and in interviews before the election, Mr. Trump did not suggest that he would maintain the programs in their current form only for older Americans. His rallies were attended by a   of ages, who cheered his broad promises. And last March, Mr. Trump said during a debate among Republican presidential candidates that he planned to make no changes. “I will do everything within my power not to touch Social Security, to leave it the way it is,” Mr. Trump said. “I want to leave Social Security as is, I want to make our country rich again so we can afford it. ” The pressure to break that promise will come not only from congressional Republicans but also from his own campaign pledges to build a wall along the Mexican border, increase spending on defense, border security and infrastructure, cut taxes “big league” and control the deficit. “The last time we saw this kind of budgetary logic was at the beginning of the Reagan administration when he came into office, pledged to beef up defense spending and cut taxes,” said William A. Galston, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and a former aide to President Bill Clinton. “They tried to keep the spending increases down and the deficit increases down by whacking away at social safety net programs, many of which were cut during that period. ” Even if Mr. Trump keeps his promise not to touch Social Security and Medicare, other programs like housing subsidies, child care assistance, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, also known as food stamps, could be cut, social welfare and budget analysts say. And those cuts would not just affect poor minority voters, who tend to support Democratic candidates. A study released this month by the   Center on Budget and Policy Priorities research group shows that white   adults without a college degree, a critical voting block for Republicans, benefit the most from social safety net programs and   benefits. “My fear is that we are going to see the biggest cuts that any president has ever proposed in programs for   and   families,” said Bob Greenstein, the center’s president. “It could be the biggest Robin Hood in reverse a president has ever offered. ”	1
118	Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the  .) With thousands of people fleeing areas downstream from Lake Oroville amid warnings of catastrophic danger, my editor thought it would be a good idea for me to do the opposite. So early Monday, I drove from my   home to Oroville, about 80 miles north in the Sierra Nevada foothills. Along Route 70, Northern California’s extreme wet winter was evident in every direction. It was reflected in the flooded orchards, the bursting Yuba River and the Sierra’s snowy peaks. Relentless runoff from the mountains had caused Lake Oroville to flow over its emergency spillway for the first time ever on Saturday. A day later, state officials noticed a hole forming in the spillway and prepared for the worst, ordering nearly 190, 000 people to seek safer ground. In Oroville on Monday, just a handful of businesses were open. Among them was Mike’s Grande Burger which gave out free meals to the truck drivers, emergency personnel and others working at the hobbled spillway. Some residents who had stayed behind gathered on a hill above Oroville Dam and watched the scene below. The reservoir, California’s second largest, was perfectly still and surrounded by   hills. In the distance, the   Feather River snaked along the valley floor. Locals recalled flooding events of the past  —   one in 1997, when thousands of people were forced to flee, and another in 2006. Some wondered whether state officials had done enough to shore up the Oroville reservoir before the latest round of trouble. Others talked about untamable nature. With more storms approaching, officials are effectively now in a race against time to lower the level of the lake and reinforce the hobbled spillway. Whether it will be enough is by no means certain.

401	Few actresses are more likable than Emma Stone. She is spunky, talented,   and slightly goofy. But unlike some approachable actresses, who stick with the pretty if bland aesthetic, Ms. Stone is as soignée as they come. “She’s very spirited when it comes to fashion,” said Petra Flannery, her stylist for the past decade. “She’s a very animated person, and my goal is to make the clothes complement all of that, whether it’s through color, or a material that makes it unique, or an interesting design. ” It helps that like the variety of characters she inhabits  —   Ms. Stone is nominated for an Oscar in the best actress category for the   musical film “La La Land”  —   she has range. She comes alive in marigold (a flirty,   Gucci creation at a W magazine party last month, which Ms. Flannery called “the ultimate party dress”) sky blue (a   Prada dress at the Los Angeles “La La Land” premiere in December) and even pale sea foam (a shimmering Atelier Versace gown at the Venice Film Festival in September, which seemed to have gone through a very expensive shredder). Strange proportions are also fair game. At the EE British Academy Film Awards, familiarly known as the Baftas, this month, Ms. Stone managed to make a   embroidered smoke gray organza dress over    pants (Chanel haute couture, mind you) seem like kismet. “The look was so cool because of the pants, but also it was a little Lucille Ball because of the ’50s shape of the dress,” Ms. Flannery said. It was not the first time Ms. Stone carried off a tricky Chanel design  —   or pants on the red carpet, for that matter. While an ornate embroidered jacket and a heavy silver and gold column skirt, both in tweed, might have sapped the youth out of some, Ms. Stone was a sophisticated jeune fille in the Chanel Métiers d’Art outfit she wore to the Paris premiere of “La La Land. ” Yet Ms. Stone doesn’t overdose on opulence. Like a palate cleanser, the actress peppered her red carpet look with minimal slip dresses (a rich burgundy number by the Row for the London premiere of “La La Land” in January and a strappy black Stella McCartney design at the Santa Barbara International Film Festival this month). Another Stella McCartney, a midnight blue jumpsuit worn to the Oscar Nominees Luncheon a few days later, was also relatively spare, though the puffed   cut had plenty of quirk. “I always want to keep it fresh and fun,” Ms. Flannery said. To that end, she works with a combination of custom and runway pieces. “I love doing custom, because it’s nice to know you’re really surprising people,” she said, pointing to the glittering   Valentino gown Ms. Stone wore to the Golden Globes last month. Sourcing directly from the runway used to be the gold standard, but, Ms. Flannery said, “it’s different today with social media. ” “Instagram images pop up all over,” she continued, “and by the time a dress comes from the runway, it can feel like you’ve seen it already. ” Luckily, Ms. Flannery has such access  —   Ms. Stone, after all, is a red carpet score for any designer  —   that she can nab a collection piece before it has ever left the studio. Such was the case when she secured the remarkable Alexander McQueen dress with lily pad embroidery that Ms. Stone wore to the Screen Actors Guild Awards in January. With asymmetrical draping and a lace bodice, the design was a visual feat: Ms. Stone looked as though she was partially undressed. Ms. Flannery said the gown was from the label’s 2017   collection, which “had not been viewed by anybody yet. ” She reserved the piece a couple of weeks before the awards ceremony as she was passing through London with Ms. Stone. “It’s true designers love her,” Ms. Flannery said, “but also Emma appreciates fashion from an artist’s point of view. Style is innate. It’s in her bones. ”	1
218	This was supposed to be America’s nuclear century. The Three Mile Island meltdown was two generations ago. Since then, engineers had developed innovative designs to avoid the kinds of failures that devastated Fukushima in Japan. The United States government was earmarking billions of dollars for a new atomic age, in part to help tame a warming global climate. But a remarkable confluence of events is bringing that to an end, capped in recent days by Toshiba’s decision to take a $6 billion loss and pull Westinghouse, its American nuclear power subsidiary, out of the construction business. The reasons are  . Against expectations, demand for electricity has slowed.   prices have tumbled, eroding nuclear power’s economic rationale.   sources like wind and solar power have come into their own. And, perhaps most significantly, attempts to square two   forces  —   the desire for greater safety, and the need to contain costs  —   while bringing to life complex new designs have blocked or delayed nearly all of the projects planned in the United States. “You can make it go fast, and you can make it be cheap  —   but not if you adhere to the standard of care that we do,” said Mark Cooper of the Institute for Energy and the Environment at Vermont Law School, referring to the United States regulatory body, which is considered one of the most meticulous in the world. “Nuclear safety always undermines nuclear economics. Inherently, it’s a technology whose time never comes. ” In the process, the United States could lose considerable influence over standards governing safety and waste management, nuclear experts say. And the world may show less willingness to move toward potentially safer designs. “I’m concerned that if the U. S. is not seen as a big player, and doesn’t have that kind of market presence, that we won’t be in a competitive position to bring those standards back up,” said Richard Nephew, a senior research scholar at the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia. “If you’ve got more lax safety standards worldwide, I think that’s a problem from an industry perspective as well as just a human standard. ” This may be an advantage for   nuclear industries worldwide. Often they benefit from   national policies in places like Eastern Europe, Asia and the Middle East. By contrast, the   withdrawal from nuclear construction shows how daunting it can be for the private sector to build these plants, even with generous government subsidies like loan guarantees and tax credits. Projects take decades to complete. Safety concerns change along the way, leading to new regulations, thousands of design alterations, delays and spiraling costs for every element. In one case, even the dirt used to backfill excavated holes at the Westinghouse project in Georgia became a point of contention when it did not measure up to Nuclear Regulatory Commission standards, leading to increased costs and a lawsuit. Thus far in the United States, only the Tennessee Valley Authority, itself a government corporation, has been able to bring a new nuclear reactor into operation in the last 20 years. Of the dozens of new reactors once up for licensing with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, only four are actively under construction. Two are at the Alvin W. Vogtle generating station in Georgia, and two at the Virgil C. Summer plant in South Carolina. Both projects, which plan to use a novel reactor from Westinghouse, have been plagued by delays and cost overruns, some stemming, paradoxically, from an untested regulatory system intended to simplify and accelerate their development. The projects, more than three years late and billions over budget, are what pushed Westinghouse  —   one of the last private companies building nuclear reactors  —   and its parent, Toshiba, to the brink of financial ruin, resulting in Toshiba’s chairman stepping down. The company has said that Westinghouse will complete the reactors for the projects it already has underway, including two in China. But the fate of other projects in the United States and abroad that plan to use the Westinghouse reactor, known as the AP1000, are in doubt, along with the role of the United States in the future of nuclear energy. It is also unclear how President Trump will approach nuclear energy development, which has broad and overlapping implications for tax and trade policies, economic development and national security. The AP1000 is considered one of the world’s most advanced reactors, with simplified structures and safety equipment which were intended to make it easier and less expensive to install, operate and maintain. It has been designed with an improved ability to withstand earthquakes and plane crashes and is less vulnerable to a cutoff of electricity, which is what set off the triple meltdown at Fukushima. The industry has lurched through boom and bust cycles before. Nuclear construction had all but disappeared in the United States, particularly after the partial meltdown at Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania in 1979. Concerns over climate change led to renewed interest in building new plants under the administration of George W. Bush, however. The   energy policy acts authorized $18. 5 billion in loan guarantees, plus tax credits like those available for wind and solar. Determined to avoid the delays and ballooning costs that were common as plants were built in the 1970s and ’80s, federal regulators had devised a new licensing process. Under the old system, companies received construction permits based on incomplete plans and then applied for an operating license, often leading to rebuilding and lengthy delays. The idea for the new system was that companies would submit much more complete design plans for approval, and then receive their operating licenses as construction started. That way, as long as they built exactly what they said they would, the process could move more quickly. In the meantime, companies like Westinghouse and General Electric were developing a new generation of reactors intended to operate more safely. With the AP1000, for instance, emergency cooling for the reactor mainly relies on natural forces, like gravity, to propel the coolant, rather than relying on mechanical pumps powered by electricity. The problem is that electricity can fail, as it did at Fukushima, which can lead to disastrous overheating in a damaged reactor of an older design. In addition, Westinghouse was engineering its equipment so that large components of the plants could be made in sections at factories, then welded together and lifted into place with cranes at the construction site. In theory, this approach would save money and time, requiring far less skilled labor than the old, bespoke approach, in which workers assembled more parts onsite. By 2008, Westinghouse had deals to expand two existing plants with the electric utilities Georgia Power and South Carolina Electric  Gas. Little went as hoped. Because nuclear construction had been dormant for so long, American companies lacked the equipment and expertise needed to make some of the biggest components, like the   reactor vessels. Instead, they were manufactured overseas, adding to expense and delays. One reactor vessel, headed for Georgia Power’s Vogtle plant from the Port of Savannah, almost slipped off a specialized rail car. That led to a weekslong delay before a second attempt was made to deliver it. And, in a separate snafu, while working on the plant’s basement contractors installed 1, 200 tons of steel reinforcing bar in a way that differed from the approved design. That triggered a     month delay to get a license amendment. To some extent, the unexpected delays were to be, well, expected, given the novelty of the design and the fact that builders were decades out of practice. Any large undertaking involving so many     complexities would be likely get tripped up somewhere, said Daniel S. Lipman, vice president of supplier and international programs at the Nuclear Energy Institute, which represents the industry. “Whether you’re building a nuclear power plant or providing a new locomotive or a new fighter jet complex for the Defense Department, the first of a kind almost always takes longer to be deployed,” he said. And then there was Fukushima, when an earthquake and tsunami knocked out both grid and backup emergency power at the plant, disabling its cooling systems and leading to the meltdown of three reactors. The plant remains shut down, and the decommissioning and cleanup process is projected to take as long as 40 years. The Japan disaster prompted regulators to revisit safety standards, slowing approval of the Westinghouse designs and resulting in new requirements even after the Nuclear Regulatory Commission gave the   for the Georgia and South Carolina projects. That led to more costly delays as manufacturing orders had to be changed. As all of that unfolded, Westinghouse was having troubles with the contractor it chose to complete the projects, a company that struggled to meet the strict demands of nuclear construction and was undergoing its own internal difficulties after a merger. As part of an effort to get the delays and escalating costs under control, Westinghouse acquired part of the construction company, which set off a series of   disputes over who should absorb the cost overruns and how Westinghouse accounted for and reported values in the transaction. Toshiba, which would like to sell all or part of its controlling interest in Westinghouse, has said it will continue to look into Westinghouse’s handling of the purchase. “Certainly they underestimated the amount of liability or cost overruns that these projects were in,” Robert Norfleet, a managing director at Alembic Global Advisors who has followed the machinations, said of Westinghouse. “I don’t really know how they can’t take the blame for that. That’s something within their own due diligence that they needed to do. ” In the meantime, the main stage for nuclear development will move overseas to places like China, Russia, India, Korea and a handful of countries in the Middle East, where Westinghouse will have to find partners to build its designs. In China, plants using an earlier model of the AP1000 are moving toward completion. If they are successful, that may stir up more interest in the technology, and future installations may go more smoothly. But Toshiba’s ambitions of installing 45 new reactors worldwide by 2030 no longer look feasible. Indeed, despite the   ingenuity of a new generation of reactors designed by the likes of Westinghouse and G. E. countries may stick with older technologies that they can produce and install more quickly and cheaply. “Until several of these new designs  —   including the AP1000 from Westinghouse  —   come online on time and on budget,” said Brent Wanner, an analyst at the International Energy Agency, “it will be an uphill battle. ”	1
32	PARIS  —   A French farmer who smuggled African migrants to safety, defying the authorities in an effort that his supporters likened to the Underground Railroad, was essentially given a slap on the wrist by a court on Friday. The farmer, Cédric Herrou, a bearded olive grower, has become something of a hero after he shepherded migrants across the Italian border and into the Roya Valley of southern France, challenging official policy of rounding up migrants and sending them to detention centers or deporting them. A court in Nice ordered Mr. Herrou on Friday to pay a fine of 3, 000 euros, or about $3, 200. If he stays out of trouble for five years, he will not have to pay it. The light sentence  —   almost a nonsentence, given that the prosecutor,   Prêtre, had asked for a tougher punishment  —   was an indication of how politically delicate the case against Mr. Herrou had become. He had popular opinion largely on his side  —   a fact the judges appeared to acknowledge in essentially letting him go with a warning. At the end of a highly publicized trial last month, Mr. Prêtre had requested that Mr. Herrou, 37, be given a suspended   prison term. A 2012 law allows citizens to help migrants for humanitarian reasons. Before that legislation, such aid could result in a sentence of up to five years and a fine of up to €30, 000. But Mr. Prêtre said that Mr. Herrou’s actions had gone beyond the scope of the law, helping migrants enter the country illegally instead of merely offering them shelter. Last month, the readers of the newspaper   chose Mr. Herrou as “Azuréen of the Year,” a reference to people from the Côte d’Azur. At the trial, Mr. Prêtre appeared contrite at times that the law had to be applied to Mr. Herrou, whose cause he praised as “noble. ” Mr. Herrou was cleared on Friday of the more severe charges of having helped illegal migrants stay on French territory and of having illegally hosted more than 50 Eritreans in an abandoned holiday resort. Agence   reported that Mr. Herrou had welcomed the decision in an address to a small crowd of supporters in front of the courthouse. “We’ll carry on, because it’s necessary,” he told the crowd, according to the news agency. Mr. Herrou told Europe 1 radio Friday morning that he is sheltering five migrant minors from Sudan and Eritrea at his home. “There’s a deficiency of the state in France and in Italy, so I take action,” he said. Mr. Herrou is not the only person to have appeared in court for illegally assisting migrants. Last month,   Mannoni, a researcher, was acquitted by the same court in Nice of having offered a ride to migrants. Border control has become a defining political issue in France in light of repeated terrorist attacks.	1
207	LONDON  —   When Ecuador holds a general election on Sunday, the results could have international repercussions linked to one man thousands of miles away: Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, who took refuge in the country’s embassy in London nearly five years ago and who remains there. Mr. Assange moved into the embassy in Knightsbridge, one of the British capital’s most affluent neighborhoods, after accusations of rape in Sweden, which he has described as a   for an American effort to extradite him and try him on espionage charges. Whether Ecuador will continue its role of reluctant warden to Mr. Assange, who was granted asylum by President Rafael Correa in 2012, hinges on the outcome of the elections. Eight candidates are seeking the presidency, and at least two have said they would evict him if they won. If balloting reflects recent poll results, it is unlikely that Mr. Assange would need to pack his bags anytime soon: While Mr. Correa’s preferred successor, Lenín Moreno, is the   polls indicate that the election is likely to go to a second round, meaning that Mr. Assange’s fate may not be decided until a runoff in early April. If Guillermo Lasso of Creating Opportunities or Cynthia Viteri of the Social Christian Party pull off an upset, however, it could be a different fate altogether. “As president of this nation, I need the money used for his upkeep, for example to pay for my children’s school lunches,” Ms. Viteri said about Mr. Assange,  the newspaper El Comercio reported on Thursday. “I withdraw his asylum,” she said, “for the purchase, in my opinion, of Mr. Assange’s silence. ” She did not elaborate. Ms. Viteri was a distant third in two recent polls, with about 14 percent of support. In the past, Mr. Lasso has supported Mr. Assange’s stay at the embassy, but he expressed a different view in comments to The Guardian last week. “The Ecuadorean people have been paying a cost that we should not have to bear,” he said. “We will cordially ask Señor Assange to leave within 30 days of assuming a mandate. ” Foreign Minister Guillaume Long has rejected the idea that Mr. Assange might be forced to leave the embassy. “We’ve ratified his asylum several times, and under this government, there is no decision to revoke it at all,” he said in an interview on Friday. “Let’s not forget that Julian Assange was granted asylum on grounds of fear of possible political persecution. ” Mr. Moreno, the   did not make much of the issue of Mr. Assange’s fate during the campaign, which has focused on economic matters at a time of falling oil prices. Speculation that Mr. Assange was overstaying his welcome grew when the embassy cut off his access to the internet in October, shortly before elections in the United States. WikiLeaks had published tens of thousands of hacked emails from inside Hillary Clinton’s campaign and the Democratic National Committee. “We didn’t want any ambiguity,” Mr. Long said of his country’s decision to cut off Mr. Assange’s online access. “We wanted it to be very clear that Ecuador’s diplomatic mission was not being used in order to interfere in the U. S. electoral process. ” Mr. Long said that Mr. Assange, whom he last saw in June, lived in “extremely tough conditions,” in a small space with very little light. “London is not exactly the most luminous city, and it has a long winter,” he said. The foreign minister revealed some weariness with the length of Mr. Assange’s time at the embassy, The Guardian reported, asking for Sweden to speed up its investigation as “this has been going on for far too long. ” But in the interview on Friday, he dismissed the idea that providing refuge to Mr. Assange came at a financial cost that Ecuadoreans could not afford. Rather, he said, the cost is political. “We’ve taken a principled decision, and it speaks highly of a country that defends its ideals, not just petty interests,” he said. “Having one more person in the embassy is a marginal addition to the cost of running the embassy,” he continued. “What’s the cost of having someone in the bedroom?”	1

303	Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the  .) California appeared to witness a rise in hate last year. In 2016, the state was home to 79 organizations with animus toward blacks, whites, immigrants, Muslims and other groups, according to a new report by the Southern Poverty Law Center, an   group that tracks extremism. That’s up from 68 the year before. The report found that California had more hate groups than any other state  —   followed by Florida, with 63, and Texas, 55  —   a result presumably of its sheer size. But the data also revealed a notable cluster of activity in the corridor between the Los Angeles area and San Diego, where at least 40 of the groups operate. Mark Potok, a senior fellow at the center, suggested the presence of a heavy Latino population in Southern California played a part in fueling   sentiment. To earn a place in the hate index, an organization must publicly espouse the idea that a class of people is inferior by virtue of its characteristics. The   Southern Poverty Law Center, founded in 1971, has faced criticism in the past for applying the designation to mainstream conservative groups, such as the Family Research Council. In 2015, it apologized after labeling Ben Carson an “extremist. ” The latest report included many California groups, such as the Golden State Skinheads, Identity Evropa and Islam Threat, whose platforms are explicitly discriminatory. But the classification of other groups drew pushback. Californians for Population Stabilization, a Santa Barbara group with thousands of members, was labeled   by the center. Mr. Potok attributed the determination in part to troubling remarks about race and eugenics made by people formerly linked to the group. Benjamin Zuckerman, the group’s president, vehemently objected to the characterization. The organization’s objectives, he said, are twofold: environmental conservation and fairness to working Americans who are harmed by “over immigration. ” “I consider us pretty much just ordinary people,” said Dr. Zuckerman, who is also an astronomy professor at U. C. L. A. “We just have a view that too many people for a given environmental carrying capacity is just not good. ” (Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.) • Nearly 250 people were rescued from flooding in San Jose after rain combined with water from the overflowing Anderson Reservoir.

359	A month after President Trump’s executive order barring people from seven   nations from entering the United States caused tumult around the country, the government’s accounting of how many travelers the ban affected remains unclear. A total of 746 people were detained and processed in a   period immediately after a federal judge in Brooklyn blocked part of Mr. Trump’s Jan. 27 order, according to a list released by the government on Thursday. The figure was nearly seven times greater than the 109 people that Mr. Trump said in a Jan. 30 message on Twitter had been “held for questioning” and Sean M. Spicer, the White House press secretary, said had been “inconvenienced. ” But, according to lawyers for some of those who were detained, 746 may be an incomplete figure. At a hearing before Judge Carol B. Amon of Federal District Court in Brooklyn on Friday, those lawyers challenged the veracity of the government’s list, saying they knew of at least 10 people who had been detained who were not included in the tally. Some detainees were forced to return to the countries from which they had come, despite having valid visas. The lawyers initially asked that the government provide them with a list of names so they could help people return to the United States. Joshua Press, a Justice Department trial lawyer, said at the hearing that a vast majority of those who were held were eventually allowed to enter the country and were legal permanent residents. He said he could not provide a specific number. The Justice Department referred a request for that figure to the Customs and Border Protection agency, which declined to comment because of the continuing litigation. At the hearing, Judge Amon ordered the government to inform the plaintiffs how many of the 746 people on the government’s list had been allowed to enter the country, and to investigate the cases the plaintiffs’ lawyers said had been omitted. The list included only the given name and surname of those who were detained and did not mention nationalities. Judge Amon had not ordered that contact information be included. “All we’re trying to do is put together a puzzle, to which the government has all the pieces,” said Muneer I. Ahmad, one of the lawyers for the plaintiffs. When Mr. Ahmad questioned why the people he and his colleagues cited were missing from the list, Mr. Press replied, “The government is not omniscient. ” Mr. Trump’s executive order was halted on Feb. 9 by the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in San Francisco, which upheld a ruling by a federal judge in Seattle. The Trump administration has said it plans to issue a revised order next week. Judge Ann M. Donnelly of Federal District Court in Brooklyn originally issued a stay of removal on Jan. 28 just before 9 p. m. At the time, she also ordered the government to provide a list of those people detained as a result of the executive order. The case was later assigned to Judge Amon. On Tuesday, she clarified in an order that a “snapshot” to measure how many people had been detained should include those held immediately after Judge Donnelly’s ruling, from 9:37 p. m. on Jan. 28 until 11:59 p. m. on Jan. 29. The list provided by the government did not include refugees because they generally do not arrive on weekends, said Rebecca Heller, a lawyer with the International Refugee Assistance Project. According to documents submitted to the court by the American Civil Liberties Union, some of those detained described having their phones confiscated, their requests to talk to lawyers denied and, in some cases, being coerced into signing forms that resulted in their deportation. Sara Yarjani, an Iranian citizen who is studying for a master’s degree in holistic health in California, was held for 23 hours at Los Angeles International Airport before being deported, after Judge Donnelly issued her ruling, according to court filings. Suha Amin Abdullah Abushamma, a Sudanese doctor at the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio who was born in Saudi Arabia and has a valid work visa, was detained at Kennedy Airport for 10 hours and deported, according to the filings. There is an urgent need to find those on the government’s list of people who were held, said Lee Gelernt, lead lawyer with the A. C. L. U. for detainees. He said he feared that those people might be forgotten once the Trump administration releases new travel restrictions. “We’re going to do our best to get everybody back, and then we’ll fight the new executive order,” Mr. Gelernt said.	1
352	If all goes well, Aliayha   will have an operation next month that will change her life. She will shed many of the 240 pounds that now burden her    frame. Like many who have bariatric surgery, she has tried diets and exercise to no avail. Surgery is her last best hope. But there is a difference between Aliayha and almost everyone else who has had this operation: She is only 15. While the number of adolescents who are overweight or obese has leveled off in recent years, the number who are severely obese  —   heavy enough to qualify for bariatric surgery  —   has nearly doubled from 1999 to 2014, according to national data, going from 5. 2 to 10. 2 percent of all adolescents aged 12 to 19. As a result, more and more doctors and parents are facing a difficult question: Should very heavy teenagers have bariatric surgery, a radical operation that is the only treatment proved to produce lasting weight loss in severely obese people? The very idea fills many parents and doctors with trepidation, and with good reason, said Aaron Kelly, a physiologist and specialist in pediatric obesity at the University of Minnesota. “We’re at a point in this field where surgery is the only thing that works for these kids but we don’t know the long term outcomes. ” The best data are from two recently published small studies that so far have outcomes for just five years. Scientists say there’s an urgent need for more ambitious research. The question for teens and their parents is: Which is worse  —   accepting uncertainty about the long term health risks from surgery or the likelihood of serious health risks from remaining obese? An estimated three to four million adolescents are heavy enough to meet the criteria for bariatric surgery, Dr. Kelly said. But only about 1, 000 teenagers a year have the operation. Many medical centers will not perform it on teenagers and many pediatricians never mention it to their heavy patients. “It obviously is a controversial area,” said Dr. Marc P. Michalsky, the surgical director at the Center for Healthy Weight  Nutrition at Nationwide Children’s Hospital in Columbus, Ohio.. Obesity carries serious health risks in teenagers  —   including type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, sleep apnea, acid reflux, fatty liver and high cholesterol levels  —   that tend to be eased by surgery. Added to that are social problems, including isolation and depression. Yet insurers routinely turn down teenagers on the first request, doctors say, leaving surgeons to appeal, sometimes multiple times, before they can operate on an adolescent. Dr. Kirk W. Reichard, the clinical director of pediatric surgery at the Nemours Alfred I. duPont Hospital for Children where Aliayha is planning to undergo her operation, said Delaware’s Medicaid program had denied coverage for all patients under the age of 18 with one exception. When it comes to adult bariatric surgery, doctors say, insurers usually do not put up a fight. But doctors and patients often discount the option. “We still struggle with acceptance in the adult population,” said Dr. John M. Morton, the chief of bariatric and minimally invasive surgery at Stanford. “Acceptance in the pediatric community is even worse. ” The two recently published studies on outcomes were encouraging, obesity experts say. One, involving 58 adolescents, was led by investigators at Children’s Hospital Medical Center in Cincinnati. The other, led by researchers at the University of Gothenburg in Sweden, involved 81 adolescents. Most of the participants in both studies lost at least a third of their weight and kept it off for at least five years. Diabetes often went into remission. Blood pressure readings that were high often fell to normal levels. Despite their weight loss, 63 percent of the teenagers were still severely obese after the surgery  —   only one reached a normal weight  —   and nearly half had nutritional abnormalities, including iron deficiency anemia and low levels of vitamin D and vitamin B12. Nearly half had hyperparathyroidism, a serious condition that leads to the leaching of calcium from bone. Many more could have reached a normal weight, said Dr. Thomas Inge, the director of adolescent metabolic and bariatric surgery at Children’s Hospital Colorado in Aurora, who led the Cincinnati study, if they had had the operation when they were younger, before they got so obese. The participants’ average age was 17 and their average body mass index was 58. 5. (That corresponds to person 5 feet 4 inches tall who weighs 341 pounds.) Some researchers worry that five years may not be long enough to understand the effect of the surgery on people who undergo it as an adolescent. The operations alter brain signals that control weight and appetite and change hundreds of nerve and hormonal signals to the brain. What, researchers ask, are the consequences for   brains and bones and bodies? Could low levels of vitamin D cause osteoporosis? The procedure for teenagers is the same as for adults  —   either a sleeve gastrectomy, in which much of the stomach is cut away to form a small pouch, or a gastric bypass in which the stomach is made smaller and part of the small intestine is rerouted. The operations are just as safe in teenagers as in adults, surgeons say: Mortality rates are around 0. 1 percent, which makes them safer than gallbladder surgery or joint replacement. Both operations require patients to follow detailed medical instructions, including taking supplements for the rest of their lives after surgery. Adolescents, though, are not always the most compliant patients. Dr. Inge said that when he first started offering the surgery in 2004, several of his patients developed beriberi, a serious condition that can affect the heart and nervous system. It is caused by a lack of thiamine. The beriberi problem was solved, Dr. Inge said, after he began warning patients and insisting they take a thiamine tablet for six months after surgery. “We never saw it again,” he said. To qualify for bariatric surgery, teenage patients generally must have a body mass index of at least 40, with other medical problems like sleep apnea or diabetes, or a B. M. I. of at least 50 without related medical conditions. Bariatric surgery is the only effective weight loss option for most of these teenagers. Diets, exercise and behavioral therapy almost never solve their weight problem, said Dr. Stephen R. Daniels, pediatrician in chief at Children’s Hospital Colorado. Moreover, an obese adolescent is almost certain to become an obese adult. The grim prognosis, “debunks the wishful thinking that they will outgrow it,” Dr. Michalsky said. Of course the best option would be to prevent kids from becoming obese in the first place, but that is not so easy. There seems to be a strong genetic component that is not easily overridden. Most of the teenagers who have the surgery have a parent who also is extremely obese, said Margaret H. Zeller, a professor of pediatrics and psychologist at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital whose research focuses on adolescents with severe obesity. Dr. Morton has operated on patients from three generations in some families. But despite their qualms about possible medical problems with bones or other body systems in the future, many researchers and surgeons say those concerns are dwarfed by the consequences of being an obese teenager. “I am less concerned about osteoporosis than that their lives will be completely destroyed if they don’t get some serious weight off,” said Dr. Lee M. Kaplan, the director of the weight center at Massachusetts General Hospital. By completely destroyed, he adds, he means “medically, socially and economically. ” “I’ve had many patients tell me they’d rather be dead,” than remain fat, Dr. Morton said. In almost every aspect, life for very obese teenagers is “significantly impaired,” Dr. Zeller said. These difficulties, Dr. Zeller noted, are piled onto the normal angst of adolescence. “It’s not just that people make them feel uncomfortable,” she said. The physical effort of carrying the weight around can make simple tasks arduous, like walking from one area of a high school to another or sitting at desks too small for them. Many have sleep apnea, making it difficult to stay awake in class. And, she said, “inside, they are feeling ashamed. ” Although not every obese teenager feels isolated and friendless, many, including Aliayha, do. She asked to be   but her mother, Cristina Carrasco, refused. Aliayha was not alone in wanting to leave school. Overwhelmed by their struggles, as many as 10 percent of obese students in grades eight to 12 leave the classroom and are   or take online classes instead, Dr. Zeller and her colleagues have found. That is nearly three times the rate of home schooling in the general population in those grades, according to the Department of Education. But some teenagers expect too much from the surgery. They are told they will lose a significant amount of weight, feel better and be healthier but that they are unlikely to reach a normal weight. They are told the surgery will not solve all their problems. Some, though, hold out unrealistic expectations. “They see shows about bariatric surgery or YouTube. They have this idea about the before and afters,” Dr. Zeller said. But, she added, “the average person having bariatric surgery isn’t doing a YouTube video. ” Dr. Morton worries about what he calls social  . “When they lose the weight, they are not always prepared,” he said Tiffany Hunter can attest to that. She had the surgery when she was 15 and weighed 350 pounds. Now, 27 and    she weighs 190. “Being overweight, you think being skinny will solve all your problems,” she said. “It doesn’t. It makes new problems that you don’t know how to deal with. ” She added, “You think everyone will immediately like you because of how you look on the outside. ” At 15, Tiffany was not only one of the first but also one of the youngest in the country to have the surgery at the time. But some bariatric surgeons wonder if adolescents and surgeons are waiting too long. Dr. Daniels went from being shocked to hear at a meeting in 2003 that doctors were considering bariatric surgery for adolescents to wondering if a bar of a B. M. I. of 40 or 50 is too high. There was no real science behind those guidelines, he noted. He also worries about children who get fatter and fatter throughout childhood, reaching a level of obesity by adolescence that, even with surgery, will still leave them obese as they head into adulthood. Dr. Michalsky shares those concerns. “We can only expect so much out of these operations,” Dr. Michalsky said. The longer the teenagers wait for the surgery and the fatter they get, the less likely they are to reach a normal weight. But how young is too young? Should it be done on children? Dr. Morton said the only place he knows where surgeons have done bariatric surgery on children is Saudi Arabia. He and others think it is best to wait until puberty to avoid interfering with physical, mental and emotional development. But, once again, doctors are acting on hunches, they say. “We get asked very often what is the lower age limit, but we really don’t know,” Dr. Michalsky said.	1

447	Every spring, Arctic plants rely on direct and indirect cues from the environment  —   like warmer weather, longer days and shrinking sea ice cover  —   to tell them when they should awaken from winter’s slumber. But as the climate warms, these plants are getting mixed signals about when to rouse. In a new paper published in Biology Letters, researchers detail findings from a   study of when plant species in the low Arctic region of Greenland first green up in the spring. Timing varied from plant to plant, but one speedy sedge species  —   a flowering, grasslike herb  —   stirred a full 26 days earlier than it did a decade ago. The change corresponds to nearly an entire growing season, and breaks the record for the greatest shift in spring emergence that the scientists have observed in the Arctic. Changes in growing seasons were associated with diminishing sea ice cover, which serves as a reminder that this loss may “have widespread effects on life on land,” said Jeffrey Kerby, an environmental studies researcher at Dartmouth College and an author of the study. Shifting patterns of plant growth may affect the availability of nutritious food for herbivores, for example. Dr. Kerby and his colleagues found in 2013 that more caribou calves died early in years when spring plant growth preceded the animal’s calving season. Over all, the difference between early bloomers and late bloomers widened, with longer periods of no plants blooming at all, the researchers found in the new study. According to Eric Post, an ecology professor at the University of California, Davis and the paper’s lead author, transformations in the Arctic are happening so rapidly that they are discernible to researchers who have studied its ecology for decades. “As a climate scientist who studies the start of spring, I struggle to answer the question, ‘What is spring? ’” said Heidi Steltzer, a professor at Fort Lewis College and author of the paper. “A longer spring opens up the potential for gaps  —   points in time when it would be spring with no springlike events occurring. Would this still be spring?”	1
223	Picture it: Manhattan, 2017. A crisp Saturday morning. Every table in Rue La Rue Cafe  —   a new restaurant in Washington Heights dedicated to Rue McClanahan and her hit television series, “The Golden Girls”  —   was occupied, including one in a replica of the kitchen set from the show. The pumps Ms. McClanahan (Blanche) wore in the pilot episode are displayed in a glass case. Mannequins draped in her gowns surrounded a pianist and guitarist playing mellow jazz on a corner stage. Behind them, on a pedestal, was her 1987 Emmy for lead actress. When the musicians took a break, a mounted television was turned up so customers could watch episodes that play steadily. Conversation happily quieted as Bea Arthur (Dorothy) and Hal Linden were heard saying good night after a   date. “This is a museum!” said a woman in line to order. From behind the counter, the   Michael J. LaRue, replied, “It’s a museum with good food. ” Few series radiate the necessary warmth to justify a tribute restaurant, but “The Golden Girls,” that enduring electric blanket of American television, is a part of the culture that people have held tight. It has been 25 years since the end of the sitcom about four older Miami housemates  —   Dorothy, the salty wit Rose (Betty White) the lovable dim bulb Sophia (Estelle Getty) the Italian spitfire and Blanche, the Southern vixen  —   but fans keep finding new ways to love it, with countless parodies, action figures and   and Hulu’s recent nabbing of exclusive streaming rights. For all the show’s zany plots, what fans seem to cherish most are the intimate scenes in which the four friends sit around their kitchen table, sharing a cheesecake and talking into the night. That spirit has now become a guiding force for Mr. LaRue, 53, who owns the restaurant with Ms. McClanahan’s son, Mark Bish. Mr. LaRue first met Ms. McClanahan at an animal rights charity event at Studio 54. They quickly became best friends, he said, and she repeatedly asked him, in jest, to marry her so she could be Rue LaRue. When Ms. McClanahan died in 2010, he became the executor of her estate, which includes an extensive personal archive that Ms. McClanahan wanted made available to her fans. “A little voice in my head said, ‘Restaurant! ’” Mr. LaRue said during a recent interview. A   resident of Washington Heights, he had no other neighborhood in mind for the new spot. “Before, we’d have to go downtown for good food and live entertainment,” he said. “I want people to stay in the neighborhood, and if they don’t live here, to come uptown. ” Construction on the space, formerly a pet store, lasted nearly a year. The bathroom was outfitted to match the show’s pink and mint tiles, with a bawdy door Ms. McClanahan had designed for her California house. The banana leaf Martinique wallpaper on two walls was   to match its exact look in Blanche’s bedroom. CHOCnyc, an Inwood bakery, created a cheesecake in honor of each Girl, and the Bronx Brewery provided two custom beers. The menu, from Michele Weber, formerly the chef at Good Enough to Eat, will feature nods to the show  —   lasagna al forno, Genügenflürgen cake  —   and recipes shared by the cast: Ms. Arthur’s chutney, Ms. White’s angel food cake, Ms. Getty’s pasta salad. There are also signature coffee blends: Sophia’s “Picture It” Sicilian Roast (inspired by a favorite line of the character) Rose’s St. Olaf blend, Dorothy’s   Roast, and, for a little spice, Blanche’s Gentlemen Caller’s Beans. “My grandma loved the show,” said Patrick Rickerfor, 41, who was making his fourth visit to Rue La Rue. “She was from Honduras and didn’t understand English all that well, but she got the slapstick comedy. ” Ana Perez, 28, was back for the second day in a row. “I’m a Blanche,” she admitted proudly. Anabel Perez, 23, her sister, said, “I’m a Dorothy. ” “And we’ve got a little Sophia over there,” Ana added, gesturing to their young cousin, buried in a game on her smartphone. “It was my favorite show growing up. That episode where Mario Lopez got deported makes me cry. ” Junko (a Sophia) and Paul Lindberg (a Rose) were   when they noticed that the cafe had opened. They threw their bags down at home and raced over. “We used to walk by here every day, thinking, ‘When’s it going to open? ’” Ms. Lindberg said. “My mom in Japan keeps asking me, ‘Is that cafe open yet? ’” Bix Gabriel, from Bloomington, Ind. and her sister Marisa Gabriel, from Adelaide, Australia, overheard talk of the place in an Ethiopian restaurant a few nights earlier and frantically Googled. “We sang the theme song coming in,” Bix Gabriel said. “The show was so progressive and ahead of its time,” Joe Samalian, Ms. Gabriel’s husband, added. “It passes the Bechdel test like you wouldn’t believe. ” “I must say,” Marisa Gabriel said, leaning in, “‘The Golden Girls’ is the best cure for postpartum depression. I have two children, and I watched it each time, and it helped me immensely. ” Mr. LaRue echoed a similar sentiment: “I know people who put on ‘Golden Girls’ DVDs the way others take a Valium. ” One of the walls features photographs of Ms. McClanahan’s six husbands, while another is dedicated to Ms. White, the last surviving Girl, who hopes to get to Rue La Rue in the spring. Near the end of Ms. McClanahan’s life, Ms. White sent her a fresh orchid every week, as well as pears and oranges from California. “She would call and say, ‘Can I talk to Ruesy? ’” Mr. LaRue recalled. “One day, right before the stroke, do you know what they were talking about? Ryan Reynolds. Betty was in that movie ‘The Proposal,’ and Rue’s in the hospital, like, ‘Who’s that young man? He’s delicious.’ She was   up until the last minute of her life. ” Mr. LaRue is full of these stories, and happy to share them. “She sewed for me, she baked for me,” he said. “My mother died when I was 8 years old. I had this hole in my being that I didn’t even realize. ” A sidewalk plaque at the entrance bears Ms. McClanahan’s name and the opening lyrics of the show’s theme song, “Thank You for Being a Friend. ” Some of her ashes are buried underneath. “There’s never a time when ‘The Golden Girls’ is not playing on this globe,” Mr. LaRue said. “It taps into something that we all share as human beings  —   a fear that as we age we’re going to become irrelevant and alone. The show is a tonic for that fear. It says you can still look good and have sex and have a very full life, with friends. ” “I once asked Rue why she got married so often, and she said, ‘I don’t want to die alone,’” he recalled. “And she didn’t I was there, holding her. I was able to look in her eyes and tell her, ‘Everything’s going to be O. K. you have nothing to worry about. ’” He smiled, suddenly teary. “I still miss her. ” Looking around the cafe, he added, “But she would love this. ” On the television, Ms. McClanahan, Ms. Arthur and Ms. White sang “Mr. Sandman” to lull a baby to sleep. Patrons, seeking shelter from the cold, happily watched. The baby quieted, and the Girls tried to tiptoe off. He cried, and they started up again. They sang until he slept.	1
780	 There is an article making its rounds Facebook (and also reddit) today about a Tennessee Walmart where a man allegedly started biting people. Multiple injured one taken to hospital for being bitten in the neck. Not true I am sure as the two news sources I was able to find it on were unreliable news sites. Link is below. Several Injured In Zombie-Like Attack At Tennessee Walmart, As Man Tries To Eat His Victims.An unidentified man entered a Tennessee Walmart on Tuesday, armed with nothing more than his own teeth. Eyewitnesses say the man, who look like he had been living off the streets, entered the store looking as if he was in a “daze.” When confronted by a Walmart employee, the homeless man lunged at the victim sinking his teeth into the employees arm. As one of the customers attempted to save the employee, the crazed man bit the shopper in the neck.This incident comes just two days after a 24-year-old Brazilian man collapsed and died aboard an Irish aircraft after biting another passenger.  The man was said to possibly be on methamphetamines when he became frantic and began biting into the flesh of another passenger on board. Unfortunately, authorities say they have seen an increase in these types of attacks, calling them Zombie-Like assaults.

204	If you are reading this hunched over your desk or smartphone, take this moment to loosen up your neck. Move it up and down. Now side to side. Roll it around clockwise and counterclockwise. Now retract it into your shell. Oh wait, you can’t do that  —   you are not a turtle. But have you ever wondered how these reptiles evolved to have such an interesting trick? Scientists have, and now after studying the cervical bones of a     turtle fossil, a team of researchers thinks that most turtles developed the ability first as a way to spring their head forward quickly to snatch prey, rather than as a means of protection, as was previously thought. The ability further evolved in some turtles to become a crucial part of their defenses. The researchers published their study Thursday in the journal Scientific Reports. The earliest known turtle ancestors were unable to retract their necks, but today’s modern species can. To understand turtle necks, however, you must first understand the two main types of turtles: cryptodires and pleurodires. Both turtle groups can retract their necks, but they do it differently. Cryptodires include tortoises as well as most turtles: box turtles, sea turtles and alligator snapping turtles. They retract their necks straight back into their shells by folding the muscles vertically. Pleurodires include species that are mostly found in South America, Australia and Africa, like the matamata and   turtles. They bend their muscles horizontally to pull their necks back to the side and tuck it next to their shoulder. Jérémy Anquetin, a paleontologist from the Jurassica Museum in Switzerland and the lead author, and his colleagues studied a     turtle fossil that had some strange characteristics. The turtle, known as Platychelys oberndorferi, was from the Late Jurassic period and lived in what is today Germany and Switzerland. From its shell and skeleton the team could clearly tell that it belonged to the pleurodira group. But the shape of its two cervical bones suggested that it pulled its neck back vertically as cryptodires do, not horizontally. The neck also appeared to be unable to fully fold into the shell. “Why did it have this neck retraction mechanism? This turtle is very peculiar,” Dr. Anquetin said. “Our fossil cannot retract it completely. It brings no value for protection, so we had to find an explanation for that. ” The team homed in on the creature’s other features for clues. Its appearance was similar to modern   turtles, suggesting that it was an ambush predator like the matamata turtle or the common snapping turtle. The two modern species are distantly related, but they hunt using similar tactics. They both lurk among the plants that shroud the floors of ponds, swamps and shallow lakes. Once an unsuspecting fish gets close enough, they strike. “We can expect that our turtle was behaving the same way,” Dr. Anquetin said. He and his team report that the neck mechanisms seen in their extinct turtle and in   cryptodires is an example of convergent evolution, meaning that both P. oberndorferi and   cryptodires evolved the ability independently of each other because of the evolutionary advantages that it offered them in their environments. The method of retracting their necks straight back allowed them to rapidly shoot out their heads and catch darting prey more easily. The researchers acknowledge that their hypothesis needs further testing and that it does not offer an explanation for why pleurodira turtles evolved to pull their necks in sideways. James Parham, an assistant professor of geological sciences at California State University, Fullerton, who has done research on turtles and lizards but was not involved in the study, said in an email the paper showed that the evolution of neck retraction in early turtles was more complex than the binary of folding the neck to the side versus bending it in vertically that we have ascribed to the reptiles today. He added that the team did a good job showing the similarities between the fossil turtle and   ambush turtles, but he agreed that the authors’ hypothesis needed further study. “They set the stage for some interesting new studies and force us to look at the evolution of these fossils in an entirely new light,” he said.	1
10	WASHINGTON  —   As the Central Intelligence Agency was setting up its secret prisons overseas 15 years ago to interrogate terrorism suspects, a Defense Department unit was considering a proposal to establish a secret military prison abroad, according to previously undisclosed government documents. The proposal was presented in a 2002 memo written in part by Bruce Jessen, one of two psychologists who eventually helped create the C. I. A. ’s “enhanced interrogation” program. The memo, obtained by The New York Times, recommended opening at least one secret overseas site where prisoners would be subjected to “constant sensory deprivation” and develop “ a profound sense of despair. ” The military, though, did not act on the proposal for an “undisclosed  . S. unsuspected, secure location” to “hold, manage and exploit detainees. ” The Department of Defense, through a spokeswoman, declined to comment on the extent to which the plan, which originated in the military’s Joint Personnel Recovery Agency, was considered. Aside from sensory deprivation, the memo suggested that additional pressure tactics be permitted against prisoners, including those that “maximize cultural undesirability,” but it did not mention the brutal physical coercion techniques, such as waterboarding, later approved for use in the C. I. A. prisons. The memo is included among several government documents provided during the discovery process in a lawsuit brought in federal court in Spokane, Wash. against Dr. Jessen and the other psychologist, James E. Mitchell, by two former C. I. A. prisoners and the representative of a third man, who died in custody. The documents, along with others previously released, are helping to fill in gaps in the historical record about the interrogation program of the George W. Bush era. Their disclosure comes soon after the Trump administration drafted an executive order calling for reviving the C. I. A. “black site” prisons, though the White House has since appeared to back off from the idea after lawmakers and cabinet officials objected. Also disclosed in the lawsuit were a series of PowerPoint training slides for American personnel apparently headed to the military detention center at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, discussing how they could defeat efforts by terrorism suspects to resist questioning. Those slides  —   or a similar set  —   were used in a training course by Dr. Jessen and a colleague in March 2002, and excerpted in a 2008 Senate Armed Services Committee report. Among the potential methods listed are “psychological torture” through “isolation, threats against self or family” and “the use of drugs. ” When Dr. Jessen’s memo was written in April 2002, he was the chief psychologist at the Joint Personnel Recovery Agency, a Defense Department unit overseeing training programs in which military personnel are subjected to simulated torture tactics and mock interrogation to prepare them for possible capture by regimes violating the laws of war. Dr. Jessen and most of his colleagues had no experience in conducting actual interrogations, but the Department of Defense legal counsel sought information from the agency on detainee “exploitation” beginning in late 2001. Dr. Jessen soon left his military position to help set up the C. I. A. interrogation program, along with Dr. Mitchell. The two men eventually created their own company, Mitchell, Jessen and Associates, which received $81 million from the C. I. A. to manage the program. The existence of the 2002 memo was mentioned in the Senate report on detainee abuse published in 2008, but the document itself had not previously been made public. The memo recommended practices similar to those later used at C. I. A. sites, such as holding only one or two “subjects” at a time and having an “operational team” that included a psychologist, interrogators, interpreters, guards, a physician, an intelligence officer and other support personnel, including video technicians. The plan called for “  feed between interrogation rooms, confinement cells and control room. ” It also described ethically conflicting roles for the physician  —   both advising interrogators and treating the subject. The memo was written at a time when Pentagon officials were deeply divided over the military’s role in detention and interrogation in the new war on terrorists. Many officials were already uneasy about interrogation procedures being used at the military detention center in Guantánamo Bay. The memo’s solution to the mounting internal criticism was to have a small team led by the Joint Personnel Recovery Agency run a smaller, more efficient prison. The memo also insisted that secrecy be paramount and that the International Committee of the Red Cross, which monitors prisoners of war to ensure they are treated humanely, be kept out of the proposed prison. “No press, IRC, US or foreign observers,” the memo states. “These documents reveal some of the earliest planning for the systematic torture and abuse that Jessen and others would inflict on U. S. prisoners,” said Dror Ladin, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union, which is representing the former detainees. The emphasis on keeping the prisons hidden showed, Mr. Ladin said, that those involved in the plans “knew that what they were doing was wrong. ” Asked about the documents, a lawyer for Dr. Jessen distanced him from them. “While Dr. Jessen was the original author of the JPRA report, the document that the government produced in discovery is the final version that was modified by other government officials for specific purposes,” said the lawyer, James Smith, who also represents Dr. Mitchell. “Dr. Jessen had no role in creating that final version,” he wrote. Mr. Smith also asserted that “every action taken by Drs. Mitchell and Jessen was approved and directed by the C. I. A. after the Department of Justice and the Office of the President advised that the contemplated action was legal. ” He said the two men had no involvement in activities alleged in the plaintiffs’ complaint, which claimed the psychologists had designed and administered the C. I. A. ’s brutal interrogation program. According to the Senate report, Dr. Jessen drafted his memo and sent it to the senior civilian leadership and commander of the Joint Personnel Recovery Agency, Col. John R. Moulton, who is known as Randy. He requested that Dr. Jessen prepare a briefing to “take up for approval. ” When interviewed by the Senate committee, Colonel Moulton testified that he did not recall any subsequent briefings for United States Joint Forces Command on the proposal. Lawyers for Dr. Mitchell and Dr. Jessen have sought to depose several former C. I. A. officials in an effort to buttress the defense’s argument that the psychologists’ actions were approved by the C. I. A. Lawyers for the A. C. L. U. working with the Gibbons law firm of Newark, have said that they were trying to avoid asking the government to release classified information in the case, and instead were relying heavily on public records. Their strategy is to avoid demanding any information that might lead to the imposition of the state secrets privilege, which allows the government to prevent information from being made public in court cases by claiming it could damage national security. That could shut down the case. If it goes forward, a trial is expected to take place in June. In a filing in the case last week, Chad A. Readler, the acting United States assistant attorney general, and other government lawyers indicated that the government would seek to invoke the privilege to block testimony by James Cotsana, a former C. I. A. operations officer who Dr. Mitchell and Dr. Jessen have said supervised them at one time. The Justice Department requested additional time to invoke the state secrets privilege, it said, because the new C. I. A. director will need to assess whether to do so, and the attorney general will have to approve the plan. The multiple levels of review, the government added, “present unique challenges in this case given the recent change of administration. ” Subpoenas to depose John A. Rizzo, a former acting general counsel of the C. I. A. and Jose A. Rodriguez, a former deputy director of operations, were recently canceled by the defendants, who received statements from the two men instead. The A. C. L. U. is now seeking to depose them.	1
343	WASHINGTON  —   President Trump turned the power of the White House against the news media on Friday, escalating his attacks on journalists as “the enemy of the people” and berating members of his own F. B. I. as “leakers” who he said were putting the nation at risk. In a speech to the Conservative Political Action Conference, Mr. Trump criticized as “fake news” organizations that publish anonymously sourced reports that reflect poorly on him. And in a series of Twitter posts, he assailed the F. B. I. as a dangerously porous agency, condemning unauthorized revelations of classified information from within its ranks and calling for an immediate hunt for leakers. Hours after the speech, as if to demonstrate Mr. Trump’s determination to punish reporters whose coverage he dislikes, Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, barred journalists from The New York Times and several other news organizations from attending his daily briefing, a highly unusual breach of relations between the White House and its press corps. Mr. Trump’s barrage against the news media continued well into Friday night. “FAKE NEWS media knowingly doesn’t tell the truth,” he wrote on Twitter shortly after 10 p. m. singling out The Times and CNN. “A great danger to our country. ” The moves underscored the degree to which Mr. Trump and members of his inner circle are eager to use the prerogatives of the presidency to undercut those who scrutinize him, dismissing negative stories as lies and confining press access at the White House to a few chosen news organizations considered friendly. The Trump White House has also vowed new efforts to punish leakers. Mr. Trump’s attacks on the press came as the White House pushed back on a  report by CNN on Thursday night that a White House official had asked the F. B. I. to rebut a New York Times article last week detailing contacts between Mr. Trump’s associates and Russian intelligence officials. The report asserted that a senior White House official had called top leaders at the F. B. I. to request that they contact reporters to dispute the Times’s account. “The fake news doesn’t tell the truth,” Mr. Trump said to the delight of the conservatives packed into the main ballroom at the Gaylord National Resort and Convention Center just south of Washington. “It doesn’t represent the people, it doesn’t and never will represent the people, and we’re going to do something about it. ” In the West Wing less than three hours later, the consequences were becoming clear. Mr. Spicer told a handpicked group of reporters in a briefing in his spacious office that the White House would relentlessly counter coverage it considered inaccurate. “We’re going to aggressively push back,” he said, according to a recording of the session provided by a reporter who was allowed to attend. “We’re just not going to sit back and let, you know, false narratives, false stories, inaccurate facts get out there. ” Reporters from The Times, BuzzFeed News, CNN, The Los Angeles Times, Politico, the BBC and The Huffington Post were among those shut out of the briefing. Aides to Mr. Spicer admitted only reporters from a group of news organizations that, the White House said, had been previously confirmed. Those organizations included Breitbart News, the One America News Network and The Washington Times, all with conservative leanings. Journalists from ABC, CBS, The Wall Street Journal, Bloomberg and Fox News also attended. Reporters from The Associated Press and Time magazine, who were set to be allowed in, chose not to attend the briefing in protest of the White House’s actions. The Washington Post did not send a reporter to the session. “Nothing like this has ever happened at the White House in our long history of covering multiple administrations of different parties,” Dean Baquet, the executive editor of The Times, said in a statement. “We strongly protest the exclusion of The New York Times and the other news organizations. Free media access to a transparent government is obviously of crucial national interest. ” Marty Baron, the Post’s editor, called Mr. Spicer’s decision to exclude some news organizations from a scheduled briefing “appalling. ” “This is an undemocratic path that the administration is traveling,” Mr. Baron said. “There is nothing to be gained from the White House restricting the public’s access to information. ” The White House played down the drama surrounding Friday’s briefing. “We invited the pool, so everyone was represented,” Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the deputy White House press secretary, said in an email Friday afternoon, referring to the small group of reporters on hand at the White House each day to follow the president and send reports to the broader press corps. “We decided to add a couple of additional people beyond the pool. Nothing more than that. ” The White House Correspondents’ Association, which represents the press corps, also protested the decision. But Jeff Mason, the organization’s president, pointed out that the White House had provided   briefings and accepted questions from a variety of news outlets since Mr. Trump took office. “We’re not happy with how things went today,” Mr. Mason said in an interview. “But it’s important to keep in mind the context of how things have gone up until now. ” He added: “I don’t think that people should rush to judgment to suggest that this is the start of a big crackdown on media access. ” Still, the Committee to Protect Journalists, which typically advocates press rights in countries with despotic regimes, issued an alarmed statement on Friday about Mr. Trump’s escalating language. “It is not the job of political leaders to determine how journalists should conduct their work, and sets a terrible example for the rest of the world,” said the group’s executive director, Joel Simon. “The U. S. should be promoting press freedom and access to information. ” Mr. Trump, in his attack on the news media at the conservative gathering, complained at length about the use of anonymous sources in news stories, charging that some reporters were fabricating unnamed sources to level unfair charges against him. “They shouldn’t be allowed to use sources unless they use somebody’s name,” Mr. Trump said. “Let their name be put out there. ” At another point, he said, “A few days ago, I called the fake news the enemy of the people because they have no sources  —   they just make it up. ” He added that his “enemy of the people” label applied only to “dishonest” reporters and editors. Those comments came shortly after his own aides had held a briefing for the White House press pool on the condition of anonymity to deny CNN’s story suggesting there had been improper contact between the White House and the F. B. I. regarding the Times article on Russian contacts. Later, in the briefing from which the Times was excluded, Mr. Spicer said that it was top F. B. I. officials  —   first Andrew G. McCabe, the deputy director, and later James B. Comey, the director  —   who approached Reince Priebus, the White House chief of staff, the day after the article appeared to say that it was false. Mr. Priebus then asked the two F. B. I. officials what they could do to rebut it publicly. They apologized and said they were unable to issue a statement or otherwise comment on the matter, Mr. Spicer said. “They came to us and said the story is not true. We said, ‘Great, could you tell people that? ’” Mr. Spicer said, describing the discussions between Mr. Priebus and F. B. I. officials. The F. B. I. on Friday declined to provide its account of those conversations. On Thursday night an F. B. I. official said that the White House had asked last week for the bureau’s help disputing the article, and that senior F. B. I. officials had rejected the request, citing the investigation into Russian efforts to affect the election. The article reported that current and former American officials said that phone records and intercepted calls showed that members of Mr.  Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign and other Trump associates had repeated contacts with senior Russian intelligence officials in the year before the election. The intercepts alarmed American intelligence and law enforcement agencies, in part because of the amount of contact that was occurring while Mr. Trump was speaking glowingly about the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin. Last week the White House declined to comment on the Times article and referred reporters back to Mr. Spicer’s previous assertions that Mr. Trump’s campaign had no contact with the Russian government. Mr. Baquet said on Friday that The Times “had numerous sources confirming this story. ” “Attacking it does not make it less true,” Mr. Baquet added. Mr. Spicer’s   Friday session, known as a gaggle, was scheduled as an   event, less formal than his usual briefings that are carried live on cable news. But past administrations have not selected outlets that can attend such sessions. Representatives of the barred news organizations made clear that they believed the White House’s actions were punitive. “Apparently this is how they retaliate when you report facts they don’t like,” CNN said in a statement. Tensions always emerge between an administration and the reporters who cover it, and it is not unusual for a White House to single out groups of journalists for special briefings outside of the daily      session. The Obama White House was harshly criticized by members of the press corps after it tried to exclude Fox News from interviews with top administration officials. But press relations in the Trump White House have taken on a tinderbox dynamic, with journalists and press aides highly suspicious of each other’s motives. “The grass is dry on both sides,” said Ari Fleischer, who was press secretary to George W. Bush, “so it only takes a very small match to light it on fire. ”	1
399	TUNIS  —   Tunisia has sent more fighters abroad to join the ranks of the Islamic State than any other country. And now, as the Islamic State takes a battering on the battlefields of Syria and Iraq, the country is at odds over what to do if and when they come home. Tunisians have been dealing with a frenzied polemic in recent weeks, as secularists have raised fears that a returning wave will bring further mayhem to this fragile state and Islamists have been forced to condemn the jihadists. “How can we accept those people who are professionals in war, in the use of arms and have a culture of being terrorists?” asked Badra Gaaloul, a   analyst who heads the International Center of Strategic, Security and Military Studies. “We in Tunisia are in crisis, and we cannot accept these people. ” “It is a nightmare for Tunisia,” she added. “We are not ready for that. ” The concern is not academic. Ms. Gaaloul, among others, points to the experience of Algeria, which suffered through a   insurgency in the 1990s when jihadists returned from Afghanistan set on establishing Islamic law, and the army led a brutal war to crush them. Already there are signs that some of the 5, 500 Tunisians who have gone abroad, according to United Nations estimates, are seeking new targets at home and in Europe, where Tunisians have been implicated in several recent terrorist cases in France and Germany. For Tunisia, there is no easy solution. The new Constitution does not allow the government to bar them. They can be locked up for joining a terrorist group, or for committing crimes abroad, but cases are hard to build and charges difficult to prove. The president proposed amnesty, only to be vigorously opposed. So the country has settled into a harsh, and potentially illegal, system of monitoring. Domestic opponents and international rights groups, including Human Rights Watch last year and Amnesty International in a report issued in February, are protesting it as counterproductive. The threat of imprisonment and torture is deterring many from returning home, in effect rendering them stateless. Some are hiding in Turkey and Europe, where they may be ticking time bombs. There is no government program to   returning fighters or reintegrate them into society, said Ridha Raddaoui, a lawyer and   of a new report on terrorism in Tunisia by the Tunisian Forum for Economic and Social Rights. Families of suspects and fighters who have returned are persecuted rather than supported, he said. “The methods are pushing people to terrorism,” Mr. Raddaoui said. “We think the victims of terrorism are also the families. ” Tunisian fighters still hold prominent positions in the Islamic State and the Nusra Front in Syria. But of greater threat to Tunisia are those in Libya affiliated with Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, which is active in a   countries across North Africa and vows to bring Islamic rule to Tunisia and all of North Africa. “Their aim is still to destabilize the state,” said Col. Mokhtar Ben Nasr, who heads military analysis at the Tunisian Center for Global Security Studies. “They want to make people rise up over poverty and injustice, and they do propaganda to that effect. ” The violence the returning fighters and others who have been radicalized can sow has already been witnessed in Tunisia, which has suffered a drastic rise in instability and terrorism since the Arab Spring uprising of  . After the revolution, Qaeda followers, released from prison or returned from exile, were quick to exploit the new freedoms, taking over the mosques and establishing a network of cells across the country and training camps in Libya. While many interpreted the Arab Spring as proof that people power was more potent that terrorism, Al Qaeda was faster to organize than any other political movement and became the main terrorist threat to the country, according to the report on terrorism. “The terrorist current was one of the main beneficiaries of the Tunisian revolution,” the report concludes. “From the first months it quickly profited from the release of its detained members and from the climate of freedom to rebuild itself. ” Terrorists benefited from outside support, but their growth was critically linked to Tunisia’s internal problems, the report also said. By 2013, insurgents were embedded in the mountains on the western border with Algeria, and groups in the cities began a campaign of political assassinations, ambushes on the police and army, and suicide attacks. Since then, Tunisia has been hit by more than 50 terrorist attacks, including increasingly spectacular assaults orchestrated by groups based in Libya. More than 70 people were killed in mass shootings in 2015, many of them foreign tourists at the national Bardo Museum in Tunis and at a beach resort in Sousse. A suicide attacker killed 12 members of the presidential guard in central Tunis in November the same year. In their most ambitious attack to date, hundreds of Tunisian fighters tried to seize control of the Tunisian border town of Ben Gardane in March last year and fought Tunisian security forces in the streets for several hours. Tunisian officials insist their security forces are getting a grip on terrorism inside the country. Indeed, the rate of attacks has fallen off in recent months. “There has been a lot of work by the police and army,” Colonel Ben Nasr said. “They have dismantled the logistics and recruitment networks, and there is no longer this support system that there was in 2012 and 2013. ” United States airstrikes in Libya last February targeted a major Tunisian camp, where the perpetrators of the 2015 attacks had trained, and helped push the Islamic State out of the city of Surt  —   both major blows to the jihadists in Libya. Up to 400 Tunisian fighters were killed in Libya in the past year, according to Libyan security forces, yet hundreds remain at large, dispersed around the country and in camps in southern Libya. Al Qaeda’s leader, Ayman   called on Tunisians in a recent audio message to wage jihad to “excise tyranny” from the country. Researchers studying radicalization in Tunisia say police harassment is still pushing young people to run off and join the extremists. “Their territory is diminishing but not their numbers,” said Mohamed Iqbal Ben Rejeb, who founded the Rescue Association of Tunisians Trapped Abroad after his brother was recruited to fight in Syria. In December, President Béji Caïd Essebsi of Tunisia floated the idea of a pardon for returning fighters, saying there was no more room in the prisons. But after opposition protesters flooded the news media and television chat shows, he ruled out the idea, promising there would be no pardon and no amnesty. Islamist leaders, who have been sympathetic to young jihadists, have joined him in insisting that all returning fighters go before the courts on their return. “Those who survive will have to go before justice and pay for what they did,” Abdelfattah Mourou, a   of the Ennahda party and deputy speaker of Parliament, said in an interview. “They killed people, and they have to pay. ” But human rights activists and others say that leaving the jihadists no way out allows the cycle of radicalization to continue. Mr. Ben Rejeb said he knew of dozens of Tunisians who wanted to come home, many of them trapped in jails in Syria and Libya. The government will not be able to stop fighters from returning, said Mr. Raddaoui, the lawyer, and it may well find it difficult to pin crimes on them for lack of evidence. “There are no autopsies, no police reports,” he said of the crimes committed on distant battlefields. Of greater concern, Mr. Raddaoui said, is that in reading the court papers of the 500 Tunisians who have been processed since their return, he has seen no remorse. “What they admit to, they do not regret at all,” he said.	1
30	Maurice R. Greenberg, the former chief executive of American International Group, reached an unexpected settlement ending a tumultuous,   battle over civil accounting fraud charges first brought in 2005 by New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer. Mr. Greenberg, 91, and his   Howard Smith, A. I. G. ’s former chief financial officer, reached the agreement with the current New York attorney general, Eric T. Schneiderman, who announced it on Friday. In the settlement, the two men acknowledged that they had participated in and approved two transactions that inaccurately portrayed A. I. G. ’s financial results over four years. They agreed to give up more than $9. 9 million that they received as performance bonuses from 2001 through 2004, with Mr. Greenberg paying most of that amount. But it is a fraction of the more than $50 million the state had sought. The former executives also released statements acknowledging their roles in the transactions, but not admitting to fraud. After negotiations spanning about two months, the settlement was a quiet conclusion to a case that began during an era when Mr. Spitzer extracted large fines after accusing Wall Street research analysts of publishing biased research, mutual fund managers of shady trading and insurance brokers of rigging bids and receiving kickbacks. The Enron and WorldCom accounting frauds had shaken corporate boards. But Mr. Greenberg was determined to fight his case, and both sides dug in for a long battle. Neither Mr. Greenberg nor Mr. Spitzer have the same jobs they had in 2005, having receded from those prominent roles. The trial began in September before New York State Supreme Court Justice Charles E. Ramos after 11 years of delays and legal maneuvering, much of it as Mr. Greenberg appealed rulings by the judge. After his testimony and   in the trial, Mr. Greenberg and the lawyers arguing for the state began mediation in December. The trial had been set to resume last month, but was postponed pending the talks. The former executives were accused of overseeing two sham reinsurance deals aimed at duping A. I. G. investors. One deal turned auto warranty insurance losses into investment losses the other inflated A. I. G. reserves by $500 million. The charges led to Mr. Greenberg’s ouster in 2005 as chief of A. I. G. which he had built into a global insurance leader. In a statement on Friday, Mr. Schneiderman said, “Today’s agreement settles the indisputable fact that Mr. Greenberg has denied for 12 years: that Mr. Greenberg orchestrated two transactions that fundamentally misrepresented A. I. G. ’s finances. ” In his statement, Mr. Greenberg said he “initiated, participated in and approved these two transactions” as a result, A. I. G. ’s public filings “inaccurately portrayed the accounting, and thus the financial condition and performance for A. I. G. ’s loss reserves and underwriting income. ” In an interview, David Boies, Mr. Greenberg’s lawyer, called the agreement a “nuisance settlement,” noting that Mr. Greenberg had avoided two penalties sought by the state that would have barred him from working in the securities industry or as an officer of a public company. The settlement’s outline was framed by the mediator, Kenneth R. Feinberg. The transactions were featured when A. I. G. settled accounting fraud charges brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission in 2006. One, a reinsurance deal between A. I. G. and General Reinsurance Corporation, a company owned by Berkshire Hathaway, prompted federal criminal charges in Connecticut against several former executives of the companies two former Gen Re executives pleaded guilty. A 2008 jury verdict against five others was overturned on appeal. What began as a   battle was nasty from the start. Before he brought the charges in May 2005, Mr. Spitzer had forced the ouster of Mr. Greenberg’s son Jeffrey as chief executive of the insurance brokerage Marsh  McLennan after charging it with   and receiving kickbacks. And Mr. Greenberg complained that Mr. Spitzer was treating minor infractions, like “foot faults” in tennis, as capital crimes. Mr. Spitzer shot back, “too many foot faults, and you can lose the match. ” Early in the trial, Mr. Greenberg admitted to a sometimes active role in formulating the transactions at issue but insisted he had intended for them to comply with accounting rules. He said he had left most details to subordinates. On the stand, he lunged and parried with state trial lawyer David E. Nachman, avoiding simple answers so often that the judge chided him. “If we don’t want this trial to last a year, you’re going to have to give direct answers,” Judge Ramos said. In his opening statement, Mr. Boies said, “this case is devoid of any admissible evidence that ties Mr. Greenberg to anything that was improper about these two transactions. ” Saule Omarova, who specializes in the regulation of financial institutions as a professor at Cornell Law School, said the case was about the legacies of Mr. Greenberg as A. I. G. ’s longtime leader and Mr. Spitzer as a onetime prominent Wall Street regulator. Stepping back, she said, the case is a prominent example of regulators’ efforts to untangle the blame for “  activities at large financial conglomerates” that later loomed large in the financial crisis of 2008. Three years after the charges led to Mr. Greenberg’s ouster, A. I. G. nearly collapsed and needed an $185 billion federal rescue. Mr. Spitzer resigned as New York governor in 2008 in a prostitution scandal. The state and the two defendants had reached an agreement to settle the case just before A. I. G. ’s  . However, a steep drop in A. I. G. ’s stock price at that time reduced the value of a planned charitable donation of A. I. G. shares that would have been part of the settlement, and the agreement was called off. Before the trial, Judge Ramos ruled in favor of the state on one of the charges, but that was overturned on appeal, and the defense unsuccessfully sought to remove him from the case. In the Gen Re deal struck in 2000, the company was supposedly paying $10 million to get reinsurance from A. I. G. according to testimony by Christian M. Milton, a former A. I. G. executive. But A. I. G. arranged to repay the $10 million to Gen Re with a $5 million deal fee, he testified. The state charged that the “secret” fee repayment was a sign the reinsurance was bogus, intended mainly to allow A. I. G. to increase reserves by $500 million. But Mr. Greenberg, who initiated the deal by phoning the Gen Re chief executive, testified that he was not aware of the repayment plan. In a 2008 deposition admitted into evidence early in the trial, Alice Schroeder, a former Morgan Stanley insurance analyst, said that if she had known about the Gen Re transaction and its impact in raising A. I. G. ’s   reserve levels, she “almost certainly” would not have upgraded the stock in early 2001. She also described Mr. Greenberg as “a very   manager. ” One cloud over the state’s case was whether a deposition of Richard Napier, a former Gen Re executive, could come into evidence. Mr. Napier was an important prosecution witness in the Connecticut trial who in 2005 pleaded guilty to conspiring to commit securities fraud in the A. I. G. deal. While the defense objected to parts of Mr. Napier’s deposition as inadmissible “hearsay,” New York State lawyers argued that a “  exception” to hearsay rules should apply. Judge Ramos received briefs on the issue but had not ruled before the mediation effort began.	1
97	Before the 59th annual Grammy Awards on Sunday, the music industry murmured about what it might mean for Adele to once again sweep the top awards, leaving Beyoncé snubbed in the major categories and with her third loss for album of the year. Having long faced accusations that the Grammys overlook young, progressive black artists  —   the last black woman to win album of the year was Lauryn Hill in 1999  —   the Recording Academy faced a potential backlash for going   on a white, traditionalist choice like Adele. Indeed, it happened again. Now, building on a conversation that was already bubbling, some artists and industry observers are considering the potential fallout. “More and more artists are going to boycott and step away,” Laura Stylez, a   of “Ebro in the Morning” on the New York   and RB station Hot 97, said in an interview, citing the absence of Drake, Frank Ocean, Justin Bieber and Kanye West from this year’s show, despite their major eligible releases and nominations. “You don’t want to lose today’s generation. They feel like they’re not represented. ” Charlamagne Tha God, an influential radio personality from “The Breakfast Club” on Power 105. 1, named Grammy voters his “Donkey of the Day” for their album of the year selection. “I tell artists all the time: Go where you’re celebrated, not where you’re tolerated,” he said, adding that Beyoncé had been “robbed. ” “They absolutely, positively got it wrong,” he said. “The Grammy committee should all feel foolish this morning, because even Adele acknowledged that she should not have won album of the year. ” Solange Knowles, Beyoncé’s sister and herself a Grammy winner this year for best RB performance, tweeted her dismay not long after Sunday’s final award was presented, linking to an earlier diatribe by the singer Frank Ocean. Mr. Ocean, one of the most critically adored artists of the streaming generation, had declined to submit his music for consideration at this year’s Grammys, calling the boycott his “Colin Kaepernick moment. ” In a blog post after insinuations from Grammy producers that his absence was because of a disappointing performance at the 2013 show, Mr. Ocean called out the Recording Academy for what he said was a “cultural bias,” referring specifically to last year’s show, in which Taylor Swift’s “1989” won album of the year over the rapper Kendrick Lamar’s “To Pimp a Butterfly. ” After Beyoncé’s “Lemonade” lost to Adele’s “25” on Sunday, Terrence Henderson, an executive at Mr. Lamar’s label, Top Dawg Entertainment, also expressed his frustration. “Maybe Frank had a point,” he wrote on Twitter. This year’s show was not entirely homogeneous. In addition to a Prince tribute and exemplary performances by Beyoncé and A Tribe Called Quest, Chance the Rapper won three awards, including best new artist, for what was essentially an online mixtape. But the broader pattern was hard to ignore. In the last five years especially, albums by Mr. Ocean, Mr. Lamar and Beyoncé have been passed over for the top award in favor of releases by white artists: Mumford  Sons, Daft Punk, Beck, Taylor Swift and Adele. Though Beyoncé has 62 nominations and 22 wins overall, most have come in the designated RB categories, with only one in the big three of record, song or album of the year. “Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)” won best song in 2010. Only 10 black artists have ever won album of the year the last was Herbie Hancock, then 67, for a collection of Joni Mitchell covers in 2008. In light of Adele’s sweep on Sunday, the presentation of the award for best urban contemporary album, a minor hodgepodge of a category, to Beyoncé for “Lemonade” couldn’t help but feel like a consolation prize. She used her one speech on the telecast to highlight the importance of her children’s seeing themselves reflected at “the Super Bowl, the Olympics, the White House and the Grammys. ” Beyond that, Beyoncé, who is stingy with her extemporaneous commentary, has not spoken about her Grammy defeat. But she did have a surprise planned, win or lose: A new song with DJ Khaled and her husband Jay Z, released exclusively on his streaming platform Tidal, called “Shining. ” “All of this winning, I’ve been losing my mind,” she sings, seemingly above it all. “Don’t try to slow me down. ”	1
949	 SHOCKER!!!! A University female student confesses to have infected more than 324 men in Nakuru with HIV…. She targets 2000 before the year ends!!!!!!! I’m 19 and a 2nd year student here at Kabarak University. I joined this college a virgin though I have had boyfriends before,my parents are strict so having sex was never on my mind.Septmber 22nd, 2013, is a day I will never forget,we went clubbing in town and got drunk with some senior students then went back hostels for party around 2amI remember waking up naked to a guy called Javan with my private part painful and I realised he had sex with me when I was drunk. I only asked if he used a condom and he said yes.However, when taking bathIi noticed sperms down there,i wanted to commit suicide,i feared getting pregnant and HIV, I took drug and hoped i was HIV free.In November, I tested HIV positive,I felt like cutting off my neck. I confronted theguy and he insisted he was clean that I got it from somewhere.I was so depressed and took alcohol to die. I even bought poison,the pain was just unbearable. How was I gonna face the world? I let my parents down. I gave up on the world and just wanted to end my life.Something came up in my mind that I should revenge. I hated men and I didn’t want to be near anymore. My future had been ruined, somehow someone had to pay.After a private therapy sessions, I gained strength not even my parents,friends knew of my conditions even up to now.I accepted my fate and promised to make all men I come across suffer. i know I am attractive and both married and unmarried men chase me left, right and center, luckily, my body has remained good and if anything my curves got better something you men like.I buried the good girl in me and became the bad girl. My goal was to infect as many as possible. So far, since December up to now, I have infected 324 men and I make sure to note down there list which I secretly keep. I plan to release it when I wiil be on my death bed.I know I have nothing left to do on earth but to wait for my death but before i do, men will get it.My target is over 2000 by the end of the year, pregnancy is out of question because I am on contraceptives. So I just do raw which most men here love. They don’t even question becauase my looks and body work greatly for me.Out of the 324 I have infected so far, about 156 are students here at the college, the remaining are married men outside, lecturers,lawyers,some celebs and 3 politicians. Not a day passes without me having sex, mostly four people per day. A heterosexual person infected with HIV will transmit the virus to their partner once in every 900 times the couple has unprotected sex, according to a new study conducted in Africa.However, the exact number of sexual acts that are needed to transmit the virus can vary tremendously depending on the amount of the virus in the infected person’s blood, said study researcher James Hughes, of the University of Washington in Seattle. In her story there are some gaps and misinformation that gave us an impression she was lying about everything.[…]In Kabarak main campus, men are banned from ladies hostels and if any man is found loitering around the ladies hostels then he or she would be suspended from school.So the part where she said that they went back to the hostels and had an after party after partying in Nakuru town is All FALSE.[…]December has 31 days, January has 31 days and February has 28 days. If you add up the days you will end up with 90 days exactly. And the lady said she has infected 324 men from December. Let’s do the math.If you divide you will get 3.6 that is 3 different dudes per day.You will ask yourself is she a prostitute or what? How can a university student who has classes and assignments have time to f**k 3 dudes in one day. Social networks have been buzzing over the past couple of days with the story of a female university student who, over a period of five months, infected 586 men with HIV in “revenge.” The student, whose name has been withheld, claims to have infected married men, lecturers, fellow students and celebrities. According to the report, her aim was to infect 2,000 men with the virus. Her vengeance was met with horror and much criticism over social media.Her new goal is to infect at least 2,000 men stating, “I know I have nothing left to do on earth but wait for my death.” Surprisingly, she keeps a list of how many men she has slept with so far, and rewarded with HIV. According to her, she already infected 586 men and wanted to finish 2017 with the 2,000 mark.	0
386	Barack Obama has kept a relatively low profile since leaving office last month, and he largely avoided the spotlight on Friday night  —   at least as much as a former president can when he is attending a Broadway show. Shortly after the lights went down at the American Airlines Theater on West 42nd Street, there was a blur, and the brief shining of a flashlight. Three people quickly took their seats several rows back from the stage: Mr. Obama his eldest daughter, Malia and Valerie Jarrett, who was a senior adviser to the president. A woman sitting nearby let out a small yelp, but most of the audience at the revival of Arthur Miller’s “The Price’’ did not realize they were watching a Broadway show with someone who was, until recently, the most powerful person in the world. The play, starring Mark Ruffalo, Danny DeVito, Jessica Hecht and Tony Shalhoub, centers on two estranged brothers and their quest to reconnect. “Well, I actually didn’t know he was sitting in the row,” said Laralyn Mowers, 37, who lives in Astoria, Queens. She was sitting five seats to the right of Mr. Obama and did not realize he was there until a friend told her at intermission. “I had a really bad day and it all just changed. ” Ms. Mowers said she was actually irritated when the trio first came in. “Who is so rude to come in after the show starts with the flashlights and everything?” she said. Mr. Obama wore glasses during the show. At one point during the second act, he and his daughter sat in identical poses: right hands pressed to their chins while intently observing the drama before them. Just before intermission, again in darkness, Mr. Obama, his daughter and Ms. Jarrett were whisked backstage to greet the cast and to take pictures with the crew. Once more, most of the crowd was oblivious to his presence. After the play ended, the Obamas and Ms. Jarrett joined the crowd in a standing ovation for the cast, the most visible they had been all night. Minutes later, they were gone. The audience members who managed to see the former president were heard expressing surprise that he had been there. The Obamas have mostly kept out of sight since President Trump’s inauguration. After leaving office, Mr. Obama and Michelle Obama went to the British Virgin Islands at the invitation of Richard Branson, the founder of the Virgin Group. Mr. Branson challenged him to a kitesurfing contest. Mr. Obama won.  Photos of a smiling Mr. Obama kitesurfing and wearing his baseball cap backward set off a flurry of jokes on the internet and on late night comedy shows. A common thread: Was he ever coming back? Mrs. Obama was spotted by the Daily Mail leaving a SoulCycle class in Washington this week. And on Thursday night, the former president was spotted leaving a restaurant with Malia in New York City’s Little Italy. The Obamas have shown a fondness for Broadway. In 2009, Mr. Obama whisked Mrs. Obama away from Washington for a Saturday dinner and a theater date, taking in “Joe Turner’s Come and Gone. ” Five years later, the Obamas attended a performance of “A Raisin in the Sun,” starring Denzel Washington. Mr. Obama took both of his daughters to see a matinee performance of “Hamilton” in 2015. Last March, instead of leaving Washington, he brought “Hamilton” cast members to the White House to perform and to conduct a workshop with high school students. In November, Mr. Obama appeared at a   for Democrats that featured a special performance of the hit musical. Of course, Mr. Obama is not alone among politicians who attend Broadway shows. Hillary Clinton has been spotted at four Broadway shows since her defeat in November, and was greeted with adulation. In an episode that garnered much attention, Mike Pence, then the vice   was treated by a cast member to a brief statement about inclusion after seeing “Hamilton” in November. Mr. Trump, who helped finance a Broadway play in his 20s, and has said he is a fan of the composer Andrew Lloyd Webber, was not pleased. During Friday’s performance of “The Price,” a line from Mr. DeVito’s character, a furniture dealer, about the federal government being unreliable drew the biggest laugh of the night. Mr. Obama sat  . “He said that he was happy that it was while he was not in office,” Mr. Ruffalo said during an interview after the show.	1
76	ATHENS  —   In Greece’s biggest peacetime evacuation ever, about 72, 000 people left their homes in the city of Thessaloniki on Sunday as experts defused and removed a World War II bomb from below a gas station. Hundreds of police officers in Thessaloniki, the country’s   city, began knocking on doors early in the morning to remind residents within a radius of two kilometers, about 1. 2 miles, to leave their homes. Though residents had been given several days’ warning, with leaflets posted around the city and an online campaign by the local authorities, some were reluctant to leave and had to be convinced by the police that their properties would remain intact. “The security measures might be excessive, but it’s better to be excessive and be safe,” Greece’s public order minister, Nikos Toskas, warned in a televised message. The bomb was found last week under the gas station during excavation work aimed at expanding storage tanks. It was about five feet long and weighed about 550 pounds  —     of which was explosive, and the rest casing. The bomb had been dropped onto Thessaloniki by Allied forces in 1943 or 1944, toward the end of Greece’s occupation by Nazi Germany, according to the Greek news media. On Sunday, residents were transported by bus to schools and sports venues. Greek television broadcast images of bemused pensioners, many of whom lived through the Nazi occupation of Greece, sitting on plastic chairs and drinking bottled water provided by the local government. Others carried pet cats in boxes through empty streets or led   children by the hand as army officers stood guard near the   gas station. Hundreds of refugees who have been living at a former toilet paper factory, including many Syrians who fled strife in their country, were taken by aid workers to the city’s archaeological museum for the day. They were given snacks and taken to see the artifacts, aid workers said. “The refugees accepted the situation with stoicism and understanding,” Vassilis Karambidis, who runs the center, told Greece’s   news agency. “There were no protests, and those who were reluctant initially ultimately came round to the need to vacate the center. ” Over the course of an hour and a half, three Greek military pyrotechnic experts defused the bomb in an operation that “went very smoothly,” Apostolos Tzitzikostas, the regional governor, told reporters. He had declared a state of emergency in the city for the operation, suspending train routes and church services. The bomb was loaded onto an army vehicle and taken to a military shooting range near the city to be destroyed, Mr. Tzitzikostas said. About five hours after the defusion, residents started returning home. A local military spokesman, Colonel Nikolaos Fanios, played down the operation, noting that army experts had defused similar bombs found near the city’s international airport in the past. “This is a routine event for the army,” he told the Greek news media. The discovery of the bomb in a densely populated area, however, made Sunday’s evacuation necessary, he said, noting that an accidental explosion would have resulted in deaths within the   radius.	1
841	 I read a article saying mothers will be jailed in 2016 if they do not have a disability and not employed is this true?Mother's May Soon End Up In Jail For Being Unemployed http://t.co/1FI3aMQh3k— 'Vante Rashad (@RollUpNOkhalifa) August 4, 2015   Reportedly Congress will soon pass a law that all mothers without employment must have some source of  employment before August 2016. As it was reported after a recent Congress meeting, mothers are no longer allowed to sit at home and collect government assistance. Mother must show that there is some other way they can provide for their children besides assistance from the Government. If they can not provide some kind of employment information, mothers will be served and will have to explain to a judge why they feel the need to not work and collect free benefits. The U.S. board of welfare is willing to help mothers with sources that will hire them. Congress may have already agreed reportedly, that mothers who haven’t work for a span of 6 years or longer may served up to 15-30 days in a correctional facility, if a judge find that they haven’t made an valid effort to find employment. New Jersey has recently announced that they are cutting their child support program. It was said that Governor Chris Christie stated that he’s “sick and tired of lazy women collecting child support just to get their hair and nails done”. New Jersey has 1,000’s of men paying child support just so these women can sit back and collect welfare. Through a recent undercover investigation, we tracked 100’s of women in Newark during the 1st – 4th of every month for the last 5 months. Many of the women cleared their EBT card and headed straight to the hair salon. 	0
694	 When Sheikh Mohammed Kamel Alsaud purchased the small town of Buford, Wyoming from a Vietnamese entrepreneur last year for $1.8 million, his lifelong dream of bringing Islam to America was one step closer to becoming a reality.“I have fond memories of spending summers on the Mediterranean aboard my father’s yacht. On occasion we’d visit the Gulf [of Mexico] to entertain his American clients,” Alsaud told Forbes magazine. “Even as a child, I was always struck by the distinct lack of mosques in the U.S., but they say what America lacks in mosques, it makes up tenfold in prisons.”	0
931	 Did Pope Benedict say that the Bible and the Q’ran are the same? True or false? On Monday the Bishop Of Rome addressed Catholic followers regarding the dire importance of exhibiting religious tolerance. During his hour-long speech, a smiling Pope Francis was quoted telling the Vatican’s guests that the Koran, and the spiritual teachings contained therein, are just as valid as the Holy Bible.“Jesus Christ, Jehovah, Allah. These are all names employed to describe an entity that is distinctly the same across the world. For centuries, blood has been needlessly shed because of the desire to segregate our faiths. This, however, should be the very concept which unites us as people, as nations, and as a world bound by faith. Together, we can bring about an unprecedented age of peace, all we need to achieve such a state is respect each others beliefs, for we are all children of God regardless of the name we choose to address him by. We can accomplish miraculous things in the world by merging our faiths, and the time for such a movement is now. No longer shall we slaughter our neighbors over differences in reference to their God.”   On Wednesday the Bishop Of Rome addressed 11,000 ticketed guests on the South Lawn of the White House, during which he pontificated on the dire importance of exhibiting religious tolerance. During his hour-long speech, a smiling Pope Francis was quoted telling the White House guests that the Koran, and the spiritual teachings contained therein, are just as valid as the Holy Bible, and should therefore be respected as such.	0
198	One afternoon last summer at BEAM 6, an experimental program in downtown Manhattan for youths with a high aptitude for math, a swarm of   and    jockeyed for a better view of a poster labeled “Week One Challenge Problem. ” Is there a   number where the first digit is equal to how many 0’s are in the number, the second digit is equal to how many 1’s are in the number, the third digit is equal to how many 2’s are in the number, all the way up to the last digit, which is equal to how many 9’s are in the number? Within the scrum was a trio of   : “Can we work on this during Open Math Time?” one asked. The second, wearing    glasses and dogged by the fear that he did not belong  —   “I’m really not that good at math,” he had told me earlier  —   lingered at the snack cart. “Leave some for the rest of us, J. J. ,’’ demanded the third, gently elbowing him aside. To Mira Bernstein, a BEAM instructor and a leading figure in the extracurricular math ecosystem that incubates many of the nation’s scientists and engineers, the scene was unremarkable, except for one striking feature: None of the children were wealthy, and few were white or Asian. The 76 students, drawn from New York City public schools with   populations, were embarking on a curriculum that they would have to continue on their own during the school year to be eligible to apply for a second, even more intense math summer program, BEAM 7. That application is due at the end of this month, and with it comes a verdict of sorts on their membership in a   subculture where it can be astonishingly difficult to find others who look like them. “This is probably more   black and Hispanic kids than I’ve seen in my whole career,” said Dr. Bernstein, who received a Ph. D. in algebraic geometry from Harvard in the 1990s. “That’s why I’m here. ” The extreme racial homogeneity in the rarefied realm of young math wizards has drawn little attention in a nation where racial equality in the basic institutions of civic life  —   schools, housing, health care, policing  —   remains elusive. But it has become an increasing source of consternation for some mathematicians, educators and business leaders, who see it directly linked to the striking underrepresentation of blacks and Latinos in     jobs in finance, science and technology. As those occupations increasingly propel our society, they fear that enrichment programs for mathematically gifted children, while rooted in meritocratic ideals, have become a particularly potent means of reinforcing privilege. Even as movie audiences celebrate “Hidden Figures,” the story of black women who overcame legally sanctioned discrimination to perform critical calculations in the race to put a man on the moon, educators say that new, subtler obstacles to   math education have arisen. These have had an outsize influence on racial prejudice, they contend, because math prowess factors so heavily in the popular conception of intelligence  —   a concern that recently provoked the creation of “Mathematically Gifted and Black” and “Latin@s and Hispanics in Mathematical Sciences,” websites featuring math professionals from underrepresented backgrounds. “Fundamentally, this is a question about power in society,” said Daniel Zaharopol, BEAM’s director. “Not just financial power, but who is respected, whose views are listened to, who is assumed to be what kind of person. ” BEAM is short for Bridge to Enter Advanced Mathematics, and this, the program’s first year of BEAM 6, for students who had just completed the sixth grade, is what many within elite math circles see as the most promising effort yet to diversify their ranks. The four weeks, spent in a school near City Hall, would be intense: four hours of math a day taught by 10 experienced math teachers, several of them Ph. D.’s. There would be no prepping for standardized tests or effort to cover school material at a faster pace. Instead, as in the elite summer programs that Mr. Zaharopol had himself attended, BEAM focused on the kind of creative   that mathematicians say lie at the heart of the discipline. And because one summer would not be anywhere near enough to equip the BEAM   with the same kind of math preparation as their more affluent peers, the real goal of the founders  —   a mix of   millionaires and professional mathematicians  —   was to hook them enough to want to keep at it. A graduate of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who suspended his graduate studies in algebraic topology to launch BEAM, Mr. Zaharopol had some idea of what his students were up against. By age 12, many attendees of the highly selective programs on which BEAM was modeled had already won regional math contests and completed online math courses in subjects like number theory. Some had been introduced to advanced math in school honors programs or by math teams. Many were the children of scientists and engineers, or of   parents who turned to math as another way to give their children a competitive edge in the battle for admission to elite colleges. “When I was 6, my dad taught me to use the abacus and do mental math,” one student at a selective program called MathPath wrote on the application form. By contrast, BEAM students come from environments where “math is not in the air,” Dr. Bernstein said. The parents of the boy at the snack cart, Jonathan Jackson, do not have degrees in math or science. His school, Kipp STAR, is a   charter school in Harlem, but does not have a math team. And like many of the other students at BEAM, Jonathan, who is   seemed to have already internalized the racial stereotypes about math that, studies have shown, shape   among young Americans of all backgrounds. “They did a study that shows white kids have more chances,” he said once, remembering a fragment of something he had been told. Then he shrugged, “I don’t know if it’s really true. ” Tracing Jonathan’s path through the program and into the school year provides a glimpse of both how easy it might be to nurture a love of math, and how daunting. It is also a testament to the persuasive power of friendship, unfolding over several months in the context of prime numbers and polyhedron sculptures. Jonathan, who chose J. J. as his summer nickname, had done everything in his power to avoid attending BEAM, which is financed by individual donors and foundations, and is free to participants. Then 11, he was chosen by his school to take the program’s admissions test, and hid the acceptance letter upon receiving it last spring at school. When his mother, Kiana Ashburn, 32, found the letter buried at the bottom of his backpack, she waved off his pleas to go to the karate camp she had signed him up for. “You need to get a good education so you can get a good job and have a good future,” she told him that afternoon in their sparely furnished rowhouse in the Fordham neighborhood of the Bronx. She was all the more certain on the Friday before the program started, when the world awakened to a Facebook Live video of an unarmed black cafeteria worker in Minnesota, Philando Castile, bleeding to death in his car after being shot by a police officer. She often made Jonathan repeat what he was to do if he were ever stopped: “Just do what he says, and like, don’t try to resist,” he recited. She thought of math as a field that “usually Asians dominate,’’ she said. It would not protect him from police violence, she knew, or the other things she feared. Her brother had spent time in prison. “But it could act as a buffer,” she remembers thinking. Ms. Ashburn, a postal clerk who graduated last year with a business degree from Monroe College in the Bronx, left before dawn for work on the first day of camp. Jonathan’s sister, Jasmine, a year older than him, was headed to summer school after dropping off their younger brothers at karate camp. Jonathan walked himself around the corner at 7 a. m. to meet his subway group in what would become a daily routine. Omar Pineda Jr. was the counselor assigned to escort them, but it was Emyr Willis, 11, who broke the ice. “Hello,” he greeted them with the formality they would come to see as his trademark. “I am the both the emissary and ambassador from my school. ” Thays Garcia, also 11, was the group’s third member. “I love math,” she said, her face lighting up when asked why she had agreed to spend her summer doing math problems. Her stepfather, Kevin Rincon, who dropped her off each morning, said he had taught himself algebra while serving a prison sentence for a drug felony. Now an account manager at   Mr. Rincon had several years earlier set Thays up with Khan Academy, a widely used service with free online math lessons. As she breezed ahead several grade levels, her friends gave her a nickname that she proudly took on: “Calculator. ” But Khan, Mr. Rincon also knew, was designed to foster basic math literacy, not “the theoretic understanding of exactly what is going on,” as he put it in his email to BEAM. “I want new possibilities and worlds opened for her to see. ” Jonathan did not know it, but he had placed comfortably in the top half of the students admitted to BEAM, who in turn had been drawn from the top quarter of the 400 nominated by schools or parents to take the admissions test. He had spotted patterns and tried solutions that others had not. He had also placed above grade level on New York’s statewide math test, a distinction shared by only 21 percent of the city’s sixth graders, and just 7 percent of sixth graders who are black. He and Thays and Emyr were exactly the kinds of promising students for which BEAM had been created. But it had not been easy to get it going. Some potential supporters objected to devoting resources to   minority students rather than the much larger group performing below grade level. Others voiced perceptions that reflect common stereotypes  —   including the idea that Asians are naturally better at math than anyone else. Sociologists say that misconception exists in part because a high proportion of Asian immigrants to the United States already possess a   degree. They are, in turn, better equipped to steer children toward advanced math programs, as are   scientists and engineers, who are disproportionately white. In interviews, directors of established elite math programs expressed dismay at the way their own enrollments reflect those patterns. Most are nonprofits with limited money, organized by trained mathematicians for the benefit of students whose passion for math often leaves them at the bottom of social hierarchies at school. Some offer scholarships, but most said it was often difficult to find qualified students from underrepresented groups. “We don’t see many applications from blacks and Latinos,” said Glenn Stevens, the director of Program in Mathematics for Young Scientists, a summer math camp for high school students based at Boston University. “I wish I could tell you it was improving,” said Elaine Hansen, the director of the Center for Talented Youth at Johns Hopkins University. “I don’t see that it is. ”   about 15 percent of the   population under 45, obtained about  2 percent of the Ph. D.’s in the fields of math, engineering and physical sciences awarded in 2015, compared to 18. 7 percent in social work and 7. 3 percent of doctoral degrees in all fields, according to the National Science Foundation. (A total of 20 black graduate students received Ph. D’s in math and statistics, out of 1, 802). Hispanics were only marginally better represented. That means whites and   are the   recipients of the tens of billions of dollars in public funding devoted to research in those fields. It also affects   employment: Both Google and Facebook reported last year that Hispanic and black employees together account for only 4 percent of their technical work force. There are other reasons for career disparities beyond who goes to math camp, of course, like the expense of postsecondary education and an effectively segregated public school system that provides   education to many minority students. But the math divide is growing as more white and Asian parents enroll their children, even when they don’t show a knack for numbers, in online math classes and the weekly math circles that have sprouted on university campuses. And the lack of   experiences for black and Latino students, mathematicians and educators say, makes it harder for even high achievers in good schools to compete for spots at the colleges that serve as a springboard for plum jobs in science and technology. “How do you even know a whole bunch of students are supersizing their education and you’re just doing your homework and getting A’s in your A. P. calculus classes?” said Quinton McArthur, M. I. T. ’s associate dean of admissions. “It’s exacerbated the gap and no one even realizes. ” BEAM was founded in 2011 with help from Sandor Lehoczky, a senior trader at Jane Street and a onetime math team champion, who is known for subjecting job applicants to math puzzles. The math whizzes he hires, he said, have been “swimming in a culture of math’’ from an early age. But BEAM’s selective camp for students from   backgrounds who had just completed seventh grade has had mixed results. “Although our students make tremendous progress,” Mr. Zaharopol wrote in a 2015 grant proposal, “it is clear that many of them, even our highest achievers, are still well below their potential. ” BEAM 6, designed for students who have just completed sixth grade, he said, reflected what they had learned: “We need to start earlier and we need to keep them for longer,’’ he said. At BEAM, Jonathan turned the lights off when he walked in and out of classrooms. He sped from one end of the room to another on his rolling chair, popping in on fellow students who were supposed to be working. He seemed more focused on complaining about the lunch food than zeroing in on logic. “Mathematicians love the struggle,” one of the teachers repeated as a kind of mantra when students complained. “When you feel uncomfortable, you’re learning. ” But whether students like Jonathan were having trouble with the math, were unprepared or were simply not trying was a subject of debate. In their weekly faculty meetings, the teachers often marveled at their students’ progress. “I can’t get them to stop doing math,” said Giselle George, who teaches at a public middle school on the Lower East Side. But teaching advanced concepts to students who had not all had the chance to learn certain basic math skills, like the laws of exponents, proved more difficult than some had anticipated. “I find they’re not very good at   when they’re lost or bored,” said another teacher, Marcelle Good. “I guess they’re used to being lost or bored. ” During the program’s second week, Jonathan was a focus for both their hopes and their frustrations. “How do you get kids who haven’t had the exposure the tools to even realize that math is something they like?” Dr. Bernstein lamented. “He’s engageable,” said Michael Pershan, who teaches   math at St. Ann’s, a private school in Brooklyn Heights. “I vote for upping the mathiness. ” “I’m open to suggestions for how to reach him,” said another. “He’s a pretty big distraction in my class. ” Beyond their views, though, there were signs that Jonathan was finding other ways to connect to math. A few days after the challenge problem was posted in the hallway, he was lingering by the snack cart again when Thays arrived. “Hey, Thays,” he said, brightening slightly at the sight of his commuting partner. He had infuriated her that morning by snapping a   picture of her nostrils with his phone, but had quickly redeemed himself by directing her to the sole empty seat on the crowded train. “You going to try it?” she asked, nodding toward the problem. They both knew she had already solved it. (See how she did it in this quiz it’s question No. 5.) He shrugged, looking sideways at her. “Maybe,” he said. By the second week of camp, Jonathan, Emyr and Thays knew the passcodes to one another’s phones so they could trade games. Thays and Jonathan had a running Subway Surfers phone game competition Emyr sought to inspire the others with his passion for Pokemon Go. But they didn’t share everything. Thays did not divulge, for instance, that her biological father, whom she rarely saw, had canceled plans for a trip she was looking forward to later in the summer. His friends did not know that Jonathan’s father was a subway train conductor whom he had last seen about a year ago, in a chance encounter at the 125th street subway station near his school. Emyr did not talk about the bullies who had tormented him in elementary school. But one day on the subway that week, they talked about Black Lives Matter, a subject that held an emotional resonance, at least for Thays and Jonathan. When it came up, it seemed at first that Emyr had not been able to hear the thread of Thays and Jonathan’s conversation over the subway din. Thays, whose parents and stepfather are Dominican, had been to a protest some months earlier with her stepfather. She had written a poem about it. Jonathan had a vivid memory of the video his mother had shown him earlier that month: “There was a kid in the back of the car,” he said, referring to the death of Philando Castile. Trying to translate, I asked Emyr if he had heard of Black Lives Matter. Emyr’s father is Jamaican, his mother Puerto Rican. “No,” Emyr said. “But it’s true. ” Jonathan, looking up from his phone, took the opportunity to fill him in. “How can you not know what Black Lives Matter is?” he demanded. “It’s about how black people are getting killed by cops and it needs to stop. ” Seeking to lighten the trip home that afternoon, Mr. Pineda asked what they recalled of their day. Thays volunteered the simple riddle Dr. Bernstein had asked in her “Codes Codes Codes” class: “I’m thinking of a number from zero to 15. You have to guess my number by asking me four yes or no questions. ” Then Thays added the problem’s final complication: “How many questions does it take if I’m allowed to lie once?” As they deduced the strategy, they were working up to a harder problem, related to Hamming codes, the   codes that underlie digital storage and communications. “There’s also something called binary,” Thays informed Jonathan and Emyr. The girls she had become friends with in that class had agreed that they were all going to BEAM 7, she volunteered. “What about you guys?” “Of course I’m going to BEAM 7,” Emyr said. “J. J. ?” she prodded. But he was peering into his phone. That Jonathan was one of just a few   boys at BEAM (some of the other black students were the children of African or Caribbean immigrants) could have been a fluke. Or it could have been a reflection of the unique forms of discrimination faced by young   males, even in elementary school. BEAM relies on the schools with whom it partners to select which students to take its admissions test, and teachers, studies have shown, pass over qualified black students for gifted programs at higher rates than for whites and Hispanics. Black boys, said Danny Martin, an education professor at the University of Illinois at Chicago, are most subject to the classroom dynamic he calls “Learning Mathematics While Black. ’’ Along with incarceration rates that are higher for young black men than for any other group, that dynamic may contribute to why black women receive a higher share of bachelor’s degrees in math, chemistry and physics, fields in which men of other ethnicities outnumber women. Whatever the reason, many of the   counselors working alongside the teachers at BEAM were paying special attention to Jonathan. One of them was Christian Henderson, an   accounting major at Siena College, in Loudonville, N. Y. “It’s important to educate a kid like J. J. right now,” he said, “so they know in their head they’re on the same level as any white or Asian or Hispanic kid, before they get a little older and they see other people may not think, you know, that’s true. ” Jonathan’s subway counselor, Mr. Pineda, 22, who is part Honduran and part Dominican, told Jonathan how a professor at Amherst College had mentioned that summer math camp had paved the way for many of his wealthy white classmates, whereas he felt lost during his sophomore year in discrete mathematics. A   student at a Harlem high school where the majority of his fellow students were deemed unprepared for college, Mr. Pineda had taken A. P. calculus and secured admission to Amherst with the help of an organization called QuestBridge aimed at matching underrepresented minority students with   colleges. By most measures, he knew, he was a success story. He had just graduated with a degree in math and Japanese studies. But it still bothered him that his classmates, the “summer math nerds,” as he and a friend had taken to calling them, had zoomed ahead. “You should look at this, J. J. ,” Mr. Pineda said on the Thursday afternoon of BEAM’s second week, leafing through his homework folder to a triangular numbers problem. “I think you’d like it. ” The following morning, Thays collapsed in pain at the Columbus Circle subway station as they were waiting for the A train. Emyr paced. Jonathan patted her arm. Mr. Pineda debated what to do. Her stomach hurt, she said. He tried to reach her parents, then called 911. Another counselor met the boys to take them to camp while Mr. Pineda accompanied Thays to the emergency room. When she didn’t come back the next day, or the next, Jonathan railed at Thays’s invisible presence as he, Mr. Pineda and Emyr made the morning commute. “Thays! I know you’re just at home watching TV!” He also found himself thinking about math on the subway, visualizing a problem with triangular numbers and sifting through their patterns. BEAM teachers had explained it as a combination of math and pocket change: A triangular number is the number of pennies required if you’re trying to make a triangle. For instance, if you want your triangle to have 2 pennies to a side, you’ll need 3 pennies total if you want it to have 3 pennies to a side, you need 6 pennies for a triangle of 4 pennies to a side, you need 10. So 3, 6, 10 (and so on) are called the triangular numbers, and Jonathan was in search of the 299th triangular number. With the help of Marquia Williams, a BEAM counselor who was majoring in math at the State University of New York at Oswego, he figured it out, rewarding her with a stifled grin. After nearly a week away, Thays returned  —   her collapse had been caused by an ulcer that required minor surgery  —   to find Jonathan actually sitting still. He even raised his hand once in a while to offer insights in the class they shared. At home on one of the final days, Jonathan’s sister, Jasmine, sat on the steps of their house. She had been attending summer school to catch up in several classes. “How’s that camp going?” she asked. “Are you still behind in your math?” He was silent for a moment. “You know, I’m not at that camp because I’m bad at math,” he said finally. “I’m there because I’m good at math. ” On the last day of program, the BEAM students gathered in a room to receive a graduation certificate. As their names were called, the counselors cheered. An especially loud one erupted for Jonathan. Mr. Zaharopol made a final plug for the online   class he hoped they would take, which started a few weeks after the beginning of school. Each student received a sheet of paper with information about how to log on. BEAM would cover the cost. They would also receive problem sets in the mail, he told them, and he hoped they would send them back. The application for BEAM 7 would come at the end of the year. Emyr was among many who sobbed as the assembly broke up. A few parents had taken up the invitation to attend, including Thays’s stepfather, but he was under strict instructions to drive home on his own. “She wants to go home with her regular group,” he said, shrugging. On the subway, Thays fished in her bag, pulling out a white envelope that she gave to Omar then another that she gave to Emyr, marked with a drawing of his favorite Pokemon character. “You made a slight mistake with the Pikachu,” he noted. “Their eyes are supposed to be black on white. ” “Where’s my present?” Jonathan demanded, as she chatted with Omar. “Come on, Thays. ” Thays let a few more stops go by before relenting. Jonathan tore open the envelope. “Oh special, special JJ,” she had written. “You are so annoying and rude. You always would get me mad and never stopped bothering me. But you always made the train ride fun. You were such a good BEAM friend and I hope to see you in BEAM 7. ” Jonathan paused for a moment before looking up. “Now if you gave me a Nerf gun, it would be better for everyone,” he said, and put his arm around her. The three exchanged phone numbers. A few weeks later, poring over the surveys the students filled out on the last day, Mr. Zaharopol and his staff could take some measure of satisfaction. “I want to get a Ph. D. in math,” one student had written. Neither of his parents had graduated from college. Jonathan, in his review, recommended to future students that they pack their own lunches. He also wrote: “I learned math they don’t teach me at school. ” The teachers, though, wondered how much they’d really been able to achieve. “They’re extremely passionate, and quick to pick up things,” Mr. Zaharopol said in late October, when the BEAM staff gathered for an assessment. “But how many will stick with it? And are we reaching them soon enough?” As police shootings of black men continued and Donald J. Trump moved into the White House, Jonathan’s mother had started to question her belief in the power of math to provide her son with a buffer. “It’s just shocking that his views are the views of a lot of Americans,” she said of the new president. She had allowed Jonathan to take karate after school, and by the start of winter he had obtained his advanced white belt. Jonathan had not heard from Thays, and he was flagging in the online   class for which he had dutifully signed up. Sometimes his internet service, always erratic, would disconnect during the lessons. “I might not be able to do it for a few weeks,” he told me. “I have homework. ” But Emyr noted that all three of their names were on the short list of students who had sent back at least two correct answers to one of the problem sets that BEAM sent home. And one evening, on the top bunk of the bed he shares with his brothers, Jonathan decided to try Thays again. “Hey,” he typed into his phone. “Who is this?” came the reply. “Jonathan from BEAM,” he replied. “J. J. ??!!” Her phone had been broken, she explained. She hadn’t received his texts. They traded messages, until Jonathan’s mother reminded him that his phone privileges had been suspended. “I am grounded for a week, so this is the last time we will be talking for now,” he typed quickly. When the BEAM 7 applications arrived earlier this month, Thays and Emyr set to work. No math problems this time, just questions, 11 of them. What did she want to achieve in the eighth grade? “I want to get into Bronx Science!” Thays wrote, a reference to one of the city’s most selective public high schools. “I mean who doesn’t?” Why did he want to go to BEAM 7? “To see my BEAM peers,” wrote Emyr, in addition to “challenging my brain. ” Jonathan let his application sit on the kitchen table for a week. He let a long snow day with no school pass without looking at it. If he didn’t want to go, his mother had told him, she wouldn’t force him. He could do karate instead. Last Sunday, he began filling in the blanks. What kind of math did he find interesting? However unwittingly, his answer reflected BEAM’s key lesson: “I find proportion problems interesting because I’ll always be confused,” he wrote, “but I figure out the answer anyways. ” On Monday, at work, his mother put it in the mail.	1
599	 Tragedy struck this morning when a 39-year old transgender woman was shot to death in the women’s restroom of Bradford’s Department store in Colorado.The woman, Donna Wright (born Donald Wright), was shot after an altercation with fellow Bradford’s customer, 55-year old Kathleen Workman in the department store’s restroom … no witnesses were available to corroborate Mrs. Workman’s account of the incident, she told authorities that Ms. Wright became confrontational and combative immediately upon being asked to stop following her into the restroom and to use the ‘proper’ restroom.Kathleen Workman told authorities that fearing for her safety, she retrieved a handgun from her purse and once again asked Donna Wright to exit the restroom. According to Mrs. Workman, once she retrieved the concealed weapon from her purse it angered Wright and she began walking towards her in an aggressive manner.According to police reports, it was at this point within the altercation that Kathleen Workman, fearing for her safety, shot Donna Wright 3 times with her Kimber 1911 Ultra .45 caliber handgun striking the assailant in the chest with all 3 shots … According to police reports, due to a lack of witnesses and/or security footage, charges have not been brought against Mrs. Workman and the incident is being ruled as a shooting in self-defense pending further investigation.It was in fact within the transgender woman’s right to utilize the restroom as the Bradford’s management team displays a sign between the women’s and men’s restroom that reads “At Bradford’s we encourage all guests to use the restroom in which they identify with. Thank you, Sincerely, The Bradford’s Management Team.” According to the store manager, senior leadership had requested the sign be created and posted in the restroom area last month after Target announced their new restroom policy.	0

148	LOS ANGELES  —   The St. Francis Dam was a proud symbol of California’s engineering might and elaborate water system  —   until just before midnight on March 12, 1928, when it collapsed, killing more than 400 people in a devastating wall of water. Ever since, the state has had a reputation of diligent inspections as it has built the largest network of major public dams in the nation. But the threat of catastrophic flooding from the damaged Oroville Dam in Northern California this week  —   forcing the evacuation of nearly 200, 000 people because of what environmental groups had asserted in 2005 was a design flaw  —   presented a warning sign for California, where a network of dams and waterways is suffering from age and stress. It also demonstrated that older dams may not be designed to deal with the severe weather patterns California has experienced because of global warming. The Oroville Dam was completed in 1968, toward the end of the golden era of dam building. The culprit at Oroville was a faulty emergency spillway, used for the first time since the dam was opened after days of drenching storms, driven by what are known as atmospheric rivers, that filled the reservoir to capacity. But engineers and environmentalists said similar problems could occur at many of the roughly 1, 500 dams that dot this state. “We are not maintaining the water infrastructure adequately,” said Peter H. Gleick, a founder of the Pacific Institute, a think tank dedicated to water issues. “We are not maintaining it in Flint, Mich. and we are not maintaining it at our big dams in California. We need to spend more money and time on maintaining these. ” Of the 1, 585 dams in California, 17 are listed in poor condition and 97 in fair condition, according to the National Inventory of Dams, which is kept by the United States Army Corps of Engineers. There are about 90, 000 dams across the nation, many of which are privately owned. Part of the problem, officials said, is that as a rule, the government is more inclined to invest money in building new projects, celebrated with elaborate   ceremonies overseen by elected officials, than in the less visible (and less glamorous) task of maintenance. “That is a national concern for us,” said Lori Spragens, the executive director of the Association of State Dam Safety Officials. “Most dams are almost 50 years old. Many of them are very behind in their rehabilitation and they need to be upgraded to current standards. It’s the lack of money. The whole concern with infrastructure is just not there, as we know. ” Climate change adds to the challenges. Scientists have said for years that a warming atmosphere should lead to more intense and frequent storms in many regions. In California, where precipitation in the Sierra Nevada is the source of much of the state’s water, warming also means that more of the moisture in a given storm falls as water and less as snow, adding to the immediate burden on downstream reservoirs. This has been the rainiest year in California’s history, a   turn after a   drought of historic proportions had transformed some reservoirs into brown fields of cracked, dry earth. The wet winter season does not end until April more storms are expected this week across California. And as the state’s vast Sierra Nevada snowpack gradually melts, it will keep feeding reservoirs into the late spring. California has the additional complication of being laced with earthquake faults, which has always been a major challenge to engineers designing dams. Among the dams now considered to be at risk are two that are close to earthquake faults and are undergoing improvements to better withstand seismic shocks: The Anderson Dam and the Calaveras Dam, both near San Jose. But California’s most troubled large dam is at Lake Isabella, built in the 1950s on what was thought to be a dormant earthquake fault by the Army Corps of Engineers on the Kern River above Bakersfield. The fault has since been shown to be active, and out of concerns that the dam could fail, the authorities restricted the level of the lake behind it. This week, officials assured nearby residents that despite heavy rains, the lake levels, and the dam itself, remained safe. But the dam will have to be rebuilt, with a new emergency spillway, at a cost expected to be about half a billion dollars. Construction is expected to start this year and to take at least five years. Isabella is an example of how dam spillways designed more than a   ago are now often inadequate, said Blake P. Tullis, a professor of civil engineering at Utah State University who has worked on the design of the new spillway. Climate change is part of the problem, he said, but other factors, like land use changes  —   more parking lots, for example, mean more runoff into rivers  —   and better weather data have also played a role. “Now, as you do your statistical analysis, the biggest flood you could predict actually happening is much bigger,” Dr. Tullis said. “People are scrambling a bit, asking how we maintain dam safety. ” The problems in Oroville, a community 70 miles north of Sacramento, are particularly unsettling because California has been in the    business for a long time. And no one forgets the lessons of the collapse of St. Francis, whose design was overseen by William Mulholland, a Los Angeles engineer whose career was destroyed by the tragedy. “I would say California is the No. 1 best,” said Joseph D. Countryman, who worked for 20 years as the head of reservoir operations for the Army Corps of Engineers. Still, he added, no matter how much experience or money a   might have, something can always go wrong, especially in a state like this that can go from five years of severe drought to oceans of water falling from the sky. “When you build a dam, you are playing God,” he said. “And it’s tough to be God. ” In the case of Oroville, environmental groups in 2005 opposed the relicensing of the dam by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, saying the emergency spillway should be lined with concrete to ensure its durability if regulators needed to release water to relieve pressure on the dam. The federal agency, backed by the state authority that owns the reservoir, said it was unnecessary. “The management of the dam  —   the management of water  —   is risk management,” said Nancy Vogel, a spokeswoman for the California Natural Resources Agency. “You have to weigh risks and you have to calculate what is a good expenditure and what isn’t. ” Several engineers said it seemed likely that this episode would show the need for something that elected officials have rarely rallied around: spending money on maintenance, rather than new building. The scare came as President Trump has said he will propose some kind of infrastructure program. California has submitted $100 billion worth of projects it would like funded it includes work on the state’s water system, but it is for new work, including raising the Folsom Dam northeast of Sacramento. On Tuesday, Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, said at a news conference that the administration was watching the events in California and that the crisis “was a textbook example of why we need to pursue a major infrastructure package in Congress. ” The events in Oroville are a reminder that everything about a dam  —   from building it to maintaining it  —   is challenging, in no small part because the stakes of a mistake are so high. “Of course it shouldn’t happen,” Mr. Countryman said. “It doesn’t mean it could have been stopped from happening. ” “We went from drought to flood disaster overnight,” he added. “Don’t we get a little break from fearing one thing to fearing another thing?”	1

809	  It is widely believed that many Hallowe’en traditions have evolved from an ancient Celtic festival called Samhain which was Christianised by the early Church. Pronounced sow-in, Samhain is a Gaelic word meaning ‘end of the summer’. This festival is believed to have been a celebration of the end of the harvest, and a time of preparation for the coming winter.It is widely accepted that the early church missionaries chose to hold a festival at this time of year in order to absorb existing native Pagan practices into Christianity, thereby smoothing the conversion process.A letter Pope Gregory I sent to Bishop Mellitus in the 6th century, in which he suggested that existing places of non-Christian worship be adopted and consecrated to serve a Christian purpose, is often provided as supporting evidence of this method of acculturation.Encyclopaedia Britannica states that this date may have been chosen “in an effort to supplant the Pagan holiday with a Christian observance”.The Oxford Dictionary of World Religions also claims that Hallowe’en “absorbed and adopted the Celtic new year festival, the eve and day of Samhain”.However, there are supporters of the view that Hallowe’en, as the eve of All Saints’ Day, originated entirely independently of Samhain and some question the existence of a specific pan-Celtic religious festival which took place on 31st October/1st November.  c.1745, Scottish shortening of Allhallow-even “Eve of All Saints, last night of October” (1550s), the last night of the year in the old Celtic calendar, where it was Old Year’s Night, a night for witches. A pagan holiday given a cursory baptism and sent on its way. Anoka, Minnesota is believed to be the first city in the United States to put on a Halloween celebration to divert its youngsters from Halloween pranks. When Anokans awoke to find their cows roaming Main Street, their windows soaped and their outhouses tipped over, they decided something had to be done.In 1920, George Green and other Anoka civic leaders suggested the idea of a giant celebration. The idea was adopted by the Anoka Commercial Club and the Anoka Kiwanis Club; both giving their full support. In September of that year, a Halloween committee was organized.	0
193	Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the  .) Please note: We will pause for Presidents’ Day and be back on Tuesday. For a couple of weeks each February, Yosemite’s Horsetail Fall puts on a show when the setting sun appears to transform its ribbon of water down the face of El Capitan into glowing lava. That’s if conditions cooperate. The phenomenon only works when the sun is lined up just so, the skies are clear and the mountains are snowy enough to fuel the waterfall. A bit of mist whipped up by the wind helps to get the full effect. Pamela Marcelino, a Postal Service worker in San Francisco, made the drive to Yosemite last Saturday to capture the   firefall. More than 150 other photographers were there, cameras poised, she said. “And you just wait for that moment, holding your breath,” Ms. Marcelino, 41, said. Then, the   glow fades in gradually, peaks and fades out in a matter of roughly 10 minutes. And it’s over. Since last weekend, photographers have been posting dozens of their images to Instagram. Here are a handful that they shared with us: (Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.) • Rain will continue today, with central and southern parts of the state facing heavy rain, flash floods and potential mudslides in some neighborhoods.

[The New York Times] This May marks 80 years since the Golden Gate Bridge opened, but today is a darker anniversary: Eighty years ago, 10 laborers fell from the bridge to their deaths, breaking what Life magazine called a “historic record” of safety at a construction site.

The bridge cost $35 million, or about $590 million in today’s dollars. The bridge’s nearly perfect record was due to the obsession with safety protocols from its chief engineer, Joseph Strauss, along with an innovation he brought that was   in 1930s construction: a safety net to catch falling workers. Nineteen workers fell to the net while the bridge was being built, forming what they called the “Half Way to Hell Club. ” But on Feb. 17, scaffolding on the side of the bridge fell and ripped through the net, taking the 10 laborers with it.

749	 So I keep seeing these posts on Facebook about an Atlanta man who murdered 27 people after getting a heart transplant,  donated from a serial killer. Is this a true or false rumor? A man was arrested this morning in the Georgian capital for the murders of 27 people over the last two years. 54 year-old Michael Rodriguez is accused of killing 23 women and 4 men, slaying at least one victim per month since December 2013.According to his ex-wife, who divorced him in February 2015, the date at which the murders began coincides with Mr Rordiguez’s heart transplant operation. She says that his personality changed dramatically after he got his new heart, and that the operation is responsible for his actions. … The identity of organ donor is often kept secret, but the police investigators were given access to Mr. Rodriguez’s file. They discovered that the organ donor was a convicted serial killer named Dereck Emery, who was executed by the state in 2013.

All characters appearing in the articles in this website — even those based on real people — are entirely fictional and any resemblance between them and any persons, living, dead, or undead is purely a miracle.	0
485	BISMARCK, N. D.  —   About an hour after some 200 police officers cleared the last demonstrators against the Dakota Access Pipeline from their sprawling encampment on the North Dakota prairie last week, Gov. Doug Burgum signed into law four bills aimed at making it easier to control such protests. With a few strokes of a pen, he placed the state in the vanguard of an emerging backlash by conservative forces against political and social advocates who see demonstrations  —   however unruly  —   as free speech protected by the Constitution. In a season rife with demonstrations over immigration, pipelines, abortion, women’s rights and more, Republican legislators in at least 16 states have filed bills intended to make protests more orderly or to toughen penalties against ones that go awry. Republicans in two other states, Massachusetts and North Carolina, have said they will file   bills. Those numbers include only bills whose sponsors have specifically linked them to protests, said Jonathan Griffin, a policy analyst who tracks the measures at the National Conference of State Legislatures. How many will be enacted is unclear a few already have been pronounced dead in committee. Some sociologists and legal experts say the bills are in line with a general trend toward tougher treatment of protesters after especially disruptive demonstrations like the Occupy Wall Street movement in Manhattan and the 2014 violence in Ferguson, Mo. But interviews and news reports suggest that some of the measures are either backed by supporters of President Trump or are responses to demonstrations against him and his policies. After a Nashville motorist struck safety workers who were escorting   protesters at a crosswalk, a Tennessee state representative introduced legislation that would relieve motorists of any liability should they accidentally hit someone deliberately blocking a street. An Iowa bill, filed after about 100   protesters closed Interstate 80 near Iowa City, would make blocking   roads a felony punishable by up to five years in prison and $7, 500 in fines. Similar legislation in Mississippi would impose a fine of up to $10, 000. In Washington State, a Republican senator who helped run Mr. Trump’s campaign there filed legislation that would make it a felony to commit “economic terrorism,” defined as intentionally breaking the law to intimidate private citizens or to obstruct economic activity. A Minnesota bill, responding to protests over the police shooting last year of an   man in a suburb of St. Paul, would allow cities to sue demonstrators who violate the law for the cost of policing their protests. And in North Carolina, a legislator promised to propose a measure making it illegal to “threaten, intimidate or retaliate” against state officials after hecklers denounced Gov. Pat McCrory, a Republican who lost a   bid in November. Those two measures and perhaps others may face constitutional hurdles, said Kevin F. O’Neill, a scholar of protest law at the   College of Law at Cleveland State University. “There’s a First Amendment right of access to sidewalks, public squares and even public streets,” he said. “Heckling is a   First Amendment right. ” But demonstrators who fail to inform authorities of protest plans and locations and to secure a permit are on far shakier legal ground, he added. In those cases, actions like blocking a street would most likely be subject to prosecution. Most of the proposals appear to address protests that lack permits. In many cases, the bills’ sponsors emphasize that they are trying to improve public safety or keep order, not squelch free speech. “We support the First Amendment altogether and want people to get out and do what they want,” said State Senator George B. Gainer, Republican of Florida, who has proposed legislation that would raise fines for blocking traffic and, like the Tennessee measure, indemnify drivers who accidentally hit protesters. “But they shouldn’t endanger themselves or others. ” Some   advocates, however, have their doubts. “There are already laws on the books in states that say if you break something or harm somebody, you’re going to be prosecuted,” said Patrick F. Gillham, a sociologist at Western Washington University who studies protests. “They’re troubling. They potentially have a chilling effect on protest. ” In Georgia, where the State Senate has passed legislation toughening the penalty for obstructing traffic, Worth Bishop, a volunteer for the   movement Indivisible, said the proliferation of   bills took aim at the First Amendment. “These laws are clearly designed to abridge the right of the people to lawful assembly,” Mr. Bishop said. He called the proposals “intimidation from the right,” saying there was scant demand for the measures from the police. In North Dakota, legislators rejected a bill similar to Tennessee’s that would have shielded motorists. But they enacted measures that expand the criminal trespass law, raise penalties for riot offenses, criminalize wearing masks and hoods while violating the law, and make it easier for    police officers to assist local authorities during events like protests. Kyle Kirchmeier, the sheriff in Morton County, N. D. where the main protest camp was, cast the measures as needed additions to existing laws that were insufficient to contain the huge   demonstrations. “As this went along,” he said, “there was definitely areas in the law that we’ve seen that weren’t fitting, especially when people tie themselves to equipment and that type of thing. ” But demonstrators and civil liberties advocates sense a dark ulterior motive, and describe the new North Dakota measures as thinly veiled attempts to quell dissent and criminalize protest. The bills passed the   legislature with large majorities, and took effect immediately after the governor signed them. “They’re looking for clever ways to send chilling effects,” said Chase Iron Eyes, a prominent pipeline protester and recent congressional candidate who was charged with inciting a riot after a February arrest. “The state will try to devise ways to squash opposition and chill the will of people who are willing to face risks to their liberty to further their cause. ” Opposition to the Dakota Access pipeline led to a remarkable mobilization of activists, many of them Native American, who spent months camped out demanding a halt to construction. The gathering drew international headlines, prompted violent clashes with law enforcement and led to the mobilization of the National Guard and the installation of razor wire and roadblocks on rural byways. In North Dakota, a rural state with a large energy industry where gatherings of such magnitude were unprecedented, the protests exhausted police resources and brought unwelcome scrutiny. “You have something that’s chewing up tens of millions of dollars of extra law enforcement cost that we don’t have,” said Mr. Burgum, a Republican who took office in December when tensions were at a fever pitch, and who ordered the evacuation of the main camp last week. Mr. Burgum, a   politician, earned praise for taking a more   approach in meeting with tribal officials and protesters, and for arranging for the state to cover the cost of bus tickets and meals for    demonstrators who needed help getting home. Kelly Armstrong, a state senator and the chairman of the North Dakota Republican Party, said the political environment in the state was sympathetic to law enforcement, and concerned about the monetary and reputational cost of the protests. “For the most part, everyone in North Dakota was about ready for this to be over about two weeks after this started,” Mr. Armstrong said. “The politics of it, there’s not really an upside to being a    politician,” he added, using initials for the pipeline. But in that context, civil liberties advocates see the new   laws as especially dangerous. Jennifer Cook, policy director of the American Civil Liberties Union of North Dakota, said there was a “concentrated effort to criminalize protests” in the state and that the new laws were “masked as ways to protect public safety. ” “We know that the bills were inspired by the events down in Morton County,” Ms. Cook said, “and that they are focused on preventing protesters from protesting, essentially. ”	1

519	 The Republican war on women continues unabated. The same week that conservatives argued in the Supreme Court that employers should be able to stop their employees from getting contraception outside of the company health plan, Indiana joined the ranks of states like Texas and Florida in passing a draconian law that purports to protect women, while in fact, endangering their health by making safe abortion much harder to get. And Gov. Mike Pence recently signed it. The bill is stuffed with as many asinine restrictions on abortion with an eye towards making abortion as miserable and humiliating an experience as possible, and ideally something women can’t get legally at all.… Pence also tried to offer his opinion on what would have happened had he allowed rape victims to still have abortion. “First and foremost, because this is such a sensitive topic, let me just say that I sympathize with rape victims not just in America, but around the world. I can only imagine what it must be like to experience such trauma,” he said. “However, that does not justify murder, not even that justifies murdering a baby, not in my book. Because what would happen? We’d then have an epidemic of women claiming to have been raped just so they could have an abortion. And that has to be stopped at all cost.”Donald Trump’s new running mate also said, “Basically, if I’d have said no on the bill, that would be just like giving out get-pregnant-without-fear cards, because at the end of the day, women could have unprotected sex without worrying about what they’d do in the event of pregnancy. And you know, it’s not supposed to be like that … And it gets worse — when you get an abortion, you get several days off of work and whatnot to recover. And there are a lot of crazy people out there. What if women would go out and get raped on purpose just so they could get off work? I mean, Indiana’s economy is struggling as it is, and having thousands of women absent from their jobs would be horrific for the state, I’m telling you. I made the right call and that will be confirmed in the long run,” Pence concluded.	0

540	 More tragic news out of Baltimore as 2-year-old Malik Gibson was shot by Baltimore police officer Greg Browning after Browning mistook the pacifier in Gibson’s hand for a handgun. Browning’s report of the incident was released earlier today. It stated:“I had been called to the apartment building for a domestic disturbance. When I got there, the adjacent apartment had their door open. There was a black male sitting on the floor. He said something to me in a hostile manner. Something like, ‘go away!’ I could tell that he was going to be aggressive. When I saw him reach for the object, I knew it was going to be him or me. My kind is Not welcomed in these kind of neighborhoods.” The object in question turned out to be Gibson’s pacifier and the door had been opened because the apartment’s superintendent had not yet fixed the apartment’s air conditioner so Gibson’s mother was letting a cool breeze in. She was on the phone watching Gibson from the kitchen. She apparently couldn’t see who he was talking to, but stated that, “if she had known it was the police, she would have closed her door immediately and took her child to sit in the bathtub with her until everything settled down.”… Meanwhile, conservative talk show host Bradley Stanley has come out stating that Gibson was indeed “a thug with a long rap sheet which included having a potty mouth and not eating his vegetables so there’s no doubt that Gibson was talking back to the officer who was in fear of his life.”	0
555	 The terrorist attack at an Orlando, Florida, nightclub has “impacted” the thinking of Marco Rubio “about a lot of things,” the Florida senator said Monday, including making him “think a little bit about your service to your country and where you can be most useful to your country.” During an interview with Hugh Hewitt on Monday morning, the conservative radio host urged the former Republican presidential candidate to change his mind and seek re-election for his Senate seat.… the Florida senator attempted to point the blame to President Barack Obama and current Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. “It’s very simple. If those poor people had guns on them at the time of the incident, one of them might have managed to shoot the assailant once or several times, which could have ended the entire thing before all those people died. So if the friends and families of the deceased want someone to point the finger to, it should be our president and his second-in-command. Because I hold them directly responsible, as should they.”Rubio went on to claim that “it was God’s will that those people died,” and that God was the one who made it happen “because He had no other way of telling me how much He needs me back in the Senate.” “You’re well aware of the state of things in America today, Hugh,” the senator continued. “Do you really think that man decided to kill 50 people and wound as many just because of the spur of the moment? No, that was a higher power in action. That higher power is God, and that was His way of getting a message down to me. Well, I’m here to tell Him that His message was received loud and clear.”	0
150	Dr. James Weinstein, a back pain specialist and chief executive of   Health System, has some advice for most people with lower back pain: Take two aspirin and don’t call me in the morning. On Monday, the American College of Physicians published updated guidelines that say much the same. In making the new recommendations for the treatment of most people with lower back pain, the group is bucking what many doctors do and changing its previous guidelines, which called for medication as   therapy. Dr. Nitin Damle, president of the group’s board of regents and a practicing internist, said pills, even    pain relievers and   should not be the first choice. “We need to look at therapies that are nonpharmacological first,” he said. “That is a change. ” The recommendations come as the United States is struggling with an epidemic of opioid addiction that often begins with a simple prescription for ailments like back pain. In recent years, a number of states have enacted measures aimed at curbing prescription painkillers. The problem has also led many doctors around the country to reassess prescribing practices. The group did not address surgery. Its focus was on noninvasive treatment. The new guidelines said that doctors should avoid prescribing opioid painkillers for relief of back pain and suggested that before patients try   or muscle relaxants, they should try alternative therapies like exercise, acupuncture, massage therapy or yoga. Doctors should reassure their patients that they will get better no matter what treatment they try, the group said. The guidelines also said that steroid injections were not helpful, and neither was acetaminophen, like Tylenol, although other    pain relievers like aspirin, naproxen or ibuprofen could provide some relief. Dr. Weinstein, who was not an author of the guidelines, said patients have to stay active and wait it out. “Back pain has a natural course that does not require intervention,” he said. In fact, for most of the people with acute back pain  —   defined as present for four weeks or less that does not radiate down the leg  —   there is no need to see a doctor at all, said Dr. Rick Deyo, a spine researcher and professor at the Oregon Health and Science University in Portland, Ore. and an author of the new guidelines. “For acute back pain, the analogy is to the common cold,” Dr. Deyo said. “It is very common and very annoying when it happens. But most of the time it will not result in anything major or serious. ” Even those with chronic back pain  —   lasting at least 12 weeks  —   should start with nonpharmacological treatments, the guidelines say. If patients still want medication, they can try    drugs like ibuprofen or aspirin. Scans, like an M. R. I. for diagnosis are worse than useless for back pain patients, members of the group said in telephone interviews. The results can be misleading, showing what look like abnormalities that actually are not related to the pain. Measures that help patients get back to their usual routines can help along the way, as Sommer Kleweno Walley, 43, of Seattle, can attest. Last spring, she slipped on the stairs in her house and fell down hard, on her back. “After a couple of hours I could barely walk,” she said. “I was in real pain. ” She saw a physical therapist, but the pain persisted. Eleven days later, she showed up at the office of Dr. Christopher J. Standaert, a spine specialist at the University of Washington and Harborview Medical Center. She expected to receive an M. R. I. at least, and maybe a drug for pain. But Dr. Standaert told her an M. R. I. would not make any difference in her diagnosis or recovery and that the main thing was to keep active. She ended up getting   medication and doing physical therapy. A few months later, her back stopped hurting. It is surprising, some experts in back pain say, how often patients are helped by treatments that are not medical, even by a placebo that patients are told at the start is really a placebo. Dr. Standaert cited a study in which patients with chronic low back pain were offered a placebo, and were told it was a placebo, along with their usual treatment  —   often an   drug like ibuprofen or naproxen. Or, the patients remained with their usual treatment alone. Those taking the placebo reported less pain and disability than those in the control group who did not take it. The placebo effect, although modest, was about the same as the effect in studies testing nonpharmacological treatments for back pain like acupuncture, massage or chiropractic manipulations. Many people with chronic back pain tend to shut down, avoiding their usual activities, afraid of making things worse, Dr. Standaert said. Helping them is not a matter of prescribing drugs but rather teaching them to set goals and work toward returning to an active life, even if they still have pain. “They have to believe their life can get better,” Dr. Standaert said. “They have to believe they can get to a better state. ” The question is: Will the new guidelines be adopted? “Patients are looking for a cure,” said Dr. Steven J. Atlas, a back pain specialist at Massachusetts General Hospital, who wrote an editorial accompanying the article on the new recommendations. “The guidelines are for managing pain. ” Added to the problem are the incentives that push doctors and patients toward medications, scans and injections, Dr. Deyo said. “There is marketing from professional organizations and from industry,” he said. “‘We have the cure. You can expect to be cured. You can expect to be pain free. ’” Medical insurance also contributes to the treatment problem, back experts say, because it does not pay for remedies like mindfulness training or chiropractic manipulations which, Dr. Deyo added, “are not cheap. ” Even if doctors want to recommend such treatments, there is no easy referral system, Dr. Atlas said. “It is much easier at Mass General to get a shot than to get a   or cognitive behavioral therapy,” he added. Dr. Weinstein has a prescription: “What we need to do is to stop medicalizing symptoms,” he said. Pills are not going to make people better and as for other treatments, he said, “yoga and tai chi, all those things are wonderful, but why not just go back to your normal activities?” “I know your back hurts, but go run, be active, instead of taking a pill. ”	1
345	Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the  .) Today’s introduction comes to us from Adam Popescu, a reporter based in Los Angeles.  In turning the Trayvon Martin tragedy into a virtual reality film, the director Nonny de la Peña combed through public court records and stitched together 911 calls to structure an auditory narrative of the rainy night that ended in the shooting death of the unarmed    by George Zimmerman. To get the look of the apartment complex in Sanford, Fla. where the events took place, Ms. de la Peña, a former Newsweek correspondent who runs a virtual reality company in Santa Monica, found architectural drawings of the location online, designs that were then rendered as video   C. G. I. models. The final product, called “One Dark Night,” was recently shown at Los Angeles’ Hammer Museum and is now available on Google Play and Steam. “This is immersive journalism,” she said, intended to drive empathy. But it also raises issues about taste and truth. I caught up with Ms. de la Peña by phone. Here are some excerpts from the conversation: Q. How did this piece come together? A. “One Dark Night” is sourced entirely from 911 calls, trial testimony and architectural drawings of the condo complex where the shooting took place. I’m still an investigative journalist at heart, and it was very much the kind of story I used to cover as a print reporter. I really wanted to make a piece about the shooting, to be able to cast any kind of additional spotlight on the case using V. R. Q. Why Trayvon Martin? Why not Freddie Gray or another tragedy? A. Nothing other than I had the ability and I had the time and I felt I was the person to do it. Something clicked when I began investigating the Trayvon case. Q. You say it’s meant to draw empathy. Do you acknowledge that videos of shootings can be interpreted in multiple ways, and that this piece is subject to such questions? A. Definitely. I’ve had a journalist say that they better understood Zimmerman’s position. We’re always trying to figure out what we can convey to the viewer and what’s appropriate to show. For audiences not reading newspapers or watching broadcast TV, V. R. can reach them where they play. This is how you keep an informed global citizenry and keep democracy robust. What do we decide to shield them from? I think that that question is only going to be more pronounced as this media becomes more mature.

Years of drought put a damper on the foraging of fungus in the state’s forests, a hobby that has burgeoned with the growing popularity of fresh, local food. Amateur clubs up and down the state are organized around both the culinary and scientific celebration of California’s many mushroom species. As the rainfall began to surge last October, so did the autumn mushrooms, said Debbie Viess, a   of the Bay Area Mycological Society. “We had a tremendous year for porcinis,” she said, “and it’s been a really good year for chanterelles too. ” Even with the continuing rain, several mushroom experts were wary about making predictions for the spring season, when popular morel mushrooms are normally abundant. While water is necessary, it isn’t sufficient, said Patrick Hamilton, a longtime mushroom picker in Sonoma County. “There are so many things, from soil conditions, to climatic conditions, to the age of the trees, all these things are difficult to understand,” he said. But the mystery, he added, “is part of the fun. ” California Today goes live at 6 a. m. Pacific time weekdays. Tell us what you want to see: CAtoday@nytimes. com.

348	President Trump’s sweeping new immigration policies  —   which include efforts to shine a harsh national spotlight on cities that released undocumented immigrants who went on to be accused of serious crimes  —   are sharply increasing the legal and political risks confronting local law enforcement officials. As Mr. Trump ratchets up the pressure on   sanctuary cities through what some advocates are denouncing as a “  ” campaign to force them to work more closely with federal immigration authorities, police and sheriff’s departments are being caught in a crossfire. In Denver, Sheriff Patrick Firman, who runs the local jail, has long received one set of instructions from the   city government and local advocates. The city attorney warned him against detaining anyone without a warrant. The American Civil Liberties Union threatened to sue him if he did. Immigrants’ rights groups applied the added deterrent of local political pressure. So Mr. Firman’s department began doing what many law enforcement officers around the country have learned to do: balance contradictory requests. When the federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency wants to deport one of his inmates, the jail sends a fax notifying ICE before the inmate is about to walk free  —   leaving it to federal agents to show up and make an arrest. But the fax is not necessarily sent with a great deal of advance notice. In the case of Ever Valles, 19, a Mexican national awaiting trial for car theft, the Denver jail’s fax was sent in the middle of the night in late December, 10 hours after Mr. Valles posted bail but less than a   before he walked free. ICE was nowhere to be seen. Last Friday, Mr. Valles was charged with a much more serious crime: murdering a man at a light rail station in a robbery gone awry. Now, Mr. Firman is in the eye of a political storm that highlights the precarious position confronting many law enforcement officials. Immigration officials accused Mr. Firman of ignoring their detainer request. “Had the officer for ICE been sitting at the fax machine, waiting for it to come in, it still would not have been enough time for us to come and get him,” said Shawn Neudauer, an ICE spokesman. The Fox News host Bill O’Reilly declared that Mr. Firman and Denver’s mayor had “blood on their hands. ” Angry messages quickly began flooding the sheriff’s department and its social media pages. Mr. Firman declined to be interviewed. Officials at the jail, which releases about 100 people a day and receives three to five detainer requests a week, say they try their best to cooperate with immigration officials and to notify them in a timely manner, despite calls from local advocates not to communicate with the agency and to release undocumented immigrants through a side door to elude federal agents. The Trump administration hopes the firestorm will help shift public opinion in cities that have vowed to protect their undocumented populations. Yet, the attacks on Mr. Firman do not acknowledge the confusing and often conflicting rules that have led to complaints by the law enforcement agents. United States appeals courts have ruled that federal detainer requests are not a substitute for a warrant or for the probable cause required to get one. “You can’t just pick up the phone and say, ‘Please hold an individual,’” said Jonathan F. Thompson, executive director of the   National Sheriffs’ Association. When federal officials began issuing detainers in 2008 under a pilot program called Secure Communities, most jurisdictions treated the requests as mandatory. But after American citizens were mistakenly held, filed suit and won costly damage awards, some jurisdictions stopped cooperating. More confusion occurred when cities and states adopted their own policies spelling out when to turn over undocumented immigrants. As compliance with detainers dropped sharply, the Obama administration ended the program and introduced a new one allowing local jurisdictions far more leeway to decide when to cooperate. But that has caused even more confusion among law enforcement officials, when what they want is clarity about their obligations, Mr. Thompson said. He said his members were relieved this week when Mr. Trump reinstated the Secure Communities program. But Mr. Thompson said the rules surrounding federal detainers were still “a work in progress. ” It remains to be seen how the reinstated program will avoid the same legal setbacks that took the program down under President Obama. “We’re all trying to figure out how to do that as quickly as possible,” Mr. Thompson said, mentioning a meeting he and some of his members had recently with Mr. Trump. Recent clashes between local and federal officials have only muddied the waters. In New York City this week, ICE officials publicly assailed the city government after an undocumented Salvadoran teenager with suspected ties to a violent gang, Estivan Rafael Marques Velasquez, was released from Rikers Island despite a federal request for assistance with his deportation. “Honoring a detainer request is not about politics,” Thomas R. Decker, director of enforcement and removal operations for ICE in New York, said in a news release. “It is about keeping New York citizens safe. ” But the city’s mayor, Bill de Blasio, vigorously defends that policy, adopted by the City Council in 2014, under which only those accused of 170 serious felonies  —   such as arson, robbery or homicide  —   can be turned over to immigration enforcement agents. And in a radio interview last month, the mayor suggested that turning local police into a deportation force would make the city more dangerous because fewer people would report crimes or cooperate with investigations. “If so many of our fellow New Yorkers who are undocumented feared to communicate with the local authorities because they thought they might be deported, we couldn’t run our city,” he said. The case of Mr. Velasquez, 18, who has been arrested six times since 2014 on charges that remain sealed because he was a minor at the time, highlights how quickly public opinion can shift if an undocumented immigrant commits a serious crime. A trenchant New York Post headline  —   “ ‘Sanctuary City’ Law Let Gang Member Walk Free From Rikers”  —   lit up social media as Trump supporters across the country railed against New York’s defiance. The prospect of more such cases being publicized has rattled New York officials. “I don’t think that litigating this in the public sphere is the best path forward,” said Nisha Agarwal, the city’s commissioner for immigrant affairs. Mr. Velasquez  —   known to city officials as Steven Marquez  —   was involved in a clash last year between youths outside Queens County Criminal Courthouse witnesses told investigators they heard gunshots. He was charged with felony weapons possession, which would have made him eligible to be handed over to ICE under New York City’s policy. But he pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor,   weapons possession. He served less than a year at Rikers Island, where investigators noted that he had a tattoo associating him with the Salvadoran gang  . On Feb. 16, he was released from jail. Hours later, he was rearrested by federal agents at a Queens apartment, according to ICE, whose agents say it is far more dangerous to arrest someone on the streets than in jail. To highlight the additional risks they say they must take in sanctuary cities, ICE agents make a point of issuing news releases that criticize jurisdictions that decline to cooperate with deportations. That kind of   warfare is almost certain to escalate. This week, the Department of Homeland Security ordered Immigration and Customs Enforcement to release weekly reports of crimes committed by immigrants who were the subjects of detainer requests that went ignored. Some sanctuary cities view the move as beyond the pale. “This is a shaming list, a scarlet letter that the federal government is going to put on jurisdictions around the country,” said Dennis Herrera, San Francisco’s city attorney. “We welcome an open and honest discussion about immigration and crime, because numerous studies have shown that immigrants are less likely to commit serious crimes or be incarcerated than   individuals. ” But Mr. Thompson, of the National Sheriffs’ Association, said the effort was merely meant to illuminate the constraints under which law enforcement agencies are operating. The new directive “wasn’t written in a way to shame anyone,” he said. “It was written in a way to give the department a handle on, ‘Why can’t these criminal aliens be held? Is it state law or local law preventing a sheriff from cooperating? ’”	1
369	MEXICO CITY  —   With a panel of senators questioning him, the billionaire investor Wilbur L. Ross stayed on message: If confirmed as President Trump’s commerce secretary, he would protect American workers and tear up bad trade deals that harmed American industry. And yet, for more than a decade, those same trade deals helped Mr. Ross amass a fortune across the globe  —   in countries like Mexico and China, among others. In fact, Mr. Ross has sometimes invested overseas in ways that Mr. Trump condemns. As the head of an auto parts company, Mr. Ross shipped jobs to Mexico, taking advantage of the North American Free Trade Agreement, which he now says is unfair and must be renegotiated. That company, along with a textile firm he founded, publicly stated that Mexico was central to their growth. To some of his former associates, that history clangs against the persistent message of Mr. Trump, who has called Nafta “the single worst trade deal ever approved in this country” and has excoriated American businesses for sending jobs overseas. But a spokesman for Mr. Ross described his experience as an asset, not a contradiction. “As a private businessman, Mr. Ross made pragmatic decisions based on the rules of the road at the time  and it is precisely his knowledge of how trade deals work that will allow him to be successful in renegotiating bad deals like Nafta,” said the spokesman, James Rockas. The Senate is scheduled to vote on Mr. Ross’s confirmation on Monday. Mr. Ross’s flexible approach to trade is characteristic of many private equity barons focused on the bottom line, his former associates say. After taking over two bankrupt American textile makers more than a decade ago, for instance, Mr. Ross paid a visit to an executive of J. C. Penney Company. The industry was in turmoil, and Mr. Ross needed advice. Fellow mill owners, largely concentrated in the American Southeast, were blaming free trade for destroying their livelihoods. Many felt that sending jobs overseas, even for survival, was tantamount to treason. But for Mr. Ross, who made his name fixing bankrupt companies across a variety of American industries, hiring workers abroad made sense, former associates say. So Mr. Ross inquired about opening a mill with hundreds of workers  —   not in the United States, but in Vietnam. “He struck me as very practical about trade,” recounted Peter McGrath, the former head of product development for J. C. Penney, who offered Mr. Ross advice. “He was on a different part of the curve than a lot of his competitors. ” Just over a year later, in 2006, Mr. Ross announced plans to open an $80 million     cotton plant in Vietnam that would employ 1, 500 workers. It was one of many business decisions Mr. Ross made over the years that seemed to depart from Mr. Trump’s stance against   deals and the migration of jobs overseas. “I don’t think he is a devious person,” Jock Nash, a retired lobbyist for Milliken  Company, a textile manufacturer, said of Mr. Ross. “Anybody that knows how to make money is opportunistic  —   and they have to be to make money. ” Having been tapped by Mr. Trump to lead the charge on America’s worldwide trade relationships, Mr. Ross, 79, has adapted once more. In his new role, if confirmed, he will be tasked with increasing American exports to help create jobs in America. First and foremost, he told members of Congress, he would focus on Nafta. “We cannot afford trade that is inherently bad for American workers and for American businesses,” Mr. Ross said during his testimony. His measured comments have taken a back seat to Mr. Trump’s more vocal broadsides against the auto industry for its investments in Mexico, often via Twitter. Mr. Ross has argued that investment in Mexico hurts American economic growth, bolstering the Mexican economy while reducing investment in the United States. But Mr. Ross has made extensive investments in the auto industry south of the American border. His entry into Mexico began in 2007, a year after he began buying up the global assets of struggling American auto parts makers. He combined them into International Automotive Components, a supplier of auto interiors with factories around the world, including in Mexico and China. Sales in 2015 reached $5. 9 billion. Nearly a decade ago, when his company announced the purchase of a plant in Hermosillo, Mexico, adding $300 million in sales and 1, 700 employees to its payroll, Mr. Ross said the deal “demonstrates our commitment to expansion in   countries. ” Eight years later, just before Mr. Trump began his presidential campaign, the company inaugurated a brand new plant, its eighth operation in Mexico. By then, Mr. Ross’s company had completed expansions at three other plants in Mexico. The future there looked bright: His company cited a forecast that Mexico would account for 25 percent of the world’s growth in auto production. Mr. Ross acknowledged in the hearing that he had moved “a couple of hundred” jobs to Mexico, saying an automaker had demanded the shift. But he began transferring work to Mexico in the early days of his business. When Mr. Ross acquired an auto parts factory in Carlisle, Pa. a decade ago, he took a hard line with the union, demanding cuts in wages and benefits worth between a quarter and 30 percent of workers’ earnings, according to Doug Carey, who was the president of Local 1739 of   which represented many of the workers. When the union rejected the demand, Mr. Ross shut the plant down, moving the work to North Carolina, Canada and Mexico, Mr. Carey said. “Wilbur Ross  —   there’s no way he cares about the worker,” said Stacey Foltz, who worked at the plant for 10 years. “He made billions of dollars taking jobs out of the country. ” In other cases, even when a plant stayed open, Mr. Ross transferred production to Mexico. In 2007, after Mr. Ross acquired 11 plants from Lear Corporation that were represented by the United Automobile Workers, their bargaining committees flew to Detroit to meet him. Over lunch, they said, they listened to his pitch for turning the company around, which involved cuts to their salaries and benefits. “All the U. A. W. plants gave concessions,” said Richie Franklin, the bargaining chairman for Local 2999 in Strasburg, Va. “It was a tough pill to swallow. ” Though grateful to Mr. Ross for turning the company around, Mr. Franklin was frustrated to see jobs vanish. Two years after the workers agreed to the cuts, Mr. Ross’s company moved the production of consoles for General Motors trucks to Mexico, leaving 110 people out of work. “They just did it, and there was nothing we could do,” Mr. Franklin said. In the world of textiles, Mr. Ross used a playbook developed over years. He scoured for companies in distress. Before long, he purchased two textile makers in North Carolina: Cone Mills and Burlington Mills. At the time, the industry was in upheaval. Textile and clothing manufacturers were bleeding money and jobs. Cheaper wages in Asia brought a surge of imports that helped wipe out nearly   of the industry, experts say. Finding a way forward for Mr. Ross’s company, the International Textile Group, would require cheap labor in Mexico and elsewhere. “I think he was one who recognized that Burlington wouldn’t survive without that kind of diversification of production,” said Patrick Conway, an economics professor at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. “It is the same juxtaposition you would see with Trump hiring foreign workers for his casinos while talking about building a wall. ” “It is a compartmentalization of the businessman’s mind,” he added. Mr. Ross began lobbying for another trade deal, one that would essentially incorporate Central America into a   zone like Nafta. According to people familiar with the negotiations, he became one of the biggest proponents of the Central American Free Trade Agreement, or Cafta. He became a mediator of sorts between textile makers like himself and retailers like Walmart and J. C. Penney, whose priority was giving consumers low prices, not using American fabrics. While Cafta has failed to prevent an onslaught of Chinese imported goods, Mexico remains a crucial element of the company Mr. Ross built.   of the International Textile Group’s revenue is generated by two factories in Mexico, and in its 2015 annual report, published when Mr. Ross was still in charge, the company was clear where the future lay  —   not in the United States, but in Mexico and China. “I. T. G. ’s   focus includes realizing the benefits of its global expansion, including reaching full production at the company’s facilities in China,” the company said in its report. As for Mexico, the report stated that because the company was a “resident, diversified textile product manufacturer in Mexico,” it “believes that Nafta is generally advantageous. ” Mr. Ross sold the International Textile Group in October to another private equity firm. For all the choices Mr. Ross made to open factories abroad or lay people off domestically, most who knew him during that era say he was not a heartless Wall Street tycoon. He kept jobs where he could in the United States, including in Greensboro, N. C. where the company maintains a denim mill. Bruce Raynor, a former union leader in the textile and auto parts industries, said Mr. Ross was not   as many of his Wall Street contemporaries were. Over the years, Mr. Raynor sat across the table from Mr. Ross on numerous occasions, whether negotiating contracts for textile workers or for auto parts workers. “It was a low bar to be a decent guy, but as a distressed investor, you buy things that are not doing well,” said Mr. Raynor, who now runs a consulting business. “By definition, if you represent workers, and this is a company in trouble, it’s not like those transactions are fun. ” “Wilbur was always very decent to work with,” he added. “You can’t say that about too many of these guys. ” Perhaps most telling, he said, was the investment Mr. Ross made in the Amalgamated Bank, a nearly    institution founded by the nation’s unions. In the depths of the financial crisis, Mr. Raynor asked Mr. Ross for a bailout. Having worked with Mr. Ross for years, he asked whether the businessman would be interested in making an investment of $50 million, the largest the bank would allow. After months of due diligence, the deal went through, Mr. Raynor said, which he believes was a testament to Mr. Ross’s decency  —   not greed. He said Mr. Ross could have made more lucrative investments, but opted instead to help the unions. “‘I want to make money, but I’m not under any illusions and I’m not in a hurry,’” he said Mr. Ross had told him.	1

This is the full transcript. Secretary Clinton received $225,000 for this speech.HILLARY CLINTON: Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you very much, Lloyd [Blankfein], and thanks to everyone at Goldman Sachs for welcoming me today. I’m delighted to be back among friends, colleagues, collaborators, supporters, kindred spirits…Let me jump right in. You know, over the past few months, there have been popular concerns about an economy that still isn’t delivering for the majority of Americans. It’s not “delivering” the way that they feel it should, that they feel entitled to. Most Americans that you speak to, speak a populist rhetoric that claims it is stacked for those at the top, that those of you here have it too good.(Laughter)But we know the hopes that the little people have for their future — things like school, job, food, clothing on their backs– all of those little things would not be possible without your leadership and innovation. BSNews, in stark contrast, is here to tell you the truth. We pride ourselves on covering the news stories the corporate media won’t dare touch. We will from time to time take satirical side swipes at journalists within the MSM (see Special Reports) and we will be producing spoof media animations (see Podcast) but we will never deliberately lie or mislead OUR audience about the most important news stories of the day. At another town hall, on Feb. 18, a man in the audience pleaded, “Please, just release those transcripts so that we know exactly where you stand.” Mrs. Clinton had told him, “I am happy to release anything I have when everybody else does the same, because every other candidate in this race has given speeches to private groups.”	0
111	WASHINGTON  —   Just days into his new position as President Trump’s national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn found himself in a meeting that any White House official would dread. Face to face with F. B. I. agents, he was grilled about a phone call he had had with Russia’s ambassador. What exactly Mr. Flynn said has not been disclosed, but current and former government officials said on Tuesday that investigators had come away believing that he was not entirely forthcoming. Soon after, the acting attorney general decided to notify the White House, setting in motion a chain of events that cost Mr. Flynn his job and thrust Mr. Trump’s fledgling administration into a fresh crisis. Mr. Flynn’s rise and fall followed familiar patterns in Washington, where ambitious figures secure positions of great authority only to lose them in a blizzard of contradictions, recriminations and scandal. But rarely has an official at such a high level risen and fallen in such a dizzyingly short time, in this case just 24 days after Mr. Flynn arrived in the West Wing to take his corner office. Given his short stay at the top, Mr. Flynn’s case might be quickly forgotten as an isolated episode if it did not raise other questions, particularly about what the president knew and when. Even more broadly, it underscores lingering uncertainty about the relationship between the Trump administration and Vladimir V. Putin’s Russia, a subject of great interest given American intelligence reports of Moscow’s intervention in last year’s elections in the United States. As leaders of both parties said on Tuesday that they expected the Senate to investigate and probably even summon Mr. Flynn to testify, more details emerged about a drama that played out largely in secret inside a White House riven by competing power centers. Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, revealed that Mr. Trump had known about concerns that Mr. Flynn lied for more than two weeks before demanding his resignation on Monday night. But Vice President Mike Pence was kept in the dark and did not learn that Mr. Flynn had misled him about his Russia contacts until reading news accounts late last week. Mr. Spicer described a deliberative process in which a new president took his time deciding what to do with Mr. Flynn, a retired   general who played a major role in his campaign. The issue, Mr. Spicer said, was not about legality but credibility. “The evolving and eroding level of trust as a result of this situation and a series of other questionable instances is what led the president to ask for General Flynn’s resignation,” he said. But other aides privately said that Mr. Trump, while annoyed at Mr. Flynn, might not have pushed him out had the situation not attracted such attention from the news media. Instead, according to three people close to Mr. Trump, the president made the decision to cast aside Mr. Flynn in a flash, the catalyst being a news alert of a coming article about the matter. “Yeah, it’s time,” Mr. Trump told one of his advisers. Until around that point, Mr. Flynn seemed to think he was going to keep his job. He told The Daily Caller, a conservative news site, on Monday that he had not violated the law. “If I did, believe me, the F. B. I. would be down my throat, my clearances would be pulled,” he said. “There were no lines crossed. ” But by that evening, he was writing a resignation letter, admitting no deception, only that he had “inadvertently” passed along “incomplete information. ” The issue traced back to a call last December between Mr. Flynn, then on tap to become Mr. Trump’s national security adviser, and Sergey I. Kislyak, the Russian ambassador to the United States. President Barack Obama was imposing new sanctions on Russia and expelling 35 diplomats after the election meddling. The day after the sanctions were announced, Mr. Putin said Russia would not retaliate in kind, as has been the custom in the long, tortured history of   relations, instead waiting for a new administration that he assumed would be friendlier. Inside the Obama administration, officials were stunned. Mr. Trump publicly welcomed the decision. “Great move on delay (by V. Putin),” he wrote on Twitter. “I always knew he was very smart!” Around the same time, Obama advisers heard separately from the F. B. I. about Mr. Flynn’s conversation with Mr. Kislyak, whose calls were routinely monitored by American intelligence agencies that track Russian diplomats. The Obama advisers grew suspicious that perhaps there had been a secret deal between the incoming team and Moscow, which could violate the rarely enforced,    Logan Act barring private citizens from negotiating with foreign powers in disputes with the United States. The Obama officials asked the F. B. I. if a quid pro quo had been discussed on the call, and the answer came back no, according to one of the officials, who like others asked not to be named discussing delicate communications. The topic of sanctions came up, they were told, but there was no deal. On Jan. 12, David Ignatius, a columnist for The Washington Post, reported that Mr. Flynn had called Mr. Kislyak, setting off news media interest in what was said. Mr. Spicer, then the spokesman for Mr. Trump’s transition team, went to Mr. Flynn, who he said told him that sanctions had not come up during the call. Briefing reporters the next day, Mr. Spicer repeated the misinformation, saying that the conversation had “never touched on the sanctions. ” Mr. Flynn told the same thing to Mr. Pence and Reince Priebus, the incoming White House chief of staff, who were scheduled to go on the Sunday talk shows and expected that they would be asked about the matter, according to the two men. On Jan. 15, Mr. Pence went on “Face the Nation” on CBS and on “Fox News Sunday” and repeated that sanctions had not been discussed, while Mr. Priebus said much the same on “Meet the Press” on NBC. The topic came up again after Mr. Trump and his team moved into the White House. At his first full briefing on Jan. 23, Mr. Spicer said that Mr. Flynn’s conversation had touched on only four subjects, none of them sanctions. That caught the attention of the F. B. I. and the Justice Department. Sally Q. Yates, an Obama appointee held over as acting attorney general until Mr. Trump’s choice was confirmed, concluded that the disparity between what was said on the call and what Mr. Flynn had evidently told the vice president and others about it might make the new national security adviser vulnerable to blackmail. When foreign governments hold information that could prove embarrassing, it is considered a potential leverage point. Soon after the Jan. 23 briefing, James B. Comey, the F. B. I. director, sent agents to interview Mr. Flynn. If he told the agents what he said publicly for more than a week after that interview  —   that his conversations with the ambassador had been innocuous and did not involve sanctions  —   then he could face legal trouble. If the authorities concluded that he knowingly lied to the F. B. I. it could expose him to a felony charge. It was not clear whether Mr. Flynn had a lawyer for his interview or whether anyone at the White House knew the interview was happening. But they knew afterward because Ms. Yates, with the support of Mr. Comey, reached out to Donald F. McGahn II, the new White House counsel, on Jan. 26 to give him what Mr. Spicer called a “heads up” about the discrepancy. Mr. Trump was told “immediately,” Mr. Spicer said, and directed Mr. McGahn to look into the matter. After an “extensive review” that lasted several days, Mr. McGahn concluded that nothing in the conversation had violated federal law, Mr. Spicer said. But the president then set out to determine whether he could still trust Mr. Flynn. Mr. Spicer said Mr. Flynn stuck to his original account, making matters worse. “We got to a point not based on a legal issue, but based on a trust issue, with the level of trust between the president and General Flynn had eroded to the point where he felt he had to make a change,” Mr. Spicer said. “The president was very concerned that General Flynn had misled the vice president and others. ” Asked if Mr. Trump had instructed Mr. Flynn to talk about sanctions with Mr. Kislyak, Mr. Spicer said, “No, absolutely not. ” Asked if Mr. Trump knew that the issue had come up before the Justice Department told the White House, Mr. Spicer said, “No, he was not aware. ” Mr. Spicer emphasized that there was “nothing wrong” with Mr. Flynn’s talking with representatives of other countries to prepare for the new president taking office, and that, in fact, Mr. Trump wanted him to. By that point, Mr. Trump’s relationship with Mr. Flynn had grown more awkward. One person close to the president, who asked to remain anonymous to describe private discussions, said Mr. Trump had been “uncomfortable” with Mr. Flynn for weeks. Jared Kushner, the president’s    and senior adviser, had expressed concern about Mr. Flynn’s appointment even before the inauguration, according to another person briefed on the discussions. Mr. Trump’s views were coming around to the same point. “What he knew was that Flynn was too much about Flynn, versus Mattis,” the person close to the president said. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis was seen as deferential to the chain of command. “He loves Mattis because Mattis is respectful and  . ” Another key figure with growing concerns about Mr. Flynn was Stephen K. Bannon, the president’s chief strategist whom Mr. Flynn perceived as a rival for control over national security. Mr. Trump began asking Mr. Mattis about two weeks ago for suggestions of possible replacements for Mr. Flynn. The defense secretary recommended retired Vice Adm. Robert S. Harward. Mr. Bannon reached out to Mr. Harward last week, two senior officials said. The situation escalated late Thursday when word reached the White House that The Washington Post was reporting that the transcript of Mr. Flynn’s call showed that he had discussed sanctions, contrary to his assurances to Mr. Pence and others. White House officials confronted Mr. Flynn, who only then said that it was possible they had come up, but that he did not remember. “His story remained the same until that night,” Mr. Spicer said. “That’s when his response changed. ” That was also when Mr. Pence first learned that the Justice Department had proof that Mr. Flynn had not told the truth and had warned the White House two weeks earlier, according to Marc Lotter, his spokesman. “He did an inquiry based on those media accounts,” Mr. Lotter added, without elaborating. Another person who speaks frequently with him said Mr. Pence went “ballistic,” or at least what qualifies as ballistic for the coolheaded vice president. Mr. Pence, Mr. Priebus and Mr. Bannon urged Mr. Trump to fire the national security adviser, according to officials, but the president could not bring himself to do it, in part for fear of losing face. When a reporter on Air Force One heading to Florida on Friday asked him about The Post’s report, Mr. Trump said he had not read it. “I don’t know about that,” he said. “I haven’t seen it. ” As late as Monday, he was sticking by Mr. Flynn. He sent his counselor, Kellyanne Conway, to tell a television interviewer that he had “full confidence” in Mr. Flynn. And Mr. Flynn phoned a reporter for The Daily Caller on Monday to say the president had “expressed confidence” in him and urged him to “go out and talk more. ” In that interview, posted on Tuesday, Mr. Flynn said he had discussed the Russian diplomats’ expulsion with Mr. Kislyak. “It wasn’t about sanctions,” he said. “It was about the 35 guys who were thrown out. ” Mr. Flynn added: “It was basically, ‘Look, I know this happened. We’ll review everything.’ I never said anything such as, ‘We’re going to review sanctions,’ or anything like that. ” Either way, it was too late. When the matter came to overshadow the president’s   meeting with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada and word arrived of another Post article on Ms. Yates’s warning to the White House, Mr. Trump ordered an end to the situation. “He made a determination late in the day,” Mr. Spicer said, “and he executed on it. ”	1

53	As soon as I walked into Celia Rojas’s prekindergarten class in Union City, N. J. I was sucked in by the hum of activity. Art plastered the walls, plants were hanging from the ceiling, and in every nook there was something to seize a child’s imagination. Some kids were doing cutouts of paper clothing and others were at an easel, painting. A bunch of children were solving puzzles on a computer, while another group was building a pink cardboard chair, which they called “A Chair for My Mother. ” In the reading nook a girl was learning about how, when the wasp larva hatches, it eats the spider. Three classmates were playing   trying on old felt hats and checking themselves out in the mirror. The teacher was everywhere  —   praising kids, offering suggestions when they were stumped and, sometimes, peacemaking. Two boys were peering at insects through a microscope when they started fighting over who got to look next. Ms. Rojas deftly diverted them. “How many parts does an insect body have?” she asked. The boys knew: “Three parts  —   the antenna, abdomen and legs. ” “How about an insect salad  —   would you want to eat it?” she inquired. “Ugh,” the boys chorused. “Why not  —   are they bad for you?” she asked. The boys thought about it. “Maybe if you chopped them up they’d be O. K.,” one volunteered. At that moment I wished that I were 4 years old and could join the festivities. But most   classrooms look entirely different. After surveying preschools nationwide, Robert Pianta, dean of the University of Virginia Curry School of Education, concluded that “superficial task demands, including giving directions and assigning routine tasks, predominate over children’s involvement in appropriate conceptual or   activities. ” A preschool in Chicago that I visited a few years earlier boasted that it was certified by the National Association for the Education of Young Children, the   equivalent of the Good Housekeeping seal. But it didn’t merit that encomium. A big room that might once have been a storeroom had been split into   each about 15 feet square, separated by   partitions. Noise reverberated throughout the building. “Stay within the lines,” a teacher commanded a    boy. “You’re not tracing the triangle. ” After he started coloring, she returned, exasperated. “You weren’t paying attention during circle time. Only color the triangles, not the circle or the heart. ” The teacher turned to me. “I like the kids when they stay within the lines and color beautiful,” she said. In another class, children were told to paint the bottom section of a pyramid. The directions were the same: Stay within the lines. It turned out that the kids were painting the food pyramid, but they didn’t know that’s what they were doing. What I saw made me wish that I could round up a passel of children and make a run for safety. Deborah Stipek, a professor of education at Stanford, makes the point more bluntly: “What I see in a lot of preschools is much worse than coloring between the lines. It’s teachers yelling at kids all day. ” These two prekindergartens serve very different populations, but perhaps not the ones you might expect. The “stay within the lines”   enrolls mainly   youngsters, whose parents pay to send them there, while Ms. Rojas’s classroom is in a public school in a poor immigrant community. Though I’ve spent many hours crouching in these classrooms, I’m no expert. What I witnessed should be obvious to any mom or dad. That’s why, even if you are an   parent, you can rapidly determine whether you want to send your child to a particular preschool. You may also be able to save a boatload of money, since public preschools are often as good as their $30, 000 alternatives. When you walk in the door of a prekindergarten, check out the walls  —   they should be festooned with children’s projects, and not, as is too often the case, plastered with posters that are calculated to please adults and mounted too high for    to see. Look around. There should be lots of different things for children to do. If the kids say hello, and quickly return to what they have been doing, that’s a good sign, for it suggests that they’re developing social skills. But if they mob you, you have your answer: This isn’t the place for your child. You might consider yourself to be a fascinating person, but you shouldn’t be more interesting than whatever activity these   and    are engaged in. Is the class   silent? I’ve talked with    parents who equate obedience with quality, but unless you want your child in boot camp, that’s unhealthy. (Of course, running wild isn’t a good thing either that   energy belongs on the playground.) Kids should be quiet, if a bit squirmy, during circle time, when they are gathered around their teacher. But mostly they should be engaged with one another, because that’s when most learning occurs. Their teacher should be talking with them, not at them. And if the classroom looks like a healthy mix of kids from different backgrounds, that’s all to the good. Children learn a lot from their classmates, and kids with different experiences have much to contribute to one another. That’s it, more or less. If you have a chance to talk briefly with the teacher, ask her how she decides to spend time with one group or another. Inquire about how she handles children who haven’t fully learned how, as the argot goes, to use their words, take turns or share. While the answer matters, you mostly want to make sure she has really thought about those things. Winging it doesn’t make for good teaching. I imagine many readers believe that I’ve committed heresy. To them, Montessori or HighScope, Reggio Emilia or Waldorf, or some other school of   pedagogy embodies the Holy Grail. But there’s no reason to believe that one of these is better than the others. The key is how well a particular model of teaching is being carried out. A class can be a joy when the teacher truly understands how properly to use, say, the HighScope approach, which has the children decide what they want to do that day, then tackle the chosen project and later review what they’ve learned. But these techniques are devilishly hard to pull off. When done badly the result is a mighty mess. That’s why the school district in the first example allows the best teachers to design a curriculum that, while borrowing from   approaches, makes the most sense for their kids. For parents, the bottom line is simple: Watch closely what’s happening in the classroom, pick a preschool that you wish you had gone to, and your child will do just fine.	1

527	 A teen was tragically shot dead on Sunday after trespassing onto private property while attempting to catch a Pokemon in the new game “Pokemon Go” … According to [the] report, 15-year-old Arthur Disby apparently left his house on Sunday around 1 a.m., with a friend who was staying over, when the two friends noted a rare Pokemon had appeared in the nearby Pokemon list. The two friends reportedly left the house without notifying adults, and started searching the neighborhood for the rare Pokemon. The friends apparently thought they had pinpointed the rare Pokemon, but could not get close enough to it, because it seemed to be inside a neighborhood home.The deceased teenager’s friend reports that Arthur first circled the residence, triggering security lights as he attempted to get the Pokemon to appear. He then walked into an enclosed back porch of the residence, and when it still did not appear he started checking windows on the house and attempted to open them.Homeowner Ellen Jones, a 47-year-old widow who lived by herself in the home, was awoken by the sound of someone trying to open her bedroom window … The widow panicked and shot at the teen twice, striking him both times.The teenager was transported to an area hospital with two gunshot wounds to the chest where he subsequently died from the injuries.Then police department issued a statement that people should play the game sensibly and respect private property boundaries at all times.

668	 During a weekend interview, CNN challenged pro-life Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio on his statement during last week’s Republican debate about posing abortion in cases of rape or incest. The Florida senator didn’t back down from his pro-life position. Host George Stephanopoulos said, “You also got called out by Jeb Bush and Chris Christie on the issue of abortion because you don’t support exceptions for rape and incest.” Rubio replied, “Well, first of all, I do require an exception for the life of the mother because I’m pro-life. Number two, I – as I’ve said, if they pass a law in Congress that has exceptions, I’ll sign it because I want to save lives. The broader point I’ve made, however, is I believe all human life is worthy of the protection of our laws.”… Rubio continued, “What I’m trying to say here is that God created all of us in His image for a reason, and despite the selfishness that is raging through the majority of our population, I believe He put us humans on this Earth to protect and preserve life, not to kill it before it’s even had a chance to start. We are committing murder and we are going to go to Hell for it. And let me just add, I do not believe – let me say that again: I DO NOT believe in abortion, because that’s equal to murder in my book. If God were to intentionally infect a baby in the womb with the Zika virus, for example – I would still forbid the mother to have an abortion and use it to avoid God’s judgment. That’s how adamant I am when it comes to people’s right to freedom and existence.” Newslo is the first hybrid News/Satire platform on the web.

16	When Jeff Hornacek took the job as the Knicks coach last May, he did so with eyes wide open. He was not oblivious to the dysfunction that has been a part of the organization for years. He expected some controversy or another with the Knicks. Roughly nine months into his tenure, the team has not fallen short of Hornacek’s expectations. “It’s lived up to the billing,” he said Wednesday before the Knicks fell,   to the Los Angeles Clippers. “It’s been something out here. ” But even Hornacek could not have expected that the game that night would dissolve into a   circus. While a feud continues to stew between the Knicks president Phil Jackson and the team’s top star, Carmelo Anthony, amid   struggles, their game ceded the spotlight Wednesday night to a courtside fracas. Charles Oakley, the voluble but beloved former Knicks stalwart, was arrested after getting into an altercation with security guards midway through the first quarter. Oakley was removed from Madison Square Garden and handcuffed. Oakley was sitting courtside, in an aisle seat in the first row of the section near the Knicks’ bench. Accounts of his behavior varied widely. According to some spectators seated nearby, he had been calm early in the game. He took a photograph with Felice Bergman, a fan with season tickets several rows higher. James L. Dolan, the Knicks’ owner, with whom Oakley has a contentious relationship, sat nearby, but several spectators said they did not see Oakley exchange any words with Dolan or try to provoke him. But they did see Oakley exchanging glances with a security guard who was standing several feet away. Oakley seemed to utter something to the guard when he walked by, according to T. J. Veenstra, who was sitting behind Oakley. A guard soon came over to Oakley and asked him to leave. Oakley asked why. “He just couldn’t understand why,” said Matthew Barbara, who sat a few rows up from Oakley. “We didn’t see him throw a punch or do anything. He wasn’t nasty to any of the people behind him. We’re trying to figure out what happened. ” Oakley was soon surrounded by a phalanx of guards, as John McEnroe, the former tennis champion, stood behind them on the court watching. As they tried to remove Oakley, he pushed one guard twice before being restrained and taken away. The game, which was still in its early stages, stopped as players from both teams watched the commotion. As he was being led out, the crowd chanted: “Oakley! Oakley!” Knicks guard Derrick Rose later said: “That was the weirdest. I didn’t know what was going on. ” The police said Oakley had been charged with three counts of   assault and one count of criminal trespass, all misdemeanors. He was released with an appearance ticket. The Knicks, in a statement, said Oakley had behaved in a “highly inappropriate and completely abusive manner. ” But fans sitting nearby said they did not feel that was the case. “Nothing he did rose to the level of what happened,” Jamie Vitiello said. “They overacted. ” The episode was a distraction from another Knicks quarrel. The previous day, Jackson had posted a message on Twitter that seemed to endorse a Bleacher Report story painting Anthony as a star who did not have a sufficient will to win and who was more interested in building his brand and his own statistics. It was another shot in a feud between Jackson and Anthony that has persisted all season. After the game, Anthony was asked if he still trusted Jackson. “I did say that,” Anthony said, adding: “I trust the process. ” Anthony and Jackson have met twice to calm the waters. In December, Jackson said Anthony was a   on offense. In January, Charley Rosen, a longtime confidante of Jackson’s, wrote a column on FanRag Sports that said Anthony had “outlived his usefulness in New York. ” And for the last several weeks, Anthony has heard his name in trade rumors as the Knicks have reportedly tried to trade him, to teams including the Clippers. Anthony, however, has a   clause in his contract and has not indicated that he wants to leave the organization. Jackson, however, did try to play peacekeeper in the Knicks’ other contentious situation on Wednesday. After Oakley was taken away from his seat, Jackson rushed out to the tunnel to try to calm him. But Oakley continued to fume as he stood outside the court with his hands in cuffs and guards surrounding him. “I didn’t do nothing,” he said, mixing in expletives. He said Dolan was responsible  —   although he did not say for what. Oakley has had a conflicted relationship with the Knicks. He was a fan favorite during his 10 seasons with the team. He was known for his rugged and physical style and helped take them to the 1994 N. B. A. Finals. Yet, he has been exiled over the last few years after a falling out with the organization. While many of his former teammates returned to Madison Square Garden, Oakley had not. “The boss don’t like me,” Oakley told The New York Times last fall. He said he has tried to meet with Dolan but has been rebuffed. “I mean, I had at least 15 people try to set up a meeting,” Oakley said. “He won’t meet. I want to sit down to talk to him. I want me and him in a room. And lock the door. Lock that door!” On Wednesday, however, they shared an arena  —   one that had once been the setting for Oakley’s glory days. When he was eclipsed by security guards, Doc Rivers, the Clippers coach and a former teammate, immediately recognized him at the center. “That was tough to watch,” Rivers said.	1
71	Al Jarreau, a versatile vocalist who sold millions of records and won a string of Grammys for his work in pop and RB as well as his first love, jazz, died on Sunday in Los Angeles. He was 76. His death was announced by his manager, Joe Gordon, who said that Mr. Jarreau had been hospitalized for exhaustion two weeks ago. On the advice of his doctors, he had canceled his tour dates and retired from touring. Mr. Jarreau did not begin a   musical career until he was nearly 30, but within a few years he had begun attracting notice for a vocal style that was both instantly appealing and highly unusual. Critics were particularly taken by his improvisational dexterity, in particular his virtuosic ability to produce an array of vocalizations ranging from delicious nonsense to clicks and growls to   sounds. Although he made his initial mark in the jazz world, Mr. Jarreau’s style, and his audience, crossed stylistic barriers. His music incorporated elements of pop, soul, gospel, Latin and other genres. It was a mark of his eclecticism that he won six Grammys across three different categories: jazz, pop and RB. He was also among the performers on a   children’s album, “In Harmony: A Sesame Street Record. ” If Mr. Jarreau’s highly accessible, intensely personal style defied easy classification, that very accessibility  —   and, perhaps, the mere fact of his considerable commercial success  —   left some jazz purists skeptical. Reviewing a concert by Mr. Jarreau at the Savoy in New York in 1981, Stephen Holden of The New York Times encapsulated what many saw as both the pros and the cons of Mr. Jarreau’s singular style: “Al Jarreau may be the most technically gifted singer working in   today,” Mr. Holden wrote. Of the evening’s performance, however, he continued: “Mr. Jarreau’s concert lacked the emotional range of great jazz. He is such a prodigious talent that the absence of even the slightest blues inflections kept his music from cutting deeply. ” But critics’ reservations never deterred Mr. Jarreau, who prided himself, as he told The Los Angeles Times in 1986, on his “jazz attitude,” which he defined as “the idea of being open to each and every moment as a chance to create something different. ” “I try to be receptive,” he added, “and to be listening, and to not be afraid to try something new. ” Alwin Lopez Jarreau was born in Milwaukee on March 12, 1940, into a musical family. His father, a minister, was a fine singer his mother played the piano in church. Young Al began singing at 4, harmonizing with his siblings. As a youth he sang in church, as well as with   harmony groups and local jazz bands. Mr. Jarreau earned a bachelor’s degree in psychology from Ripon College in Wisconsin in 1962, and a master’s in vocational rehabilitation from the University of Iowa in 1964. Afterward he moved to San Francisco, where he worked as a rehabilitation counselor for people with disabilities. But Mr. Jarreau found he could not resist the pull of jazz and before long was singing in local nightclubs. By the late ’60s, he had quit his day job and embarked on a nightclub career, first on the West Coast and eventually in New York. He reached a national audience with the album “We Got By,” released by Warner Bros. in 1975 to critical praise and commercial success. Though advertised as his debut, it was actually his second album. A decade earlier, Mr. Jarreau had quietly recorded an album, later released on the Bainbridge label under the title “1965. ” Though Mr. Jarreau took legal action, without success, to block its belated release in 1982, it is esteemed by jazz connoisseurs today. Appearances on “Saturday Night Live” and other television shows raised his profile, as did extensive touring. In 1981 he had his biggest hit with the song “We’re in This Love Together,” which reached No. 15 on the Billboard pop singles chart. He won his first Grammy in 1978, for best jazz vocal performance, for his album “Look to the Rainbow. ” He won his last in 2007, for best traditional RB vocal performance the award was shared by Mr. Jarreau, George Benson and Jill Scott for their collaborative performance “God Bless the Child. ” In between, in 1982, Mr. Jarreau earned a Grammy for best pop vocal performance by a male artist for the title track of his album “Breakin’ Away. ” That year, he also received the Grammy for best jazz vocal performance by a male artist, for his version of Dave Brubeck’s “Blue Rondo à la Turk,” from the same album. His other Grammys came in 1979 for the album “All Fly Home” (in the jazz category) and in 1993 for the album “Heaven and Earth” (in RB). A seventh Grammy came in 1981 for “In Harmony: A Sesame Street Record,” a compilation children’s album that featured a range of artists. Among Mr. Jarreau’s   recordings was the theme song for the   television series “Moonlighting,” for which he wrote the lyrics to Lee Holdridge’s music. He appeared on Broadway as a replacement in the role of the Teen Angel in the 1994 revival of “Grease. ” Mr. Jarreau’s first marriage, to Phyllis Hall, ended in divorce. He is survived by his wife, the former Susan Player a son, Ryan two brothers, Marshall and Appie and a sister, Rose Marie Freeman. Mr. Jarreau canceled a number of concert dates in 2010 after experiencing heart and breathing problems during a European tour. He was hospitalized for 11 days but resumed his touring schedule after his release, and had continued to perform until recently. Shortly after his 2010 hospitalization, he said in an interview that his health problems had not been as serious as reports suggested, but joked that he appreciated the attention they received in the media because it proved that he was a celebrity. “I figured,” he said, “ ‘Yeah, maybe I have arrived.’ ”	1
178	The United States attorney’s office is looking into the way Fox News handled payments related to sexual harassment cases to determine whether the company misled investors, according to the lawyer for a woman who is suing the network. At a hearing in New York State Supreme Court on Wednesday, the lawyer, Judd Burstein, who is representing the former Fox anchor Andrea Tantaros, said that another one of his clients had received a grand jury subpoena related to Fox News. He did not identify that client. Mr. Burstein said in a text message that he believed federal investigators were looking at whether Fox News structured sexual harassment settlement claims by paying them out in salaries, “so as not to have to report them. ” He added that the prosecutors had identified themselves as being from a securities fraud division of the United States attorney’s office in Manhattan. In a statement, Fox News said it had not received a subpoena but had “been in communication with the U. S. attorney’s office for months. ” The statement added that Fox “will continue to cooperate on all inquiries with any interested authorities. ” The United States attorney’s office declined to comment. The prospect of a criminal investigation is a surprising escalation of the sexual harassment scandal that engulfed Fox News over the summer and led to the departure of its chairman, Roger Ailes. After reaching a $20 million settlement with Gretchen Carlson, a former anchor who sued Mr. Ailes, and conducting an internal investigation into his conduct, the company tried hard to put the episode behind it. The scope of the investigation by the United States attorney’s office, which appeared to be in the early stages, was not immediately clear. Mr. Burstein made the remarks while he was arguing that Ms. Tantaros’s case  —   she sued the network in August, accusing Fox News of retaliation after she complained about sexual harassment  —   should go forward in an open court. A judge rejected that claim on Wednesday and ruled that her case would be resolved in arbitration. In a statement, a spokeswoman for Fox News said, “The court granted Fox News’s motion to send Andrea Tantaros’s case to arbitration, where it always belonged, and rejected her counsel Judd Burstein’s histrionics. ” Asked whether Mr. Ailes had received a subpoena, Susan Estrich, his lawyer, declined to comment. Mr. Ailes has denied the sexual harassment allegations. Ms. Tantaros’s suit asserts that the network’s newsroom resembled “a   Playboy   cult. ” The suit named a number of Fox News executives in addition to Mr. Ailes, accusing them of marginalizing her and removing her from the air after she complained. Fox News denied the charges, saying that Ms. Tantaros was let go for violating her contract by writing a book without approval. In July, Ms. Carlson sued Mr. Ailes for sexual harassment. Fox News’s parent company, 21st Century Fox, hired the law firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton  Garrison to conduct an investigation, and a number of other women stepped forward with similar accusations, including the former Fox star Megyn Kelly.	1
536	 After opening fire at the presumptive Republican presidential candidate, Ginsberg turned to her own plans should Donald Trump actually become the new President of the United States. “There’s no need to beat around the bush, so I’m just going to go ahead and say it – I will resign my position as a Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States if that happens. I cannot imagine performing my duties under the constant pressure of waking up in the morning and having to go to work knowing that every ruling we as an institution make will be viewed through the prism of a Trump presidency. I can tolerate this charade of a presidential campaign, but I could not live with him as president,” she said. This is HYBRID site of news and satire. part of our stories already happens, part, not yet. NOT all of our stories are true! “I don’t want to think about that possibility, but if it should be, then everything is up for grabs,” Ginsburg told The Associated Press in an interview published Friday.But the leader of the court’s liberal wing didn’t sound too concerned about the possibility — referring to the next president with the pronoun “she.”“It’s likely that the next president, whoever she will be, will have a few appointments to make,” Ginsburg, told the AP, a thinly veiled reference to presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.	0
217	SEOUL, South Korea  —   China said on Saturday that it was suspending all imports of coal from North Korea as part of its effort to enact United Nations Security Council sanctions aimed at stopping the country’s nuclear weapons and   program. The ban takes effect on Sunday and will last until the end of the year, the Chinese Commerce Ministry said in a brief statement posted on its website on Saturday. Chinese trade and aid have long been a vital economic crutch for North Korea, and the decision strips North Korea of one of its most important sources of foreign currency. Coal has accounted for 34 percent to 40 percent of North Korean exports in the past several years, and almost all of it was shipped to China, according to South Korean government estimates. The ban comes six days after the North Korean test of a ballistic missile that the Security Council condemned as a violation of its resolutions that prohibited the country from developing and testing ballistic missile technology. In the test, North Korea claimed that it had successfully launched a new type of   missile. It said its     missile used a   technology that American experts say will make it harder to detect missile attacks from the North. In the resolution it adopted in November in response to the North’s fifth and most powerful nuclear test, the Security Council said that North Korea should not be allowed to export more than 7. 5 million metric tons of coal a year or bring in more than $400 million in coal sales, whichever limit is met first. It was unclear whether that cap has already been reached for this year. Officials of the United States and its allies, including President Trump, have suggested that China, North Korea’s principal economic patron, should be more aggressive in enforcing sanctions. But while it does not approve of the North’s weapons program, China has also been seen as reluctant to inflict crippling pain on North Korea, for fear that it might destabilize its Communist neighbor. In April, China announced that it would ban coal imports from North Korea as part of the United Nations’ efforts to squeeze the country’s ability to raise funds for its nuclear and missile programs. But it allowed exemptions for coal imports for “livelihood” reasons, and deliveries continued. The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not comment on the suspension after it was announced on Saturday. Calls to the ministry’s press officer were not answered. On Friday, the Chinese minister of foreign affairs, Wang Yi, said at a conference in Munich that the United Nations sanctions of North Korea “must continue to be strictly implemented. ” But Mr. Wang also argued that only renewed negotiations would offer any hope of curtailing North Korea’s nuclear weapons development. China has hosted   talks  —   including itself, South Korea, North Korea, the United States, Japan and Russia  —   aimed at a negotiated settlement of the North Korean nuclear standoff. But those talks have stopped since 2009, and there seems little hope of them restarting anytime soon. “This situation cannot continue,” Mr. Wang said, “because the ultimate outcome may be intolerable to all sides. ” Last year, China imported 22. 5 million metric tons of coal from North Korea, an increase of 14. 5 percent on the amount in 2015, according to Chinese customs statistics. In December, China imported about 2 million tons of North Korean coal. Mysteel, a Chinese industrial analysis firm, estimated that under the limits imposed by the sanctions, the coal quota would be used up by April or May. In 2015, China’s cumulative imports of North Korean coal reached 7. 5 million metric tons by May. The coal suspension also followed the assassination of Kim   the estranged half brother of the North Korean leader Kim   on Monday at an airport in Malaysia. The Malaysian authorities are continuing to investigate the case. South Korean officials have suspected North Korean involvement in the killing of Mr. Kim, who had been living in Macau, the Chinese gambling enclave. Some analysts have speculated that the killing may have infuriated Beijing because Mr. Kim was considered a   candidate to replace Kim   the North Korean leader, should the current government in North Korea fall.	1
575	 A shocking report coming out of the Indian University of Science in Bengaluru, Karnataka announces they have successfully cloned a half human, half gorilla hybrid. Gorilla and human genetic experimentation has been going on secretly since the 1980s, in multiple countries. It was only inevitable that the success of these experiments would finally take place. They are calling him ‘Hurilla.’ At just seven weeks of age, ‘Hurilla’ weighs approximately 18.2 pounds and is 24 inches long; They expect him to grow to approximately 250 – 300 pounds with a height not to exceed 6 feet. A baby gorilla has been born at a wildlife park in Florida.The primate’s arrival caused a lot of drama at Busch Gardens zoological hospital.After an examination of his mum Kishina, 33, vets were worried about the baby’s welfare and was delivered by “a very rare” emergency caesarean.	0

254	MALIBU, Calif.  —   The golf shoes on display in a back room at Nobu Malibu, a restaurant overlooking the Pacific Ocean, would have looked at home in the nearby Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles. They were artwork for the sole, pairs of shoes adorned with leis, plaid, a California grizzly bear and numbers  —   notable scores and finishes that marked steps in the ascent of Jordan Spieth’s career. The Spieth One shoes available soon at an Under Armour retail outlet near you are not at all like the decorative footwear that caught the eye of those at the United States introduction of Spieth’s new spikes. The Spieth One is distinctive in ways that do not catch the eye: the springiness, the snug heel support and the wide placement of the spikes for better stability. Even the stylistic elements  —   vertical and horizontal lines that Spieth requested from the designers  —   emphasize utility. “That’s going to help me when I look down and I’m trying to line up,” Spieth said. “But it also looks cool. It’s a cool way to be subtle because I don’t want a giant J. S. on there. ” Be it his signature shoe or his life, Spieth prefers form over flash. Just as his golfing attire leans toward grays, blues, browns and whites, his public persona leans toward vanilla malted. Except for Spieth’s results, nothing about him screams “Look at me!” That made Nobu, where the beautiful people go to be seen while grazing on yellowtail sashimi, a novel place for Spieth, 23, to promote the shoe last Monday. The day before, Spieth had held his first   lead on the PGA Tour since flubbing the 2016 Masters, and this one he converted into his ninth tour title. His   victory, at the ATT Pebble Beach   was just what the psychologist had ordered for Spieth, who hoped he would not have to return to Augusta National in April weighed down by the baggage of the   lead squandered in last year’s final round. “It was definitely in the back of my head all day,” Spieth said. He added: “You have that voice in your head that says: ‘Who cares what anybody else says or thinks? We just do what we do.’ But, obviously, that round was going to be on my brain because it was the most recent lead that we had. If I didn’t hold this one, what kind of repercussions would that have?” Having exorcised the ghost of leads lost, Spieth could have slept in the next morning, enjoyed a   day, and then luxuriated in the rave reviews of his new shoes that night. Instead, he was out at Riviera Country Club in Pacific Palisades, Calif. when the sun came up, playing in the Collegiate Showcase with amateur partners who included the heralded Texas senior Gavin Hall. Spieth was accompanied by his coach, Cameron McCormick, who took videos of his swing to review between shots. Spieth, who dropped out of Texas early in his sophomore year to turn pro, said he was striking the ball as well as he did in 2015, when he came close to winning the first three legs of golf’s Grand Slam. He posted 27 consecutive rounds under par in stroke play until his    third round Sunday at the   Genesis Open, where he finished tied for 22nd at six under, 11 strokes off the lead. But you would never know he was striking so well from watching him prepare. In his practice rounds, he bemoaned approach shots that found the green but were more than 10 feet from the pin and lamented drives that were not perfectly struck but nevertheless found the fairway. Last month, Spieth played a   round with another Under Armour athlete, the swimmer Michael Phelps, who said he had been struck by how much Spieth expected of himself. McCormick and Spieth’s caddie, Michael Greller, consider Spieth’s perfectionism a   sword: It motivates him to keep working diligently, but he can be steered off track by the internal torrent of negativity when he falls short. “I’m very reliant on Michael for positive energy, positive voice,” Spieth said of Greller. Then there are the external pressures. A story in a local newspaper two days before the start of the Genesis Open mentioned that Spieth, a   winner in   had “only” two victories last season, as if he had fallen on hard times. If that is struggling, most of Jordan’s contemporaries have never experienced such success: Of the 144 players in the Genesis Open field, 88 had fewer than two career victories on the PGA Tour. “If that’s those individuals’ perception, they’ve got an extremely high perception of what I’m capable of, so I guess, thank you,” Spieth said, adding, “If that’s a low point for a year, then we’re going to surpass Phil Mickelson. ” Mickelson, 46, has 42 PGA Tour victories but is winless since the 2013 British Open. That, combined with Tiger Woods’s being sidelined with a bad back and stuck indefinitely (perhaps enduringly) on 79 tour victories, has tagged Spieth, 23, America’s “it” player in a   game with no discernible safe zone. Before the tournament in Pebble Beach, Spieth tried to accommodate young fans seeking his signature while ignoring the professional autograph hunters, a few of whom became profane when they realized he was not going to engage with them. Spieth later expressed frustration over the adults who obtain his autograph to sell online, saying, “Get a job instead of trying to make money off of the stuff that we have been able to do. ” Appropriately, then, Spieth’s inner circle is a few   short of an entourage. Greller, his caddie, eschewed the chic boutique properties that ring the nearby beaches and spent the first two nights here with his wife at a budget hotel. Spieth’s parents missed his victory in Pebble Beach because they were watching their younger son, Steven, a senior starter on the Brown basketball team, play in home games against Harvard and Dartmouth. Spieth’s girlfriend, Annie Verret, was in Pebble Beach but did not accompany him to Malibu. Spieth has his friends on the tour, like Justin Thomas and Kelly Kraft, the   in Pebble Beach, whom Spieth has included in his favorites on his PGA Tour app, which allows fans to track their favorite players’ statistics and results. One player not on Spieth’s favorite list: himself. That would be too meta, the equivalent of talking about oneself in the third person. “I normally check my app when I’m not playing that week, so there’s no use in having myself on there,” Spieth said. Grinning, he added, “Plus, I kind of know where I am at all times. ” Spieth is also close to his Under Armour family, whose members are always no more than a text away. After his victory in Pebble Beach, Spieth received messages from the Patriots quarterback and Super Bowl most valuable player Tom Brady and the   reigning N. B. A. player of the year, Stephen Curry. Both of those stars have found themselves, intentionally or not, thrust into the political conversation. Brady has been questioned over his friendship with President Trump, and Curry has taken issue with the relationship of Under Armour’s founder, Kevin Plank, with the president. The understated Spieth was apologetically quiet when asked about Plank during a   round on Wednesday. “I have been advised to not say anything politically by my team,” he said. He added, “I’m sorry. ” At the shoe event, Spieth sat in a director’s chair with his back to the sun as it set over the Pacific. It was a scene straight out of Hollywood, complete with a celebrity interviewer. The model and actress Kelly Rohrbach informed those in attendance of her own accomplishments  —   filming a new “Baywatch” movie and swimsuit modeling for Sports Illustrated  —   before turning her attention to Spieth, who corrected her when she described his win at Pebble Beach as his 10th tour victory. At the end of the event, as they were saying their goodbyes, Rohrbach blurted out, “You’re lovely. ” When Spieth was out of earshot, she said: “I was struck by how well spoken he is and how incredibly humble he is. He’s focused, but in the warmest way. There’s a confidence in him that seems to come from work ethic and not bravado. ” During their interview, Spieth told Rohrbach that he felt “so strongly” about his role in the design of the shoes, which was all geared toward performance. It is about science, he added, not style or even sales. “It’s like when I’m playing golf,” Spieth said. “It’s about how am I going to shoot the best score, even if it’s not the prettiest. ”	1

605	 National Security Agency whistleblower Edward Snowden, has made a new controversial claim yesterday, saying that he possessed some classified information proving that Osama Bin Laden is still alive … According to [Snowden], not only is Bin Laden still alive, but he is living a lavish lifestyle in the Bahamas, thanks to regular payments from the CIA.“I have documents showing that Bin Laden is still on the CIA’s payroll,” claims Edward Snowden. “He is still receiving more than $100,000 a month, which are being transferred through some front businesses and organizations, directly to his Nassau bank account. I am not certain where he is now, but in 2013, he was living quietly in his villa with five of his wives and many children.”Mr. Snowden says the CIA orchestrated the fake death of the former leader of Al Qaeda, while he was actually transported with his family in an undisclosed location in the Bahamas.“Osama Bin Laden was one of the CIA’s most efficient operatives for a long time,” claims the famous whistleblower. “What kind of message would it send their other operatives if they were to let the SEALs kill him? They organized his fake death with the collaboration of the Pakistani Secret services, and he simply abandoned his cover. Since everyone believes he is dead, nobody’s looking for him, so it was pretty easy to disappear.

837	 Post on face book from Now 8 News claiming that 7 tons of bananas were infested with Shistosmiasis worms and are being recalled. The parasite is waterborne in various countries including Maylasia, where Walmart gets most its bananas. Alert says not to bring back to the store, but to wrap in plastic bag and throw away. Alert says do not put down the disposal or water supply could be contaminated. Shows video of disgusting worm on banana. Claims several people in the hospital from ingesting the infested fruit. That there is a mass panic. Parasite ingestion could cause symptoms of dizziness, headache, nausea, fatigue, and in some severe cases stroke-like conditions. Although they are recalling bananas purchased between the dates of July 30 — August 6, they are asking consumers NOT to return the bananas to the stores. They are asking, if at all possible, to burn the bananas. If you do not have access to this type of disposal, the World Health Organization is asking you to seal them tightly in a trash bag but DO NOT dispose of them down the kitchen sink. This could contaminate the water supply, as these parasites thrive off of water.Currently, 187 people have been hospitalized and 23 are in critical condition. Symptoms include dizziness, headaches, nausea, fatigue and stomach bloating. In severe cases, the parasites can affect the nervous system causing stroke-like conditions. If you feel that you have been exposed to the Schistosomiasis parasites you should take yourself to the hospital immediately.	0
454	Donald J. Trump was introduced to millions of Americans in prime time through reality TV. In his first address to a joint session of Congress, President Trump tried to show, after a tumultuous first month, that he could also do scripted. The content of the president’s speech  —   on trade, terrorism and other issues  —   was much like what we’d heard from him in the campaign. But Mr. Trump’s goal seemed to be about his tone more than his text: to reassure America that he could simply keep control for an hour. Since his inauguration, Mr. Trump has, for starters, picked a fight on Twitter over Arnold Schwarzenegger’s “Celebrity Apprentice” ratings, declared that negative polls and news are fake, raged against his own intelligence agencies over leaks and spun a tale that millions of illegal voters cost him the popular vote. On Tuesday night, even his neckwear was more muted: a striped    tie, not a blazing red one, as if to signal that he was putting away his bullfighter’s cloth for one night. During the campaign, Mr. Trump was known for going on furious improv tears, throwing belligerent verbiage against the turbine fan of his aggression. On Tuesday night, he had a script. He largely stuck to it. He performed a   version of his campaign persona  —   the    circles, little riffs. (“Great wall” in his prepared remarks became “great, great wall” he added a joke about   executives trying to get him to ride one of their motorcycles.) The character he was playing this night was not the angry boss who might fire someone, but the executive who needed to reassure his shareholders. Although Mr. Trump won office by running an unconventional campaign, his address used many of the conventional tools of past presidents. He created moments by inviting guests  —   a tradition that goes back to Ronald Reagan  —   including the widow of  Chief Petty Officer William  Owens of the Navy SEALs, who drew a very long, emotional round of applause. (Afterward, Mr. Trump said that the fallen soldier was “looking down” and “very happy because I think he just broke a record. ”) The father of Chief Owens earlier refused to meet with Mr. Trump, insisting on an investigation into the death. But Mr. Trump also used those he invited to send a darker message. In a passage on immigration, he pointed out four relatives of people murdered by undocumented immigrants he had invited the victims’ families to sit in the box with his wife, Melania. This was showmanship, too, but of a much darker kind, meant to whip up fear against undocumented immigrants by implying that they’re more dangerous than   Americans. Study after study shows that immigrants commit crimes at a lower rate than   Americans. But if you skew the publicity, you skew the impressions. Put “immigrants” and “kill” in the same sentence often enough and people hear, “Immigrants kill. ” That   familiar from his campaign, was a reminder that he still had an obligation to throw red meat to the passionate voters who got him elected. He deployed the phrase “radical Islamic terrorism,” which his new national security adviser, Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster, had reportedly asked him not to use, but which he had made a verbal totem in the campaign. Above all, Mr. Trump used the theater and scale naturally built into the event to show his status. The Democrats, in their televised response by  former Gov.  Steven Beshear of Kentucky, a champion of Obamacare, tried to make a virtue of the difference in grandeur by having it take place in a diner. Mr. Trump had used his speech for some damage control, beginning it by denouncing hate crimes he had been criticized for avoiding: the murder of an Indian technology worker in Kansas, blamed on a man who is said to have thought his victim was Middle Eastern, and the rash of bomb threats against Jewish community centers and desecration of Jewish cemeteries. “We are a country,” Mr. Trump said, “that stands united in condemning hate and evil in all its forms. ” But not that united. The health care issue was one of many that demonstrated the divide in the room: When Mr. Trump promised to repeal Obamacare, Republicans stood and cheered, Democrats booed and gave thumbs down on camera. For at least a year,   pundits have been like forlorn   scanning the sky for the appearance of the Great American Pivot. Judging by the pundit round tables after his speech, Mr. Trump gave them, for a while, reason to think it had returned. That has happened before. “At the right time,” he told NBC’s “Today” during the campaign, “I will be so presidential, you will be so bored. ” Since then, America has been a lot of things, but not bored. On Tuesday night, however, Mr. Trump declared, “The time for trivial fights is behind us. ” True enough: Mr. Schwarzenegger’s “Celebrity Apprentice” broadcast its finale two weeks ago. But history suggests we wait to declare the pivot achieved, at least until the congressional crowd has cleared and Mr. Trump has gotten his phone back for a while.	1

82	WASHINGTON  —   President Trump and his top aides coordinated their response to North Korea’s missile test on Saturday night in full view of diners at Mr. Trump’s    resort in Florida  —   a remarkable public display of presidential activity that is almost always conducted in highly secure settings. The scene  —   of aides huddled over their computers and the president on his cellphone at his club’s terrace  —   was captured by a club member dining not far away and published in pictures on his Facebook account. The images also show Mr. Trump conferring with his guest at the resort, Shinzo Abe, the Japanese prime minister. Shortly before the club member, Richard DeAgazio, who joined Mr. Trump’s club recently, took the pictures, North Korea   a ballistic missile into the sea off its eastern coast. Mr. DeAgazio posted his photographs to Facebook as the two leaders and their staff members reviewed documents and worked on their laptops, using cellphones as flashlights. “HOLY MOLY ! !! It was fascinating to watch the flurry of activity at dinner when the news came that North Korea had launched a missile in the direction of Japan,” Mr. DeAgazio wrote later on Facebook, describing how the two leaders “conferred and then went into another room for hastily arranged press conference. ” “Wow. .... the center of the action! !!” Mr. DeAgazio wrote in the post. The scene at    was first reported by CNN. Mr. DeAgazio did not respond to a call seeking comment. The fact that the national security incident played out in public view drew swift condemnation from Democrats, who said it was irresponsible for Mr. Trump not to have moved his discussion to a more private location. “There’s no excuse for letting an international crisis play out in front of a bunch of country club members like dinner theater,” Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the Democratic leader in the House, wrote on Twitter. Senators Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island and Tom Udall of New Mexico, Democrats who have called for Mr. Trump’s club to release a list of its members, denounced the president on Monday for discussing the North Korean missile launch in the open. “This is America’s foreign policy, not this week’s episode of ‘Saturday Night Live,’” the senators said in a statement. “We urge our Republican colleagues to start taking this administration’s rash and unprofessional conduct seriously before there are consequences we all regret. ” Republican senators also seemed puzzled by the president’s actions. Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, said, “Usually that’s not a place where you do that kind of thing. ” Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, could barely find words. “Can’t make it up,” he said. Michael J. Morell, a former acting C. I. A. director under President Barack Obama, said, “Every president with whom I have worked would have gone to a private room to have what was potentially a classified discussion. ” Mr. Trump was at his    resort in Palm Beach, Fla.  —   known casually as the Winter White House  —   for a     weekend with Mr. Abe, including time with the prime minister on the golf course and dinners with their spouses. Around 8 p. m. on Saturday, the two leaders appeared for a brief   together at the main entrance to the resort. Mr. Trump ignored a shouted question from a reporter about the North Korean missile test, which had occurred about an hour earlier. The president and his guests dined at the resort’s restaurant during the next two hours, eventually providing the flurry of national security activity that Mr. DeAgazio captured. Around 10:30 p. m. Mr. Trump and Mr. Abe made short statements to a small group of reporters brought to a separate room in the resort. Sean Spicer, the president’s press secretary, told reporters at the White House that Mr. Trump and Mr. Abe had not reviewed classified material on the resort’s patio. Mr. Spicer said the president was briefed about North Korea in a secure location on the property. It is against the law for officials to be handling classified materials in a nonsecure setting. Mr. Spicer said Mr. Trump and his aides were reviewing “news conference logistics” about the North Korean missile test. But national security veterans of past administrations still expressed surprise that Mr. Trump and his staff would not have excused themselves to be able to have candid conversations about the North Korean situation and to review sensitive or classified documents. Discussions about how to respond to international incidents involving adversaries like North Korea are almost always conducted in places that have   protections against eavesdropping, like the White House Situation Room. When presidents are away from the White House, they often conduct important business in a Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility, or SCIF, a location that can be made temporarily impervious to eavesdropping. Such facilities can be installed permanently in places that the president visits frequently, like   . And a communications team travels with the president wherever he goes to ensure that he can communicate securely regardless of where he is. There are examples from the previous administration. In 2011, the White House released a photograph of Mr. Obama and members of his national security team sitting in a secure tent while on a trip to Brazil. Mr. Obama had begun attacks on Libya and was conferring about the military operation. Two years later, Mr. Obama held a dinner with President Xi Jinping of China at the Sunnylands resort in Rancho Mirage, Calif. But the dinner between the leaders was out of sight of members of the public, in a private dining room. Mr. Trump and White House aides who joined him and Mr. Abe for dinner on Saturday, including Stephen K. Bannon, the president’s chief strategist, did not relocate the discussion to a secure location. Mr. Trump appears to enjoy presenting the spectacle of his presidency to those at his privately held club, where members pay $200, 000 to join. While the club is not open to the public, Mr. Trump’s dinner with Mr. Abe was in the club’s dining room, where members and their guests were likely to be. Individual club members can invite guests, submitting a list of names of table guests to security officials ahead of time. But none of that would give them clearance to see sensitive or classified material handled by the president or his aides. In addition to posting the pictures of the North Korea conversation, Mr. DeAgazio also published pictures of himself standing with a person he described as Mr. Trump’s military aide responsible for carrying the nuclear “football”  —   the briefcase that contains codes for launching nuclear weapons. After news reports were published about Mr. DeAgazio’s Facebook account, the account was deleted, along with the photographs. Representatives of the    resort did not respond to requests for comment about Mr. DeAgazio’s use of social media to post photographs of the president.	1
138	WASHINGTON  —   Phone records and intercepted calls show that members of Donald J. Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign and other Trump associates had repeated contacts with senior Russian intelligence officials in the year before the election, according to four current and former American officials. American law enforcement and intelligence agencies intercepted the communications around the same time they were discovering evidence that Russia was trying to disrupt the presidential election by hacking into the Democratic National Committee, three of the officials said. The intelligence agencies then sought to learn whether the Trump campaign was colluding with the Russians on the hacking or other efforts to influence the election. The officials interviewed in recent weeks said that, so far, they had seen no evidence of such cooperation. But the intercepts alarmed American intelligence and law enforcement agencies, in part because of the amount of contact that was occurring while Mr. Trump was speaking glowingly about the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin. At one point last summer, Mr. Trump said at a campaign event that he hoped Russian intelligence services had stolen Hillary Clinton’s emails and would make them public. The officials said the intercepted communications were not limited to Trump campaign officials, and included other associates of Mr. Trump. On the Russian side, the contacts also included members of the government outside of the intelligence services, they said. All of the current and former officials spoke on the condition of anonymity because the continuing investigation is classified. The officials said that one of the advisers picked up on the calls was Paul Manafort, who was Mr. Trump’s campaign chairman for several months last year and had worked as a political consultant in Ukraine. The officials declined to identify the other Trump associates on the calls. The call logs and intercepted communications are part of a larger trove of information that the F. B. I. is sifting through as it investigates the links between Mr. Trump’s associates and the Russian government, as well as the hacking of the D. N. C. according to federal law enforcement officials. As part of its inquiry, the F. B. I. has obtained banking and travel records and conducted interviews, the officials said. Mr. Manafort, who has not been charged with any crimes, dismissed the officials’ accounts in a telephone interview on Tuesday. “This is absurd,” he said. “I have no idea what this is referring to. I have never knowingly spoken to Russian intelligence officers, and I have never been involved with anything to do with the Russian government or the Putin administration or any other issues under investigation today. ” He added, “It’s not like these people wear badges that say, ‘I’m a Russian intelligence officer. ’” Several of Mr. Trump’s associates, like Mr. Manafort, have done business in Russia. And it is not unusual for American businessmen to come in contact with foreign intelligence officials, sometimes unwittingly, in countries like Russia and Ukraine, where the spy services are deeply embedded in society. Law enforcement officials did not say to what extent the contacts might have been about business. The officials would not disclose many details, including what was discussed on the calls, the identity of the Russian intelligence officials who participated, and how many of Mr. Trump’s advisers were talking to the Russians. It is also unclear whether the conversations had anything to do with Mr. Trump himself. A report from American intelligence agencies that was made public in January concluded that the Russian government had intervened in the election in part to help Mr. Trump, but did not address whether any members of the Trump campaign had participated in the effort. The intercepted calls are different from the wiretapped conversations last year between Michael T. Flynn, Mr. Trump’s former national security adviser, and Sergey I. Kislyak, Russia’s ambassador to the United States. In those calls, which led to Mr. Flynn’s resignation on Monday night, the two men discussed sanctions that the Obama administration imposed on Russia in December. But the cases are part of American intelligence and law enforcement agencies’ routine electronic surveillance of the communications of foreign officials. The F. B. I. declined to comment. The White House also declined to comment Tuesday night, but earlier in the day, the press secretary, Sean Spicer, stood by Mr. Trump’s previous comments that nobody from his campaign had contact with Russian officials before the election. “There’s nothing that would conclude me that anything different has changed with respect to that time period,” Mr. Spicer said in response to a question. Two days after the election in November, Sergei A. Ryabkov, the deputy Russian foreign minister, said “there were contacts” during the campaign between Russian officials and Mr. Trump’s team. “Obviously, we know most of the people from his entourage,” Mr. Ryabkov told Russia’s Interfax news agency. The Trump transition team denied Mr. Ryabkov’s statement. “This is not accurate,” Hope Hicks, a spokeswoman for Mr. Trump, said at the time. The National Security Agency, which monitors the communications of foreign intelligence services, initially captured the calls between Mr. Trump’s associates and the Russians as part of routine foreign surveillance. After that, the F. B. I. asked the N. S. A. to collect as much information as possible about the Russian operatives on the phone calls, and to search through troves of previous intercepted communications that had not been analyzed. The F. B. I. has closely examined at least three other people close to Mr. Trump, although it is unclear if their calls were intercepted. They are Carter Page, a businessman and former foreign policy adviser to the campaign Roger Stone, a longtime Republican operative and Mr. Flynn. All of the men have strongly denied that they had any improper contacts with Russian officials. As part of the inquiry, the F. B. I. is also trying to assess the credibility of the information contained in a dossier that was given to the bureau last year by a former British intelligence operative. The dossier contained a raft of allegations of a broad conspiracy between Mr. Trump, his associates and the Russian government. It also included unsubstantiated claims that the Russians had embarrassing videos that could be used to blackmail Mr. Trump. The F. B. I. has spent several months investigating the leads in the dossier, but has yet to confirm any of its most explosive claims. Senior F. B. I. officials believe that the former British intelligence officer who compiled the dossier, Christopher Steele, has a credible track record, and he briefed investigators last year about how he obtained the information. One American law enforcement official said that F. B. I. agents had made contact with some of Mr. Steele’s sources. The agency’s investigation of Mr. Manafort began last spring as an outgrowth of a criminal investigation into his work for a   political party in Ukraine and for the country’s former president, Viktor F. Yanukovych. It has focused on why he was in such close contact with Russian and Ukrainian intelligence officials. The bureau did not have enough evidence to obtain a warrant for a wiretap of Mr. Manafort’s communications, but it had the N. S. A. scrutinize the communications of Ukrainian officials he had met. The F. B. I. investigation is proceeding at the same time that separate investigations into Russian interference in the election are gaining momentum on Capitol Hill. Those investigations, by the House and Senate Intelligence Committees, are examining not only the Russian hacking but also any contacts that Mr. Trump’s team had with Russian officials during the campaign. On Tuesday, top Republican lawmakers said that Mr. Flynn should be one focus of the investigation, and that he should be called to testify before Congress. Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the Intelligence Committee, said the news about Mr. Flynn underscored “how many questions still remain unanswered to the American people more than three months after Election Day, including who was aware of what, and when. ” Mr. Warner said Mr. Flynn’s resignation would not stop the committee “from continuing to investigate General Flynn, or any other campaign official who may have had inappropriate and improper contacts with Russian officials prior to the election. ”	1
632	 People voting for Bernie Sanders in today’s New York primary are seeing their ballots changed to show a vote for Hillary Clinton.Calls began flooding in early this morning to New York-based ABC affiliate WGRZ with reports of voting machines across the state switching votes entered for Democrat Bernie Sanders to his establishment counterpart Hillary Clinton. The station has spoken with multiple witnesses and is in the process of verifying statements from voters Upstate (districts 20, 21, 22 and 24) as well as two of the five boroughs (Bronx and Manhattan).According to one witness identified as Jason Jones from Manhattan, “It was the strangest thing. The machine literally would not allow me to vote Bernie. I have been a Bernie supporter since he launched his campaign and have absolutely no reason to vote for Shillary. I have heard the same from several others coming out of the voting booth. Seems like the establishment will stop at nothing to keep this out of the hands of Bernie.”Brian Johnston, a volunteer and self-professed Hillary supporter who is overseeing the voting at the 9th district, had this to say, “These allegations have no basis in reality. If Sanders supporters cannot figure out how to use a voting machine maybe they shouldn’t be voting.” This site is in no way affiliated with The Huffington Post.

68	UNITED NATIONS  —   The shock is gone. Panic is subsiding. Now, diplomats who represent the nations of the world are entering what one described as the third stage of grief: figuring out how to deal with President Trump. They’re scrambling to speak with his advisers and poring over his Twitter posts  —   or if they’re old school, ordering their minions to print out   lists of presidential outbursts. They’re watching anxiously how he reacts to a series of   tests (military provocations by   separatists in Ukraine, for instance) while trying to parse the contradictory statements coming out of his administration (what exactly is the United States’ view on Russia? ). And they’re counting on his United Nations envoy, Nikki R. Haley, to be a coolheaded adviser, even as they wonder whether she, his     critic, has her mercurial boss’s ear. Their doubts surfaced late Friday over the abruptly annulled appointment of a Palestinian leader for a senior United Nations post. Diplomats said they had been led to believe the appointment of the Palestinian, Salam Fayyad, had been approved by all Security Council members  —   only to be greeted with a   statement from Ms. Haley’s office, quashing the appointment. The United States does not recognize Palestine as a state, the statement read, raising questions about whether Ms. Haley had been overridden by the White House. So far, she has revealed little of her world views, except an opening salvo that did not go down very well among her peers. “For those who don’t have our back, we’re taking names,” she said of America’s allies in her first remarks at the United Nations headquarters, and then repurposed it into a hashtag: #TakingNames. So far on Mr. Trump’s watch, Iran and North Korea have carried out ballistic missile tests, Israel has expanded settlements and fighting has escalated between Ukraine and   rebels  —   all regarded as early tests for the White House. His travel ban on seven   nations has given ballast to the Islamic State, his somersaults on Taiwan are seen to have strengthened China’s hand, and his unpleasant exchanges with the leaders of close allies like Mexico and Australia have left many diplomats wondering whether they can count on the world’s most powerful nation as a reliable partner. Mr. Trump’s supporters see his edicts and outbursts as perfectly consistent with his campaign promise to upend the establishment, reassert America’s primacy and put all on notice not to trifle with him  —   a kind of chaos theory of   management to leave everyone guessing, all the time. For America’s friends in the world, the uncertainty is complicated by not knowing exactly whom to talk to. The warrens of the State Department are unusually empty. Obama administration officials have packed up new appointments have yet to be made. And a series of contradictory statements have emerged from cabinet officials about crucial issues  —   not least Russia. Mr. Trump has continued to express his admiration for his counterpart in the Kremlin, Vladimir V. Putin. Yet Ms. Haley has taken a different posture. In both her confirmation hearing and in her first open remarks in the Security Council, she condemned Russia’s “aggressive actions” in Ukraine and insisted that United States sanctions on Moscow would remain. Several Western envoys breathed a sigh of relief, but not without doubts. Was she speaking for herself, or for the administration? Was the inconsistency deliberate, or did it reflect a lack of consensus? Who is setting United States policy, and whom should they be talking to? “Unanswerable right now,” advised Kathleen Hicks, a Pentagon official under President Barack Obama and now a senior vice president at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. “They’re smartest to have multiple points of entry. Backups to backups. ” Ms. Haley will have to weigh in on difficult, contentious issues that are already on the United Nations’ agenda: how to save South Sudan from what could be a genocide, say, or whether to punish the president of Syria, Bashar   for unleashing chemical weapons on his people, or how to stanch the spread of terrorism in West Africa. Yet she has not expressed opinions on much. On Twitter, she posted selfies with her husband, Michael, and a YouTube video of Billy Joel singing “New York State of Mind. ” She admitted to being excited to see the movie “Deepwater Horizon,” and offered a new hashtag: #WeekendsInNYC. On the last Sunday of January, as Mr. Trump’s travel ban left immigrants and refugees stranded across the world, Ms. Haley wrote a Twitter post about her husband driving up to New York with the family’s pets, including two frogs and a fish. On Saturday night, after North Korea tested a missile, Ms. Haley posted a Twitter message about her admiration for Joan Jett, the 1980s rock star. What kind of influence she may have on the White House remains unknown. She is far from being a confidante of Mr. Trump’s, and it’s unclear how much sway she will have over him on any of the big crises facing the world. “Nikki Haley will be a perfectly normal politician sent to be ambassador,” said Eliot A. Cohen, a former Bush administration official. Mr. Trump, he warned, has “instincts and prejudices which are out of the norm of American diplomatic belief and practice. ” The diplomatic corps is queuing up to see her  —   and those who score face time are wasting no time sharing it. “The #SpecialRelationship comes to @UN,”  the British ambassador, Matthew Rycroft, posted on Twitter, along with a photo of the two of them shoulder to shoulder. “Very positive meeting,” offered the Ukrainian ambassador, Volodymyr Y. Yelchenko, posting a picture of his own. At a crowded reception one recent evening, one diplomat described the first weeks of the Trump presidency as “surreal,” as though he were describing a Luis Buñuel movie. Then he spotted Ms. Haley and deftly snaked through the crowd to introduce himself. I spoke to more than a dozen diplomats for this article, and nearly all described Ms. Haley, the former governor of South Carolina, as a natural politician and a refreshing contrast to the president. “Cordial,” one envoy said. “Businesslike,” said another. “We need to find a way to engage with the new administration, particularly with Ambassador Haley, and to explore with them what we can do together,” said João Vale de Almeida, the envoy representing the European Union’s 28 member nations. “In doing so, we should try to avoid dangers and pitfalls. ” Vitaly I. Churkin, the Russian ambassador and perhaps Ms. Haley’s most important colleague on the Council, complimented her “very powerful record” as governor. On Twitter, he said cryptically that he looked forward to working with her according to the “  of their capitals. ” (Her boss, in Washington, has lavished praise on his, in Moscow.) Few people at the United Nations need to be on her good list more than the man who heads the world body, António Guterres. Mr. Trump has dismissed Mr. Guterres’s entire operation as a social club. Republicans in Congress have threatened to pull funding. And Ms. Haley has made it clear that she intends to scrutinize how the United Nations spends its money and eliminate things that do not serve United States interests, while also taking pains to say she would not take a “slash and burn” approach. The United States pays for more than a fifth of the United Nations’ core budget, and controls key jobs in the world body’s system. So Mr. Guterres must strike a balance between keeping United States officials on board and not being seen as subservient to United States interests. He faced that challenge over Mr. Trump’s travel ban. Mr. Guterres was criticized as not speaking out against it directly enough, quickly enough. Finally, he told reporters that the restrictions “violate our basic principles” and called for them to be discontinued. Mr. Guterres is a former socialist prime minister of Portugal. Ms. Haley is a conservative from the American South. But both are politicians, as Richard Gowan, a research fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations, pointed out. And, he argued, they could help each other  —   Ms. Haley in prodding him to show that America gets value at the United Nations, Mr. Guterres by using pressure from her to make the reforms he thinks are necessary. As Mr. Gowan put it in a recent essay, “Their political fortunes are inseparable. ”	1
267	Readers who picked up The New York Times on March 13, 1852, might have seen a small advertisement on Page 3 for a serial tale set to begin the next day in a rival newspaper. “A RICH REVELATION,” the ad began, teasing a rollicking story touching on “the Manners and Morals of Boarding Houses, some Scenes from Church History, Operations in  . ,” and “graphic Sketches of Men and Women” (presented, fear not, with “explanations necessary to properly understand what it is all about”). It was a less than tantalizing brew, perhaps. The story, which was never reviewed or reprinted, appears to have sunk like a stone. But now comes another rich revelation: The anonymously published tale was nothing less than a complete novel by Walt Whitman. The   “Life and Adventures of Jack Engle,” which was discovered last summer by a graduate student, is being republished online on Monday by The Walt Whitman Quarterly Review and in book form by the University of Iowa Press. A   tale of an orphan’s adventures, it features a villainous lawyer, virtuous Quakers,   politicians, a sultry Spanish dancer and more than a few unlikely plot twists and jarring narrative shifts. “This is Whitman’s take on the city mystery novel, a popular genre of the day that pitted the ‘upper 10 thousand’  —   what we would call the 1 percent  —   against the lower million,” said David S. Reynolds, a Whitman expert at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York. But it also, Mr. Reynolds and other scholars who have seen it say, offers clues to another mystery: how a workaday journalist and mostly conventional poet transformed himself into the author of the sensuous, philosophical, wildly experimental and altogether unclassifiable free verse of “Leaves of Grass. ” “It’s like seeing the workshop of a great writer,” said Ed Folsom, the editor of The Walt Whitman Quarterly Review. “We’re discovering the process of Whitman’s own discovery. ” That transformation was one that Whitman himself wished to obscure. He said little about the early 1850s, when he hung a shingle as a carpenter in Brooklyn and published almost nothing, working instead on what became the 1855 first edition of “Leaves of Grass. ” Later, he all but disowned his successful 1842 temperance novel “Franklin Evans or The Inebriate,” and had little interest in seeing his short fiction revived. “My serious wish,” he wrote in 1882, “were to have all those crude and boyish pieces quietly dropp’d in oblivion. ” In 1891, when a critic was planning on republishing some of his early tales, he was blunt: “I should almost be tempted to shoot him if I had an opportunity. ” That doesn’t faze Zachary Turpin, the graduate student at the University of Houston who found the “Jack Engle. ” In fact, this is the second time archival lightning has struck Mr. Turpin. Last year, he announced the discovery of “Manly Health and Training,” a previously unknown     treatise that Whitman published in The New York Atlas in 1858. “A friend joked that that’s what would be on my gravestone,” Mr. Turpin said. The library of lost American literature includes many “known unknowns,” as Mr. Turpin put it (channeling Donald H. Rumsfeld) like Herman Melville’s “The Isle of the Cross” (the eighth and final novel he may, or may not, have finished) and Whitman’s “The Sleeptalker,” a seemingly completed 1850 novel he discusses in his letters, but which does not survive. Mr. Turpin has made a specialty of looking for the “unknown unknowns,” using vast online databases that compile millions of pages of   newspapers. One day last May, he entered some names and phrases from fragmentary notes for a possible story concerning an embezzling lawyer named Covert and an orphan named Jack Engle  —   one of many entries in Whitman’s voluminous notebooks that the online Walt Whitman Archive had deemed to have no clear connection to any known published material. Up popped the advertisement that included the name Jack Engle. The serial was to run in The Sunday Dispatch, a New York paper Whitman was known to have contributed to. “My   was really tingling,” Mr. Turpin said. Mr. Turpin ordered a scan of the first page from the Library of Congress, which held the only known (and as yet undigitized or microfilmed) copy of that day’s Dispatch. A month later, he was stunned to open a file showing a yellowing page containing “Jack Engle” and other names from Whitman’s notes. “I was at my  ’ setting up a Pack ’n Play, when the email arrived,” he recalled. “From that day until now, I’ve had this simmering inside me. ” The   tale, published in six   installments, may not belong in the American literary canon. “It’s not a great novel, though it’s not a bad read either,” said Mr. Reynolds, the author of “Walt Whitman’s America. ” Mr. Turpin called it “rollicking, interesting, beautiful, beautiful and bizarre,” with antic twists, goofy names and suddenly revealed conspiracies that recall “a   Thomas Pynchon” or even, he ventured, “It’s a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World. ” This may sound a long way from “Leaves of Grass. ” But Jack Engle and the other raffish young male characters, Mr. Reynolds said, are reminiscent of the     persona  —   “Walt Whitman, an American, one of the roughs”  —   he created with “Leaves of Grass. ” And then there’s Chapter 19, which Mr. Folsom called “a magical moment. ” Here, Jack enters the cemetery at Trinity Church in Lower Manhattan, and the madcap plot grinds to a halt in favor of reveries about nature, immortality and the oneness of being that strikingly echo the imagery of Whitman’s great work. “Long, rank grass covered my face,” says Jack, the   narrator. “Over me was the verdure, touched with brown, of trees nourished from the decay of the bodies of men. ” Jack wanders among those bodies of men, copying out the inscriptions of the tombstones of Alexander Hamilton, the War of 1812 hero Capt. James Lawrence (of “Don’t give up the ship!” fame) and other lost lives. Then, he exits onto the streets, where “onward rolled the broad, bright current”  —   and quickly and rather indifferently wraps up his own story. “Throughout the novel, you constantly see Whitman wandering off the plot, looking for life in all the nooks and crannies of the city,” Mr. Folsom said. “With the visit to the cemetery, where all plots end, it’s as if he’s suddenly lost interest in all plots  —   or at least this plot. ” Today, we think of the radically expansive free verse of “Leaves of Grass,” with its wandering “I” who “contains multitudes,” as one of the fixed signposts in American literary history. But in his notebooks from the early 1850s, Mr. Turpin noted, Whitman was toying with other forms for his great work. “You see him asking, Should it be a novel? Or a play, with thousands of people onstage, chanting in unison?” he said. “It’s amazing to think that ‘Leaves of Grass’ could have taken a different form entirely. ” Mr. Turpin said the graveyard chapter put him in mind of “Crossing Brooklyn Ferry,” one of the most famous poems in “Leaves of Grass,” where Whitman declares, “I am with you, you men and women of a generation, or ever so many generations hence. ” But when asked how it felt to be the first in many generations to read Whitman’s   novel, Mr. Turpin reached for another   line. “Whitman said something really great: ‘Nothing is ever really lost, or can be lost,’” he said. “You really do start to believe it after a while. ”	1
582	 Thursday evening, the mysterious hacker collective known as Anonymous hacked the main database for the Internal Revenue Service. The group appeared to have a singular target — Republican Presidential contender Donald Trump. Though Trump has been criticized by both parties for his failure to produce his tax returns, he has consistently refused to do so saying, “You don’t learn anything from a tax return.” After hacking Mitt Romney’s tax returns in 2012, Anonymous clearly believes that knowledge and transparency are important to the public.

884	 Did Marcus Bachmann, husband of Christian conservative former Congresswoman Michele Bachmann, file for a divorce from her?   Fresh on the heels of today’s decision by the Supreme Court that the right to same-sex marriage is guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution, comes news from Minnesota that Marcus Bachmann, husband of former Congresswoman Michele Bachmann, has filed for divorce.Rumors of marital discord surfaced last March, after Indiana Governor Mike Pence enacted what became known as the RFRA, or the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. Reports surfaced that Mr. Bachmann was denied service in Indiana from a dress boutique owner who assumed he “was perhaps a homosexual man”, rumors that have been staunchly denied.“It’s unfair that just because Marcus Bachmann shops for Michele’s outfits, he’s branded a gay person,” says GOP fundraiser and political commentator Althea Thoone. “It’s a big gay stereotype. We would all sit and laugh about it. Marcus would laugh the hardest and longest. As Michele has said many times in the past, there’s never been a gay bone in his body.” National Report is a news and political satire web publication, which may or may not use real names, often in semi-real or mostly fictitious ways.

593	 Fox News sources have revealed an Obama administration plot to confiscate all guns owned by citizens on record as belonging to or sympathetic to the Republican party.Under the guise of combating domestic terrorism agents from ATF, DHS, FBI and other government troops have been ordered to kick in doors to confiscate weapons and ammunition from homes where the residents have registered as Republicans or voted for Republican candidates in any election. The operation is said to be scheduled for November 8th of 2016.In an even more sickening invasion of privacy and trampling of rights, the raids are being coordinated to occur when most citizens won’t even be home to protest the illegal seizure of their property. Doors will be kicked in so any weapons or ammunition on the property can be confiscated by the agents and taken out of the residences.Republicans are strongly urged to remain at home on November 8th 2016 to assert their 4th and 2nd amendment rights!	0

42	Hans Rosling, a Swedish doctor who transformed himself into a   statistician by converting dry numbers into dynamic graphics that challenged preconceptions about global health and gloomy prospects for population growth, died on Tuesday in Uppsala, Sweden. He was 68. The cause was pancreatic cancer, according to Gapminder, a foundation he established to generate and disseminate demystified data using images. Even before “ ” entered the lexicon, Dr. Rosling was echoing former Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan’s maxim that everyone is entitled to his own opinions but not to his own facts. “He challenged the whole world’s view of development with his amazing teaching skills,” Isabella Lovin, Sweden’s deputy prime minister, said in a statement. On Twitter, Bill Gates remembered Dr. Rosling as a “great friend, educator and true inspiration. ” A   “edutainer,” Dr. Rosling captivated vast audiences in TED Talks  —   beginning a decade ago in front of live audiences and later viewed online by millions  —   and on television documentaries like the BBC’s “The Joy of Stats” in 2010. Inviting animated visualizations and prosaic props (like apples and colorful Lego plastic blocks) defined him as a funky philosopher rather than a geeky professor. “I produce a road map for the modern world,” he told The Economist in 2010. “Where people want to drive is up to them. But I have the idea that if they have a proper road map and know what the global realities are, they’ll make better decisions. ” In Dr. Rosling’s version of those realities, the traditional divide between   and industrialized nations had become anachronistic, since so many countries were undergoing development, with some in Asia improving faster than some in Europe. He considered that five billion people continued to head toward healthier lives while one billion remained mired in poverty and disease that progress toward health and wealth had contributed to climate change and that the world was so poorly governed that possibilities to improve it abounded. “I’m not an optimist,” Dr. Rosling once said. “I’m a very serious possibilist. ” He predicted that the United Nations’ goal of eradicating extreme poverty by 2030 was attainable because the tools to do so had been identified and the share of people living in that condition had already declined by more than half in 25 years. He also argued vigorously that overpopulation would no longer be problematic as the world grew wealthier and fertility rates declined. “There are so many who think that death keeps control of population growth,” he said in an interview with The Guardian in 2013. “That’s just wrong!” He told The Economist: “The only way to reach sustainable population levels is to improve public health. Child survival is the new green. ” As a medical doctor, epidemiologist and academic, but with the flair of a seasoned performer (he once demonstrated his expertise as a sword swallower) he delivered counterintuitive factoids, accused advocates of tweaking statistics to advance their own causes, and debunked misapprehensions about the third world  —   although not every expert concurred. He pointed out that Sweden had more children per woman than Iran, that Shanghai was just as wealthy and healthy as the Netherlands, and that the world’s average life expectancy of 71 years was now closer to the highest (84 in Japan) than to the lowest (49 in Swaziland). “They just make it about us and them the West and the rest,” Dr. Rosling told the journal Nature in December. “How could anyone hope to solve problems if they didn’t understand the different challenges faced, for example, by Congolese subsistence farmers far from paved roads and Brazilian street vendors in urban favelas?” Hans Gosta Rosling was born in Uppsala on July 27, 1948. His father was a coffee roaster. He studied statistics and medicine at Uppsala University and public health at St. John’s Medical College in Bangalore, India, where he received his medical degree in 1976. In 1979, he and his wife, the former Agneta Thordeman, whom he met while she was studying to be a nurse, moved to Mozambique with their two young children. He was delivering on a pledge he had made years earlier to Eduardo Mondlane, the founder of the Mozambican Liberation Front, to help provide health services when the country became independent. Mr. Mondlane was killed in 1969, six years before independence was granted by Portugal. Dr. Rosling served as district medical officer in a northern province. He was the sole doctor for a population of 300, 000. His investigation of a paralytic disease called konzo in the Democratic Republic of Congo, which was determined to be caused by ingesting naturally occurring cyanide in cassava roots, earned him a doctorate from Uppsala University. In addition to his wife, a pediatrician and researcher, he is survived by two sons, Ola and Magnus a daughter, Anna and a brother, Mats. With his son Ola and his    Anna Rosling Ronnlund, Dr. Rosling established Gapminder in 2006 while he was a professor of global health at the Karolinska Institute, the medical university outside Stockholm. The foundation aims to chart trends and fight what it calls “devastating ignorance with   worldviews everyone can understand. ” It derived its name from the London Underground’s recorded warnings to passengers to “mind the gap” between a subway car and the platform. Gapminder’s data images are designed to evoke the divide between statistics and the misleading ways in which they are sometimes interpreted. “It’s like the emperor’s new clothes, and I’m the little child saying: ‘He’s nude! He’s nude! ’” Dr. Rosling told The Guardian. Brandishing his bubble chart graphics during TED (Technology, Entertainment and Design) Talks, Dr. Rosling often capsulized the macroeconomics of energy and the environment in a favorite anecdote about the day a washing machine was delivered to his family’s   flat. “My mother explained the magic with this machine the very, very first day,” he recalled. “She said: ‘Now Hans, we have loaded the laundry. The machine will make the work. And now we can go to the library.’ Because this is the magic: You load the laundry, and what do you get out of the machine? You get books out of the machines, children’s books. And Mother got time to read to me. ” “Thank you, industrialization,” Dr. Rosling said. “Thank you, steel mill. And thank you, chemical processing industry that gave us time to read books. ”	1
126	SEOUL, South Korea  —   He seemed like an ordinary passenger in the departure hall of the airport for Malaysia’s capital, awaiting a   flight to Macau. Moments later, he felt dizzy and was carried out on a stretcher, apparently dying from   punctures or perhaps a toxic liquid splashed on his face by two women who ran away. The ruckus caused by the man’s death on Monday at the international airport for Kuala Lumpur was minor news until a thunderbolt from the South Korean and Malaysian news media a day later: The victim was Kim   45, the estranged older half brother of Kim   the unpredictable and ruthless leader of North Korea. The death immediately turned into an international assassination intrigue connected to the opaque regime of the Kim family, which has ruled North Korea for more than 60 years. It came as Kim   33, who has ordered scores of subordinates executed when he questioned their fealty, has further shaken up the ranks of his closest aides, purging the chief of the secret police less than two weeks ago. In addition, Kim   has stoked a new international crisis with a ballistic missile launching and threats of more nuclear weapons tests. The South Korean news channel TV Chosun said that two women had stabbed Kim   with poisoned needles and fled in a taxi and that the local police were searching for them. The Star, a Malaysian newspaper, quoted the police as saying the victim had sought help from a departure hall receptionist after someone “grabbed him from behind and splashed liquid on his face. ” He died as medics rushed him to a hospital. Political experts on North Korea’s politics immediately speculated that Kim   had ordered the assassination of his older half sibling, who at one time had been the heir apparent and had been favored by China, the country’s ally and principal benefactor. “Maybe Kim   was about to do something drastic that would either compromise the regime or the family,” said Jae H. Ku, director of the U. S.  Institute at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies. “By the nature of things in North Korea, the fact that he is in the bloodline represented a threat. ” Others were even more emphatic in their suspicion that Kim   had been responsible, partly because Kim   had been publicly critical of the transfer of power that made Kim   the top leader after the death of their father, Kim   in 2011. “The apparent murder today of Kim   in Malaysia by agents of his brother is the latest explosive turn in Pyongyang’s vicious palace intrigue,” said Nicholas Eberstadt, a political economist who specializes in North and South Korea at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington. “The question remains: Do these deadly measures secure his rule or serve to undermine it?” There also was speculation that Kim   might have ordered Kim   killed because China might have been planning to support him as a replacement for Kim   who has angered Chinese leaders with his provocative weapons and missile tests. “Kim   reportedly has been Beijing’s favorite, which may mean one day the Chinese Communist Party may overthrow Kim   and install Kim ” said Lee   a North Korea expert at Tufts University’s Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy. The Royal Malaysia Police identified the dead man as Kim Chol, an alias that South Korean officials said had been used by Kim  . A police statement said the cause of death was under investigation. In Seoul on Wednesday, Prime Minister Hwang   who is serving as acting president during the impeachment trial of President Park   called a meeting of   cabinet ministers and urged his government to work closely with the Malaysian authorities to help uncover who killed Kim  . “If he was killed by the Kim   regime, it will be an example of its cruelty and inhumaneness,” Mr. Hwang said. North Korea’s   media has said nothing about the reports. Kim   the eldest son of Kim   had been widely considered next in line to succeed him until 2001, when he was caught trying to take his son to Tokyo Disneyland with a fake visa. He was detained for several days, then deported to China. Other analysts in South Korea say Kim   fell out of the succession race after his mother, Sung   was rejected by the North Korean leader, who favored Kim  ’s mother, Ko  . Ms. Ko and Kim   had another son, Kim   who was seen at an Eric Clapton concert in London in 2015. North Korea began grooming Kim   as heir after his father  had a stroke in 2008. As his youngest brother consolidated power, Kim   lived in   abroad. Until recently, he was sometimes seen in Macau. TV Chosun said he had also been visiting Singapore and Malaysia, where he had girlfriends. Kim  ’s son, Kim   had once studied in Bosnia and later in France. In an interview with a European television channel in 2012, the son said he did not know how his uncle, Kim   “became a dictator. ” Kim   was once questioned in Macau by a reporter about the likelihood that his half brother would take over, and he seemed to accept his fate. “It is my father’s decision,” he said. “So, once he decides, we have to support. ” But at other times, he was critical of Kim  ’s ascendance. “I believe that my father originally was against the notion of a third generation succeeding him,” Kim   interviewed in November 2010, told the Japanese journalist Yoji Gomi in the book “My Father, Kim   and I. ” “There must have been some internal reasons that made him change his mind. ” Kim   also once predicted doom for his half brother’s rule while talking to reporters from Japan, North Korea’s sworn enemy. His criticism fueled speculation that China and certain generals in Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, might be protecting him in case anything should go wrong with Kim  ’s rule. Mr. Gomi said in an interview on Tuesday that the last time he had contacted Kim   in January 2012, he had said North Korea should follow China’s economic path. China supported Kim   financially for many years because if Kim   died, North Koreans, indoctrinated to venerate the Kim family, would look to Kim   to step in as leader, according to Kang Chunnu, 51, a distant relative of the Kim family who lives in Britain. “Kim   is a person which China can control and the North Korean people can trust,” she said by telephone. There seemed little question in South Korea that Kim   was behind his half brother’s death. A spokesman for South Korea’s governing Liberty Korea Party, Kim   said the killing was a “naked example of Kim  ’s reign of terror. ” Since taking power, Mr. Kim has executed more than 140 senior party and military officials deemed a threat to his authority, often ordering them killed by machine guns and even flamethrowers, according to the Institute for National Security Strategy, a research group affiliated with the South’s National Intelligence Service. Thae   who was the North’s No. 2 diplomat in London until his defection to South Korea last summer, said he had fled partly because of Kim  ’s ruthlessness. In 2015, South Korean officials said that Gen. Hyon   the defense minister, had been executed with an antiaircraft gun in Pyongyang after dozing off during military events and   Mr. Kim’s orders. In August last year, they said Mr. Kim found fault with a deputy premier’s “disrespectful posture” during a meeting and had him executed by firing squad. Relatives were not spared. An uncle and the country’s No. 2 official, Jang   was executed in 2013 on charges of factionalism, corruption and sedition. Defectors from North Korea live in fear of retaliation. In 1997, Lee   a nephew of Kim  ’s mother, was shot and killed in Seoul. South Korean officials suspected that a North Korean agent killed Mr. Lee, who had become a bitter critic of the government in Pyongyang after defecting to Seoul in 1982. Cheong   a longtime researcher on the Kim family, said that the killing of Kim   could have been carried out only on the orders of Kim  . Ken E. Gause, a specialist in leadership studies at the CNA Corporation, a research group in Alexandria, Va. said the assassination also might have been meant as a warning to all North Korean expatriates. “Given the recent defections,” he said, “Kim   felt the need to show that the regime could get to anyone who may be contemplating opposing the regime. ”	1

Among the findings of a 2015 “National Customer Rage Study” by Customer Care Measurement  Consulting: Companies are doing all the right things the wrong way. For example, they have call centers, but they’re understaffed, which causes complaints to pile up. The report, conducted in collaboration with Arizona State University and Dialog Direct, was the seventh since 1976. The latest report found that 54 percent of customers reported a problem with a product or service in the preceding 12 months, an increase of 4 percentage points from 2013. In 1976, that figure was 32 percent. Scott M. Broetzmann, the president and chief executive of Customer Care, said companies direct consumers toward   the   approach. Consumers have been empowered by technology to perform routine tasks, such as checking an account balance or placing an order, but things can go awry when they have a question or problem. Mr. Broetzmann said companies sometimes rely on “disingenuous approaches,” which can be vexing or meaningless to customers, to internally measure their performance. For example, some call centers require a representative to say a customer’s name at least three times during a call. A 2015 report by the International Customer Management Institute, a training and research organization, emphasized that point. “When it comes to selecting metric and data sources, it doesn’t make sense to measure something simply because it’s always been measured or because it’s the latest industry trend,” the report said. “Using old approaches or data sources and expecting new or different outcomes is a quick path to insanity. ” It is because we end up feeling invisible and disrespected, Kit Yarrow, a consumer psychologist and a professor emerita of psychology and marketing at Golden Gate University in San Francisco, said in an email. “Disrespect can inspire rage because in the most primitive parts of our brains it’s tied to our survival,” she wrote. In days when we were cave dwellers, “to be overlooked or irrelevant was to die,” she added. The customer rage study found that nearly 50 percent of respondents found the statement “Your call is important to us, please continue to hold” very annoying, with another 17 percent saying it should be banned.   were: “That’s our policy” “We are currently assisting other customers. Your call will be answered in the order in which it was received” and “Can I get your account information again?” For quick solutions to small specific problems, try online chats, Ms. Yarrow said. They are ideal for handling issues like a promotion code or learning when your product will arrive. “This isn’t the place for empathy or to complain,” she said. Check a company’s Facebook or Twitter profile because some are savvy social media users, said Justin Robbins, the content director for the customer management institute. Other experts, though, have said that companies are largely slow to respond to complaints posted there, and that social media should be a last resort. Write down as many details as possible, such as the name of the person you are talking to. Ask how the company is tracking you  —   is it by your name, or either a phone, account or case number? All of that can be useful if you need to follow up, Mr. Robbins said. You can ask to “escalate” a call, which is lingo for wanting to speak with a supervisor. Be clear about what you want, said C. William Crutcher, the president of the National Customer Service Association. After outlining your issue, wait for a response. Don’t continue to talk and repeat your request. It is likely the representative got the message the first time. No matter how frustrated you are, remain calm and treat representatives with “the utmost dignity,” Mr. Broetzmann said. Experts suggest referring to the representatives by name because it signals you are interested in working with them. Research recently published by the University of British Columbia in The Journal of Applied Psychology suggested the quality of service received by customers was determined by what customers said to a representative. “For example, personally targeting employees by saying, ‘Your product is garbage’ instead of ‘This product is garbage,’ can trigger negative responses from service employees,” the researchers said in a statement. The researchers analyzed 36 hours of calls between customers and employees at a Canadian call center. When customers were not aggressive, fewer than 5 percent of the calls had problems. But researchers found that when customers used   pronouns  —   such as “you” or “your”  —   and interrupted, the service worsened in more than 35 percent of the calls. For companies, customer service is more than an exercise in public relations. The customer rage study, drawing on several sets of data, extrapolated that businesses risked losing more than $202 billion in 2015 as a result of serious problems with their products and services. As the customer management institute’s report observed, “If organizations don’t get on board with meeting customer expectations, they’ll soon discover that they may not have many customers left around to serve. ”	1
564	 A Denny’s waitress was allegedly assaulted by two Muslim men for serving pork during Ramadan.The woman, an 18 year old that had just graduated high school, was working at a local Denny’s restaurant when she was reportedly insulted by two passers-by on Wednesday.The men are said to have started to abuse her when they saw she was serving bacon to customers, The Times reported.She said one of the men screamed she was a “whore” and slapped her across the face, leaving her with a black eye after she was knocked to the ground.Police said they had identified the men using CCTV but had yet to locate them. An online news report described an incident involving two Muslims assaulting a Denny’s waitress in Round Rock for serving pork during Ramadan.The only issue is the story is a complete fabrication.The story, posted by JTXH News on June 9, states the 18-year-old waitress was called a “whore” and slapped across the face, causing a black eye. Police used camera footage to identify the two men, the story reads, but had yet to locate the suspects. The story refers to information from “The Times,” but does not include a hyperlink.Round Rock police spokesperson Angelique Myers said there is no truth to the story. “The website is not one bit credible,” she said by email.Alfonso Ruiz, an operating partner for the Denny’s restaurants in Round Rock and New Braunfels, said the corporate arm of the restaurant franchise made him aware of the story.“It’s unbelievable because I’m in my restaurant all the time,” he said. “I don’t know how they’d come up with a story like this.”Ruiz said he was attempting to contact someone at the news site, but could not reach anyone. The site does not include any contact information, and refers to its writers only by their first name. Ruiz noted that even the image used with the story is not the Denny’s in Round Rock.	0
305	Let’s say Donald J. Trump wants to make good on his promise to improve the lives of American workers. Let’s imagine this White House, which came to power free from the political debts typically owed to unions or Wall Street, is genuinely focused on helping the nation’s miners, waitresses and Uber drivers. What, then, should President Trump do? The question might seem fanciful given the continuing chaos in Washington. But with Mr. Trump’s new choice for labor secretary, R. Alexander Acosta, heading toward a likely confirmation, at some point the president’s cabinet will actually start governing. And then, it will face an unusual opportunity: the freedom to create policies potentially beholden only to the American workers who put Mr. Trump into office. This is a potentially transformative moment, not just within politics, but also inside millions of companies grappling with a changing economy and expanding worker demands. So over the past few weeks, I asked more than two dozen labor thinkers  —   from both the right and left former officials and government skeptics union leaders and strident capitalists  —   what kinds of federal innovations could remake American working life. I particularly asked for bipartisan ideas. In general, and surprisingly, there is broad enthusiasm about the future of American work (even as there are sharp disagreements about whether this president’s policies will help or hurt workers). “There are lots of new opportunities we wouldn’t have even dreamed about a few decades ago,” said Andy Stern, former president of the S. E. I. U. one of the largest labor unions. “There are great ideas out there, and people who want to experiment. But so much depends on what the government is willing to encourage. ” In particular, say both corporate chieftains and organized labor advocates, there is an opportunity for agencies like the Labor Department to become innovation catalysts, using technology to rethink how workers are trained and find jobs. The government could revolutionize employee benefits by making them more portable. And federal departments could become knowledge centers, spreading good ideas from state to state. Many of these ideas draw on the creativity that has remade places like Silicon Valley. Take, for instance, how the internet has changed the way   workers find jobs. “You don’t find a lot of   workers on LinkedIn,” said Seth Harris, deputy labor secretary under President Barack Obama. “But the unemployment system reaches tens of millions of   workers each year. If government got more sophisticated about using technology to train workers with the skills companies need, and to encourage online job matching, that could transform things. ” Improving job training isn’t a   concept. Nearly every major university and college now offers online curriculums that evolve, semester to semester, in response to new technologies or what employers say they are looking for. But those innovations have not much influenced how the Labor Department spends billions each year on training for unemployed workers. “There’s strong bipartisan support for work force development,” Mr. Harris said. “But right now, the private sector changes so quickly that by the time we get a training program in place to help    truck drivers learn computer programming, what we’re teaching is out of date. We can change that. ” What’s more, the Labor Department is perfectly poised to use technology to reduce what is known as “frictional unemployment”  —   in which jobs go unfilled because workers and companies have trouble finding each other. Most online career marketplaces, like LinkedIn, cater to   professionals. But, as Mr. Harris pointed out, LinkedIn is not primarily designed to help waiters or home health aides find work. And because such workers often have less money to pay for online memberships, those kinds of networks are less likely to emerge on their own. However, Mr. Trump’s new labor secretary could create those marketplaces, as well as encourage companies to train people on the job. “We need more apprenticeship programs,” said Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine. Right now, such programs are hobbled by regulations that make it hard for companies to take on midcareer interns. But “there’s support from both parties for helping workers learn,” Ms. Collins said. “That’s not a partisan issue. ” This White House could also expand the concept of employment to benefit the millions of Americans who are freelancers, independent contractors or otherwise part of the “gig economy. ” “If you make it easier to hire more people, that’s both   and ” said Oren Cass, the domestic policy director of Mitt Romney’s presidential campaign. But in recent decades, as courts and regulators tussled over what, exactly, constitutes an employee, “we’ve made it harder to hire, even as it’s gotten easier to become Uber, a company that succeeds with hardly any formal employees,” Mr. Cass said. Companies like Uber are terrified to offer benefits like health care. At Uber, for example, that increases the chances that a court will declare a driver an employee, which requires Uber to pay insurance and taxes, and makes the company liable if a driver harasses a passenger or causes an accident. “But what if there was a category of employment that was somewhere between a   employee and an independent contractor?” Mr. Cass asked. “What if Uber could say to a driver, ‘We’re willing to contribute to your health care costs, but we don’t want to be on the hook for everything. ’” Creating a new category of employment could be risky for workers. Companies could opt to do away with formal employees altogether, and make it harder for workers to organize to fight for their rights. But such innovations could also be paired with flexible protections for workers, like “portable benefits. ” Government policies could let employees transfer their health care plans or 401( k) accounts as easily as they switch cellphone carriers. That might push companies to compete for workers with the same ferocity that Verizon battles ATT. Ideas like these have been around for a while, but have been stymied by old political divisions. Mr. Trump, however, is a disruptive force. “There’s an opportunity right now for the Labor Department to redefine its role, to help people stop thinking about the relationship between companies and workers as always ” said Eric Liu, a former policy adviser to President Bill Clinton and author of the forthcoming “You’re More Powerful Than You Think: A Citizen’s Guide to Making Change Happen. ” “If Trump is smart, he’ll start stealing ideas from the right and left,” Mr. Liu added. He could also steal from successful companies by publicizing good ideas. Companies like Costco and Allstate, which have prospered by giving employees higher wages and better benefits, deserve more attention. They haven’t been feted by this administration yet, but they should be. The White House should also propagandize the workplace nudges and experiments that help both workers and a company’s bottom line. It is, of course, unclear if these are the kinds of ideas Mr. Trump or his cabinet will embrace. But there are strong reasons to hope they might. Mr. Trump was elected largely by workers. He is, uniquely, a president not beholden to union orthodoxies or industrial dogmas. “I’ve always referred to the Department of Labor as the Department of Opportunity,” said Thomas E. Perez, who served as secretary of labor under Mr. Obama and is now running to head the Democratic National Committee. In the most recent election, workers showed how powerfully they can upend political prognostications when they want to  —   and how much they are willing to cross party lines to get what they want. “I’m not at all convinced Trump actually cares about workers,” Mr. Perez said. “But I’m willing to be surprised. ”	1
760	 The mysterious disappearance of a 38-year-old Little Rock, Arkansas woman is finally over, after finding Andrea Reynolds remains in a basement freezer of her ex-fiancé’s house.  The video recorded confession of Jimmy Roberts sent chills up the spines of investigators. The following is part of the transcript released by Little Rock, Arkansas investigators:“I caught her cheating on me and I lost it … I killed her and her boyfriend. I had to come up with something quick. So I reported her missing. Everybody began to search for her so of course I joined in. Every week we had meetings at my house and I barbecued for all the volunteers. But what they didn’t know is I put Andrea and her boyfriend in the meat grinder, made her into burger patties, and fed her to her parents. They were always so mean to me, all I could do was look at them and smile. Revenge never tasted so sweet. They had no idea! Well now they know!”	0

5	■ President Trump met with airline industry executives and complained that “we spent six trillion dollars in the Middle East, we got nothing. ” ■ Representative Tom Price could finally get a vote as soon as Friday to be confirmed as secretary of health and human services. ■ Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, and Senator Patty Murray of Washington, the ranking Democrat on the labor committee, are going after Andrew Puzder, Mr. Trump’s embattled nominee for labor secretary. It was a bit of a    moment when Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, told reporters that President Trump’s nominee for the Supreme Court, Judge Neil M. Gorsuch, had called Mr. Trump’s attacks on the judiciary “demoralizing” and “disheartening. ” The account was readily confirmed on the record by a White House adviser, Ron Bonjean, working to advance the Gorsuch confirmation. But that wasn’t enough to stop the president from going after Mr. Bluementhal where it hurt: The president was referring to 2010 news, broken in The New York Times, a media outlet he has openly criticized, that Mr. Blumenthal had  exaggerated his   service. The president, who might want to be making friends with the senators who need to confirm Judge Gorsuch, tipped his hand as to what news program he was watching Thursday morning: CNN, where Mr. Blumenthal was being interviewed. Mr. Trump registered his discontent. Actually, Mr. Cuomo did ask about Mr. Blumenthal’s service, he said. It is also unclear what was “fake” about a story that relied as much on the people shepherding the Gorsuch nomination through the Senate as on one of the senators who will cast a vote. Senator Ben Sasse, Republican of Nebraska, confirmed the Blumenthal account Thursday morning, as did former Senator Kelly Ayotte, a Republican and one of Judge Gorsuch’s shepherds. Mr. Cuomo also did not ask the senator about the president’s bone spurs. Maybe he was just not positively disposed toward the United States Senate Thursday morning. After taking a whack at Senator Blumenthal, Mr. Trump turned to an old nemesis, Senator John McCain of Arizona, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, whose actual Vietnam heroism, beyond dispute, was disparaged by Mr. Trump. This time, the president was unhappy that Mr. McCain had suggested that the recent raid in Yemen that resulted in the death of an American commando, multiple civilians and possibly a child who was an American citizen was not a success. The president’s tweets came after his press secretary, Sean Spicer, asserted Wednesday that the senator owed an apology to Chief Petty Officer William “Ryan” Owens, who lost his life in the raid. Mr. McCain offered no such thing. “When you lose a $75 million airplane and, more importantly, an American life is lost, I don’t believe you can call it a success,” he told NBC News. Jeff Sessions’ bruising confirmation as attorney general Wednesday evening set off a predictable flurry of news releases that declared the   Alabama senator to be a great American who would “make America a safer place” (the National Rifle Association) or “a lap dog” and a “dangerous gamble” (the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence). But for all the bombastic pronouncements, a more measured,   note came from, wait for it, the pot industry. Mr. Sessions has been a longtime foe of legalizing marijuana, but the National Cannabis Industry Association was totally chill. “We look forward” to working with Mr. Sessions to maintain the Justice Department’s current   approach to state marijuana policies, the association said. “We will work with him to do that,” the industry said cheerfully. In other words, don’t bogart that joint, my friend. When President Trump met with the airline industry on Thursday, the executives had plenty to complain about: an air traffic control system that is out of date, an airport infrastructure that is failing, computers that are melting down. And in the president, the executives found a sympathetic ear. Airports are getting “the wrong stuff,” he said. The air traffic control network is “a system that’s totally out of whack. ” Why? “We spent six trillion dollars in the Middle East, we got nothing,” the president said. “And we have an obsolete plane system, we have obsolete airports. ” The day President Trump took the oath of office, he filed paperwork to declare his candidacy for   not so much because he was overeager but because money was still flowing into his campaign coffers, and any funds raised over $5, 000 in 2017 would have had to be returned unless Mr. Trump registered as a candidate. And we know the president doesn’t like refunds. So what’s a federal employee to do with a boss who was technically running for office the day he stepped into the Oval Office? The Office of Special Counsel has answers. It has told federal employees that they may not express a view about whether Mr. Trump should be   or defeated in 2020 while on duty or in the workplace, but it assured them that they were otherwise free to express support or disapproval about Mr. Trump and his policies. A new guidance document was issued on Tuesday after the office said that it had received numerous inquiries about the impact of Mr. Trump’s filing for  . In contrast, former President Barack Obama filed such paperwork more than two years after his inauguration. The office  —   an independent agency that watchdogs   protections  —   said that with the exception of expressly advocating Mr. Trump’s success or failure in the 2020 election, federal employees were still pretty free. “Because the 2020 election is still more than three years away, at this time not all expressions of support or opposition to President Trump constitute political activity for purposes of the Hatch Act,” which prohibits federal employees from politicking, it said. The office also developed a new answer to its list of frequently asked questions that spells out with greater detail the scope and limits of federal employees’ right to express their views while they are at work or on duty. The new answer distinguished between expressing a view about current events, policy issues and matters of public interest  —   which federal employees are always free to do  —   and political activity, meaning advocating the success or failure of a particular political candidate or party. For example, it said, federal employees on duty or in the workplace are free to say “I agree with health care reform,” but not, “If you disagree with health care reform you should support candidate X. ” Andrew Puzder, the chief executive of the   corporation that gave the world Carl’s Jr. Hardee’s, and racy ads of   women eating large hamburgers, is finally getting his confirmation hearing (on Feb. 16) after multiple delays. And Democrats see a cabinet nominee they may just be able to derail. Senator Chuck Schumer, the Democratic minority leader, called on the president to withdraw Mr. Puzder’s nomination, describing his business record as “ . ” He also picked up the conservatives’ war cry, assailing Mr. Puzder for hiring an undocumented immigrant to clean his house. “They ought to withdraw Puzder’s nomination before he further embarrasses this administration and further exposes the hypocrisy of President Trump in saying one thing to the workers of America and doing another,” Mr. Schumer said. Momentum may be building. Democrats have attacked his record at CKE, the parent company of the   chains. Opponents have moved to unseal divorce records, which may contain details of domestic violence accusations leveled by his   then retracted. And until Mr. Schumer chimed in, conservatives  —   led by the White House adviser Steve Bannon’s Breitbart News  —   were the leading voices attacking Mr. Puzder for employing an undocumented immigrant. Well, if he doesn’t get confirmed, Mr. Puzder will have a nest egg to fall back on. Ethics documents released Wednesday night showed that he pulled in a $3. 4 million salary last year, owns as much as $55 million in company stock that he must divest himself of, expects a bonus of $1 million to $5 million and even secured a relocation benefit worth between $250, 000 and $500, 000. And he would not be nearly the richest member of the cabinet. Budget season is fast approaching on Capitol Hill, and Defense Secretary Jim Mattis met for a private breakfast on Wednesday with the lawmakers who will largely decide on the Pentagon’s coming request for more money to increase what President Trump has said are the nation’s badly “depleted” armed forces. Mr. Mattis and top aides met with the senior Republican and Democrat on the House and Senate Armed Services Committees, and their counterparts on the House and Senate Appropriations Committees that control the Pentagon’s purse strings. The big   is complicated, however. Under the terms of the 2011 Budget Control Act, both domestic and military spending is subject to hard, statutory budget caps. Republicans want to lift those caps for the Defense Department. Democrats insist that they will go along only if the caps are raised for domestic spending as well. For a guy who famously  —   and rightly  —   rejected the polls that showed he would not win the presidency, Mr. Trump has suddenly become quite enamored with those surveys. Vexed by the federal courts and questioned by the press, the president has turned to public opinion to bolster his policies, especially his temporary ban on visas to travelers from seven predominantly Muslim nations. And it’s not just polls of Americans. Hey, polls of Europeans back him up too. And of course, polls also back up his feeling for the news media  —   which, as you might have noticed, he doesn’t like.	1
440	KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia  —   Two women were charged with murder in a Kuala Lumpur court on Wednesday in connection with the assassination of Kim   the estranged half brother of the North Korean leader, Kim  . Siti Aisyah, 25, of Indonesia, and Doan Thi Huong, 28, of Vietnam, could receive the death penalty. The police said the two women rubbed a deadly nerve agent on Mr. Kim’s face as he prepared to check in for a flight at Kuala Lumpur International Airport on the morning of Feb. 13. The women were charged as North Korea began a diplomatic effort to repair the damage from the killing, sending delegations to Beijing and Kuala Lumpur in a rare bit of outreach by the reclusive nation as it faced accusations that it had carried out the brazen assassination. The delegation to Beijing was led by Vice Foreign Minister Ri   said the North’s official Korean Central News Agency, which did not provide further details. The Chinese Foreign Ministry confirmed that Mr. Ri was visiting at its invitation and would meet with China’s foreign minister, Wang Yi. Mr. Ri is the most senior North Korean official to visit Beijing since a delegation met with President Xi Jinping of China in May. His trip came five days after the North lashed out at China in unusually bitter language for tightening sanctions by suspending all coal imports from North Korea for the rest of the year, depriving North Korea of one of its most important sources of hard currency. The two women charged in Mr. Kim’s murder were arrested soon after the Feb. 13 attack and have said they thought they were participating in a prank. The police have also arrested a North Korean man, Ri   and are seeking seven others. South Korean officials have accused the North Korean government of ordering the assassination. There was no word yet on whether Malaysian officials would charge Ri   in the attack. With relations between Malaysia and North Korea fraying over the killing, a   North Korean delegation, including the former deputy ambassador to the United Nations, Ri   arrived in the Malaysian capital to discuss taking Mr. Kim’s body to North Korea, the South Korean news agency Yonhap reported from Kuala Lumpur. Ri   the envoy, said he also would demand the release of Ri   Yonhap reported. “We are here to discuss human rights issues and find an agreement,” Mr. Ri told reporters outside the North Korean Embassy. North Korea is widely considered to have one of the world’s worst human rights records, one that includes enslavement and torture of political prisoners, extrajudicial executions and forced abortions. Mr. Ri also said he would discuss “strengthening friendly relations” with Malaysia. Whether Malaysia is prepared to discuss friendly relations remains to be seen. Officials at the Malaysian Foreign Ministry declined to comment on the standoff over the release of the body and the detention of the North Korean suspect.	1
266	Being part of the global billionaire class is beyond the imagination of most people. At the threshold of $1 billion, a 5 percent return would yield an annual interest payment of $50 million  —   without ever touching the principal. But how billionaires, from those in the single digits to near the top, invest shows a range of options for the very wealthiest in the world. One thing they all have in common is a large amount of money in cash or equivalently liquid securities. Here’s a look at how 10 billionaires have made and invested their money, according to public filings gathered by the financial research firm  .  Chairman of LVMHEstimated net worth: $38. 1 billion Bernard Arnault, 67, is the richest man in France. Trained as a civil engineer, he got his start in business from his father, who had a successful construction company. He shifted the focus of his father’s company to real estate and then turned his eye to luxury goods. Through his Groupe Arnault, the   Parisian sits at the helm of the luxury goods companies Christian Dior and LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton. He is also a major art collector, having acquired works by Pablo Picasso and Andy Warhol. His vast wealth sits predominantly in companies he controls. He has $34. 8 billion held among Christian Dior, LVMH and Carrefour, a French retail chain. The next largest distribution is in cash at $2. 9 billion this is money from salaries, dividends and holdings that give him liquidity when he needs it. Then come the homes. He has a mansion in Paris worth $55 million and a home in the Bahamas worth $30 million, as well as yachts and art. His wealth shows how a single concentrated position in a company can increase your worth tremendously. Former chief executive of MicrosoftEstimated net worth: $30. 8 billion Steven A. Ballmer, 60, scored a perfect 800 on the mathematics portion of the SAT and punched his ticket from an elite private school in Detroit to Harvard University. In his sophomore year, he lived in the same dorm as Bill Gates, the   of Microsoft. In 1980, he dropped out of Stanford University’s business school to start working for Mr. Gates. He was paid $50, 000 but given a stake in the nascent company. He rose to become chief executive in 2000  —   a post he held for nearly 14 years. Shortly after stepping down, he bought the Los Angeles Clippers basketball team for a record $2 billion. The team had been mired in controversy with a previous owner, Donald Sterling. Even though Mr. Ballmer left Microsoft, the vast bulk of his wealth remains in company stock  —   $21. 4 billion. He has $7. 3 billion more in cash. It makes his stake in the Clippers seems paltry. He also has $450 million in Twitter shares. He owns a $14 million home in Hunts Point, Wash. and properties on Whidbey Island worth about $4 million. Deputy chairwoman of AltanaEstimated net worth: $20 billion Susanne Klatten, 54, the richest woman in Germany, can trace the source of her wealth to “the ultimate driving machine,” BMW. Her grandfather founded an industrial conglomerate that owned the German automotive company  —   and had a stake in its more staid rival,  . The company also owned the chemical giant Altana. Her father, Herbert Quandt, took over the family businesses when his father died in 1954. When he died in 1982, Ms. Klatten received stakes in BMW and Altana, of which she is now the sole owner. As her father was credited with saving BMW from bankruptcy, she is credited with making Altana a top company in Germany. She is also chairwoman of the SGL Group, which produces graphite and   products. Her wealth is tied up in her companies, with over half, or $12. 1 billion, in the BMW Group. An additional 16 percent is in Altana, and 1 percent is in the SGL Group. She has 22. 5 percent in cash. She has a family office that creates privacy around the breakdown of her wealth. Chairman of WiproEstimated net worth: $10 billion Azim Premji, 71, was born into the family that started Western India Vegetable Products, which produced hydrogenated oils. When Mr. Premji was at Stanford University, his father, who started the company, died, and he left college to take it over. At 23, he became chief executive. He diversified the   company’s offerings into soap and baby care products. In 1981, he ventured into information technology. The company boomed through the 1980s and ’90s, and in 2000 the renamed Wipro went public in New York. In 2009, Mr. Premji handed over the    running of the company. He devotes time to philanthropy, having given half his Wipro shares to a charity that supports education and health causes in India. His wealth appears to remain fairly concentrated, with 64 percent of it in Wipro shares. An additional 13 percent is in a related company, Wipro Enterprises, and 20 percent is shielded by his family office. Public records show that he has a $20 million stake in JM Financial (about 0. 2 percent of his wealth) $180 million in cash and $1 million in property in Mumbai. Given his total worth, his properties and holdings are probably much greater, but he has structured his wealth to protect his privacy. Director of 3G Capital Estimated net worth: $8. 6 billion Carlos Alberto Sicupira, who turns 69 this year, hails from São Paulo, Brazil, which ranks just behind New York City (where he keeps a residence) for the most billionaires in the Americas. He began his career in finance at Banco de Investimentos Garantia. He later served as chief executive of Lojas Americanas, a Brazilian shopping chain. He is a founder of 3G Capital, a private equity firm that has become known in recent years for partnering with Warren E. Buffett, the   man in the world, on deals like the acquisition of Heinz in 2013 and, two years later, its merger with Kraft. Much of Mr. Sicupira’s wealth rests in a series of deals 3G did with breweries starting in 1999. He has a $5. 8 billion stake in the combined   InBev, which accounts for nearly 67 percent of his wealth. He has nearly $1 billion more in 3G itself. He still holds a $220 million stake in Lojas Americanas, where he remains chairman. He has an additional $1. 6 billion in cash and a $2. 5 million apartment on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan. Owner of the Arison GroupEstimated net worth: $5. 6 billion Shari Arison, 59, was born in New York but splits her time now between Tel Aviv and Miami. Her father, Ted Arison, started Carnival Cruise Line in 1972. In 1990, he moved back to Tel Aviv, where he was born, and established Arison Investments. It later acquired Bank Hapoalim, Israel’s largest bank, and renamed itself the Arison Group. It has investments in finance, real estate, infrastructure, renewable energy and water. When her father died in 1999, Ms. Arison inherited 35 percent of his wealth. (She has a brother, Micky, who owns the Miami Heat basketball team.) As owner of the Arison Group and a philanthropist, she promotes good deeds. The investment group’s motto is “Doing good is good for business,” and through her charity she has sponsored Good Deeds Day, which encourages people to volunteer. Ms. Arison’s wealth is divided fairly evenly among different investments. She owns $1. 6 billion of stock in Carnival Cruise Line, $1. 6 billion of stock in Bank Hapoalim, $1. 1 billion in the Arison Group itself and holds $1 billion in cash. She has a stake in an Israeli housing and infrastructure company and homes in the Bal Harbour section of Miami and in Tel Aviv. Executive chairman of Shenzhou International Group HoldingsEstimated net worth: $4. 3 billion Ever worn Nike, Adidas, Puma or Uniqlo? Those items may have come from one of Ma Jianrong’s factories. His company is the leading textile manufacturer in China. Mr. Ma, 52, began working in the textile industry as a teenager and later earned a master’s degree from Zhejiang University of Technology. His father, Ma Baoxing, was chairman of the weaving company that became Shenzhou International Group Holdings. In the late 1990s, the younger Mr. Ma took over the company and increased its revenue and net profit by 23 times in seven years. A member of the Chinese Communist Party, he is an official in the Zhejiang Provincial People’s Congress. The exact composition of his wealth is hard to determine. He seems to have about $340 million in cash, with the rest in Shenzhou International Group Holdings. Executive chairman of African Rainbow MineralsEstimated net worth: $2. 1 billion Patrice Motsepe, 55, was born in Johannesburg and began his career as a lawyer with American firms in South Africa. He attended university and law school during the apartheid era and practiced law for six years, becoming the first black partner in a South African law firm. In 1994, after Nelson Mandela became the country’s first black president, Mr. Motsepe quit law to start Future Mining, a mining services company. With that as his start, he began acquiring mines and other mining companies. By 2004, the accumulated entities became African Rainbow Minerals. He owns the Mamelodi Sundowns Football Club, a soccer team in South Africa’s premier league, and last year he started a private equity firm and financial services company. His wealth, which places him among South Africa’s richest people, is well diversified. The largest portion of his wealth, 36 percent, is in cash and its equivalents. He has nearly 30 percent in Africa Rainbow Minerals, and a similar amount in Sanlam, a financial services firm of which he is deputy chairman. Some 5 percent of his wealth is in the Harmony Gold Mining Company. Two homes are worth $7 million, or   of 1 percent of his wealth.   of the Panda Restaurant GroupEstimated net worth: $1. 5 billion In search of quick Chinese food? Panda Express, with its 1, 900 locations around the United States, is there to serve some up. Peggy Cherng, 69, founded the chain with her husband, Andrew. When the restaurant began expanding from Glendale, Calif. into the   chain it is today, she used her science background to make the business   early on and then applied her knowledge of logistics to streamline the process. Ms. Cherng, who was born in Myanmar (then Burma) was raised in Hong Kong and met her husband at Baker University in Kansas. She holds a master’s degree in computer science and a Ph. D. in electrical engineering, and began her career at the defense contractor McDonnell Douglas. She and her husband live in California. Her largest holding is in the Panda Restaurant Group, which also owns Panda Inn. It is worth $1. 2 billion, or 77 percent of her wealth. Nearly 19 percent of her wealth is in cash. She also has a large position, some $60 million, in the Golden Eagle Retail Group, a real estate development company. The rest of her wealth is in three homes in California. Chief executive of InstagramEstimated net worth: $1. 2 billion Smile, you’re a billionaire. Kevin Systrom, 33, is a founder of the   site Instagram, on which Beyoncé announced her latest pregnancy and set a record for most shares. Mr. Systrom went to Stanford University and, after graduating in 2006, put in time at Google before venturing out on his own. In 2010, he and a friend got the idea for Instagram. Two years later, the company was acquired by Facebook for $1 billion in cash and stock. He owned 40 percent of the company. He remains the chief executive. Mr. Systrom’s wealth is tied to Facebook  —   at 88 percent. But he has about $160 million in cash. He also has $600, 000 in Walmart stock from his role as a director of the company and the chairman of its technology and   committee.	1
237	On any given weekend, you might catch President Trump’s    and top Mideast dealmaker, Jared Kushner, by the beachside   ice cream machine, or his reclusive chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon, on the dining patio. If you are lucky, the president himself could stop by your table for a quick chat. But you will have to pay $200, 000 for the privilege  —   and the few available spots are going fast. Virtually overnight,    Mr. Trump’s   Palm Beach, Fla. club, has been transformed into the   capital of American government, a   winter White House where Mr. Trump has entertained a foreign head of state, health care industry executives and other presidential guests. But Mr. Trump’s gatherings at     —   he arrived there on Friday afternoon, his third weekend visit in a row  —   have also created an arena for potential political influence rarely seen in American history: a kind of Washington steakhouse on steroids, situated in a sunny playground of the rich and powerful, where members and their guests enjoy a level of access that could elude even the   of lobbyists. Membership lists reviewed by The New York Times show that the club’s nearly 500 paying members include dozens of real estate developers, Wall Street financiers, energy executives and others whose businesses could be affected by Mr. Trump’s policies. At least three club members are under consideration for an ambassadorship. Most of the 500 have had memberships predating Mr. Trump’s presidential campaign, and there are a limited number of memberships still available. William I. Koch, who oversees a major mining and fuels company, belongs to    as does the billionaire trader Thomas Peterffy, who spent more than $8 million on political ads in 2012 warning of creeping socialism in America. Another member is George Norcross, an insurance executive and the South Jersey Democratic Party boss, whose friendship with Mr. Trump dates to the president’s Atlantic City years, when Mr. Norcross held insurance contracts with Mr. Trump’s casinos, and Mr. Trump wrangled with the state’s Democratic leaders over tax treatment of the properties. Yet another member is Janet Weiner, part owner and chief financial officer of the Rockstar energy drink company, which has spent hundreds of thousands of dollars lobbying federal officials to avoid tighter regulations on its products. Bruce Toll, a real estate executive who   Toll Brothers, one of the nation’s largest home builders, and who is still active in the industry, owns a home nearby and frequently sees Mr. Trump at    he said. While they did not discuss any of Mr. Toll’s specific projects, he said, the two would occasionally discuss national issues, such as Mr. Trump’s plans to increase spending on highways and other infrastructure projects. “Maybe you ought to do this or that,” Mr. Toll said of the kind of advice that Mr. Trump got from club members. Mr. Trump’s son Eric, in an interview on Friday, rejected suggestions that his family was offering access to his father and profiting from it. First, he said, only 20 to 40 new members are admitted per year, and second, the wealthy business executives who frequent the club, among others, have many ways to communicate with the federal government if they want to. “It assumes the worst of us and everyone, and that is unfair,” Eric Trump said. Hope Hicks, a White House spokeswoman, said the president had no conflicts of interest, a reference to the fact that federal law exempts him from provisions prohibiting federal employees from taking actions that could benefit themselves financially. “But regardless, he has not and will not be discussing policy with club members,” she said in a written statement.    she added, is “one of the most successful private clubs in the world,” and it “was intended to be the Southern White House, and the president looks forward to hosting many world leaders at this remarkable property. ” But unlike the real White House, it has no public access, and no official visitor log is available. When members of the White House press corps accompanied Mr. Trump to the club and nearby golf course last weekend, they were housed during part of the trip in a room whose windows had been covered with black plastic.    members and their guests, on the other hand, had a   seat to a brewing foreign policy crisis, when Mr. Trump and his aides huddled on the dining patio to devise a response to North Korea’s launch of an   ballistic missile in the middle of a dinner with Shinzo Abe, the Japanese prime minister, and his wife. “No one needs to have a long   with Donald Trump,” said Robert Weissman, the president of Public Citizen, a nonpartisan watchdog group. “If you can whisper in his ear for 40 seconds, that can be decisive on your policy. ” Mr. Koch  —   the estranged brother of his   siblings, Charles G. and David H.  —   owns a home in Palm Beach and hosted a   for Mr. Trump during the campaign. His company, Oxbow Carbon, is among the world’s largest sellers of petroleum coke, an oil byproduct, and would be a significant beneficiary of the Keystone XL pipeline, construction of which is now a Trump administration priority. Brad Goldstein, a spokesman for William Koch, said that he did not know whether the two men had ever discussed policy matters. “If I did know,” Mr. Goldstein added, “the answer would be that I decline to comment. ” Historically, of course, American presidents have often been rich men with mansions, who sometimes conducted the people’s business in weekend haunts of the wealthy: the Bush compound in Kennebunkport, Me. for example, or the Kennedy family home in Hyannisport, Mass. President Dwight D. Eisenhower joined the elite Augusta National Golf Club before he was elected, frequently hanging out there with a group of affluent businessmen who became known as “the gang,” which included top executives from   and an oil company, an investment banker and a   . But Mr. Trump’s weekend White House appears to be unprecedented in American history, as it is the first one with customers paying a company owned by the president, several historians said. “   represents a commercialization of the presidency that has few if any precedents in American history,” said Jon Meacham, a presidential historian and Andrew Jackson biographer. “Presidents have always spent time with the affluent,” he added. “But a club where people pay you as president to spend time in his company is new. It is kind of amazing. ” John Dean, who served as White House counsel during the Nixon administration and has been a frequent Trump critic, noted that President Richard M. Nixon used to fly down to Florida to stay in an earlier winter White House: a private home in Key Biscayne that had also earned that name. But that arrangement was entirely different, Mr. Dean said, as Mr. Nixon was staying at a private home, not surrounded by some of the nation’s wealthiest business executives. “Most presidents feel very strongly about the dignity of the office they hold,” Mr. Dean said. “Mr. Trump has busted every norm in campaigning, and he seems to be doing the same with the traditions of his office. ” One longtime member is Kenneth M. Duberstein, who served as White House chief of staff under President Ronald Reagan and who now works as a corporate consultant and lobbyist. Clients of Mr. Duberstein’s firm include Alibaba Group, the Chinese internet company Amgen and Pfizer, the pharmaceutical giants and Dow Chemical and America’s Health Insurance Plans, which represents the nation’s largest health insurers. Like other members interviewed for this article, Mr. Duberstein said he did not bring up business matters with any Trump administration officials when visiting the club, which also is near a home he owns. “It is a social thing,” he said. “It is not a business thing. ” Christopher Ruddy, the chief executive of Newsmax Media and a longtime donor to and a friend of the president, said Mr. Trump had always conducted what amounted to informal focus groups on a variety of topics, but that face time with him since the election had become restricted to family and old friends. “It’s a myth to think that anybody could just join the club and go speak to the president,” Mr. Ruddy said, adding that the Secret Service has instituted a de facto rope line around the president’s table in recent weeks, which several other club members confirmed. But the weekly gatherings at    have already drawn some scrutiny from Democrats in the Senate, who called for Mr. Trump to release a list of all of the members. “Your winter White House will provide an audience with you for those who can afford it, not to mention an increasing   into your   organization,” Senators Sheldon Whitehouse, Democrat of Rhode Island, and Tom Udall, Democrat of New Mexico, wrote in a letter sent to Mr. Trump this month. “Instead of draining the swamp, it appears you’re bringing Washington right to the swamps at   . ”    has never been snooty in the manner of some private clubs in Palm Beach under Mr. Trump, it has long welcomed Jews, gay couples, Republicans and Democrats. (So long as they could afford the entry fee, that is:    doubled that fee to $200, 000 shortly after Mr. Trump was elected members also pay $14, 000 in annual dues.) Mr. Trump spent years populating his club with people rejected by rival clubs, while also urging his friends to join. Several members said Mr. Trump’s pronouncements on   topics such as immigration  —   and in particular his recent move to ban visas for visitors from certain nations  —   had caused some friction among the members at   . But Bernd Lembcke, the club’s managing director, said that applications had risen since Mr. Trump’s election. “It enhances it  —   his presidency does,” Mr. Lembcke said, referring to membership in the club. “People are now even more interested in becoming members. But we are very careful in vetting them. ” And potential members must be sponsored by a current one, he said. “You still have to be introduced. ” The list of members is a who’s who of the world of global finance and real estate, but it is also sprinkled with other boldface names, like Howie Carr, the Boston radio show host, and Bill Belichick, the head coach of the New England Patriots, according to three lists reviewed by The Times, from 2015 through earlier this year. Several members are also major campaign contributors to Mr. Trump, like Mr. Ruddy and Brian Burns, a businessman and lawyer whom Mr. Trump has indicated he now intends to nominate as ambassador to Ireland, records show. One longtime member is Richard LeFrak, a fellow New York developer and one of Mr. Trump’s closest friends, who in turn has recruited some of his own friends to join. Jeff Greene, a Senate candidate in Florida in 2010, said he had joined at the urging of Mr. LeFrak. But    where Mr. Trump’s old New York circle blurs easily into his presidency, is now a place where the president of the United States might seek guidance on a major government project the way another New Yorker might ask around for a good orthopedist. When Mr. LeFrak paid a visit to Mr. Trump at    last weekend, he appeared a little startled when Mr. Trump, in a brief interlude during the conversation, told him that the Department of Homeland Security was quoting a price of more than $20 billion for the proposed border wall with Mexico. “He said, would I consider doing it? And then he suggested that the price that was being quoted in the media seemed absurdly high to him,” Mr. LeFrak said. He is not interested in the work, but said, “And I didn’t react to him one way or the other because I don’t know what the facts are. ” Mr. LeFrak said to the president, “I thought you were going to have homeland security deal with this,” he recalled, describing Mr. Trump as stymied by the bureaucracy. “And he said, ‘Yes, maybe General Kelly will call you. ’”	1
928	 Is it true that giant mutant Fukushima hornets are killing people in the United States? In the wake of the world’s most catastrophic nuclear disaster, hospitals in central Nebraska have recently been reporting several deaths caused by a particularly venomous species of Asian wasp that has found its way into the states.It was reported that these pests have been contaminated by radioactive debris from the failed Fukushima power plant. This has caused them to nearly quadruple in size, and become hyper aggressive.As if that wasn’t horrific enough, the giant hornet also possesses venom which is nearly 2000 times stronger than that of the common wasp. We spoke to doctor Leon Hobbes of the Nebraska Medical Research Symposium and he reported the following:“I have never seen anything like it … One sting causes nearly immediate necrosis of surrounding tissue. The venom then quickly spreads causing the destruction of organs. Most victims succumb to renal failure often within hours. Some have had such intense allergic reactions that the complications were enough to cause death within a matter of minutes …” The Asian Giant Hornet is the largest species of Hornet in the world with some queens reaching more than 5cm in length. They are found throughout Eastern Asia, particularly in Japan where they are commonlyknown as the Giant Sparrow Bee.This Wasp species is larger than any other with average Asian Giant Hornets growing to between 2.7cm and 4.5cm in length, with a wingspan of around 7cm. The queens can grow to 5.5cm but are similar in appearance to the worker Hornets with an orange head, black mandibles and a black and golden body. The Asian Giant Hornet has two sets of eyes, one compound and one ocelli, both of which are brown in colour along with their legs. Unlike other species of Wasp, and indeed Bees, the stinger of the Asian Giant Hornet is not barbed and therefore remains attached to its body once used. This means that Asian Giant Hornets are able to sting their victims repeatedly, injecting a complex venom that is known to contain eight different chemicals. Hornets have killed dozens of people in China and injured more than 1,500 with their powerful venomous sting.The Asian giant hornet, known scientifically as Vespa mandarinia, carries a venom that destroys red blood cells, which can result in kidney failure and death, said Justin O. Schmidt, an entomologist at the Southwest Biological Institute in Tucson, Arizona.But perhaps a bigger problem than the toxicity of the venom is allergy, Schmidt says. Some people are naturally more allergic to stinging insects than others; a sting can trigger a deadly anaphylactic reaction, which may involve airway closure or cardiac arrest.Since July, hornet attacks have killed 42 people and injured 1,675 people in three cities in Shaanxi province, according to the local government. Among those attacked, 206 are receiving treatment in hospitals.

200	Students at New York University, where a year of undergraduate education can run to about $66, 000 in room, board, tuition and fees, often complain about the cost of four years at the school in Greenwich Village. Now, N. Y. U. has a suggestion for them: Finish faster. On Friday, the university announced a series of measures that make it easier to graduate in under four years, part of an initiative aimed at diminishing the university’s enormous affordability problem. In some ways, the school is just catching up with its students. Ellen Schall, a senior presidential fellow and the head of the university’s affordability steering committee, which is tackling college cost on a number of fronts, said that about 20 percent of N. Y. U. students already graduated ahead of schedule. “We were surprised,” Professor Schall said. “That’s part of what convinced us we needed to make this more transparent and more available to more students. ” Students have long found ways to make it through school more quickly to save money. But there is increasing momentum to formalize the process in the face of ballooning outrage over college costs and student debt  —   while N. Y. U. is expensive, many other private universities cost $60, 000 or more a year. Gov. John Kasich, Republican of Ohio, pushed to make it easier for students in his state to graduate from public colleges early by allowing more credits from high school or technical programs. Gov. Scott Walker, Republican of Wisconsin, included in his budget proposal this month that schools in the University of Wisconsin system should create a   degree for 60 percent of its programs by the summer of 2020. Purdue University in West Lafayette, Ind. which is a state school, has also been experimenting with   degree options. Among elite private institutions, official programs remain rare, though Wesleyan University, the Connecticut liberal arts school, announced a formalized   track about five years ago. N. Y. U. ’s “acceleration” effort relies on a few shifts. For example, while students pay for 18 credits per semester, many actually take only 16, officials said, so the university will increase the number of   courses it offers. It will also allow many students to transfer in up to eight credits from other schools, like local community colleges where they can take inexpensive classes over the summer  —   in the past, this has been allowed on a    basis. In addition, the university has trained advisers to help students create schedules that will get them to their   goal. But some who study education wonder what students will miss if they rush through their undergraduate years, and they worry about who will feel pressure to make those sacrifices. Sara   a professor of higher education policy at Temple University, said that shaving time off college as a way to make it more affordable could raise some troubling questions. In college, she said, there is academic learning, but there are also important experiences outside the classroom, like the social networks students build, study abroad programs and internships  —   assuming students do not have to hold down jobs that crowd out those things in the first place. While some students can get what they need academically in three years, Dr.   said, packing in all those credits can take away from the time they can spend on other things. “We agree that the price of college is a problem,” she said. But she questioned whether the solution was “to essentially have less college, or less time in college. ” “It’s interesting,” she said of accelerated schedules, “but it worries me. ” Michael S. Roth, the Wesleyan president disputed the idea that there was something uniquely effective about an   undergraduate education. “I don’t think there’s anything magical about eight semesters, or six, or 10, for example,” he said. “ I think it’s just a convention. ” The   tracks are not always popular, however. Mr Roth estimated that about 20 Wesleyan students annually graduate in three years, up from roughly three a year before they made the option official. As of this May, Purdue expects 14 students to have graduated in three and a half years or less, since the program was announced in 2014. “So far, we haven’t had a lot of takers,” said Josh Boyd, director of undergraduate studies in the Brian Lamb School of Communication at Purdue. “When we speak to parents, they tend to be more excited about it than the students. ” Indeed, many American students take six years to graduate from college. Ashley   an N. Y. U. English major who is on track to graduate this May after just three years, said that she did not regret speeding through. While she had to skip some fun classes, like   dance, she has had time for plenty of experiences. She interned at the International Rescue Committee, she has worked as an office assistant and an executive assistant, and she studied abroad in Madrid. Ms.   said she decided to hustle through to save money. She expected to receive less financial aid her senior year because her mother planned to go back to work. But this track is not for everyone, she said. Ms.   who describes herself as a planner, said she knew she wanted to be an English major when she was a junior in high school. Students who need time to to figure that out, as most do, would be better served taking their time, she said. “I definitely think this is a way to ease the burden for now, but I don’t think it’s a   solution” to the cost of college, Ms.   said. “It doesn’t take into account every type of student, and every type of student should have the ability to make college affordable to themselves. ” Professor Schall agreed that this solution was not for everyone, nor did it suffice on its own. The affordability committee, which was convened by N. Y. U. ’s president, Andrew Hamilton, is experimenting with a variety of ways to cut down on costs and give students a financial lift. There are   items  —   Facebook can alert students if there is food left over after staff meetings  —   and those that are much larger. The university froze the cost of room and board this school year for the first time in decades. Tuition increased this year, but Professor Schall said it was the lowest percentage increase in 20 years. Couldn’t N. Y. U. and other colleges solve the problem just by cutting how much they charge? Professor Schall said there was a constant pressure on universities to increase their capacity to teach and do research, “and those things are expensive. ” “There is no silver bullet,” she continued. “If we could triple our endowment, that would be lovely, but short of that, we’re looking at everything from the price of books to the use of temporary employees,” she said. “We’re trying to be as creative as we can. ”	1
87	Gerard Baker, the editor in chief of The Wall Street Journal, vigorously defended his newspaper’s coverage of President Trump on Monday, rejecting suggestions that The Journal had not been aggressive enough. Facing tough questioning at a    meeting with the staff, Mr. Baker denied that The Journal had been too soft in its coverage, according to several people who participated in the meeting. He suggested that other papers had discarded objectivity, and that anyone who wanted to work at an organization with a more oppositional stance toward the administration could find a job elsewhere, these people said. “It’s a little irritating when I read that we have been soft on Donald Trump,” he said, according to three of the people. During the meeting, which lasted more than an hour and a half, Mr. Baker addressed the unease among some in the newsroom who feared that the paper was holding them back from aggressively covering Mr. Trump  —   and that he might be playing a role in shaping more favorable coverage. Mr. Baker offered a different interpretation, according to two participants in the session: The administration wants to engage the news media in a battle, he said, and The Journal should not become part of it. “We can’t allow ourselves to be dragged into the political process, to be a protagonist in the political fight,” he said, according to one of the people. He said that Americans already distrusted the news media, and that if The Journal covered Mr. Trump in an overly confrontational way, that distrust might increase. He joked that any stories suggesting The Journal had been soft in its coverage of Mr. Trump were akin to “fake news. ” The meeting came after months of uncertainty and frustration in the newsroom. The Journal has begun a sweeping newsroom strategy review, called WSJ2020, that the management recently indicated would result in about $100 million in cost savings. Buyouts and layoffs have roiled the staff. A significant overhaul of the print newspaper resulted in the elimination of some sections, including Greater New York, and the consolidation of others. And though employees recently ratified a new union contract with Dow Jones, the publisher of The Journal, there is worry that there could soon be another tense standoff. Morale sank lower last week when Mr. Baker said that Rebecca Blumenstein, a deputy editor in chief who had been at The Journal for 22 years, was leaving for The New York Times, where she will become one of the paper’s   editors. The announcement surprised and saddened many in the newsroom, where Ms. Blumenstein had been viewed as a potential successor to Mr. Baker. At Monday’s meeting, Mr. Baker answered questions about The Journal’s strategy going forward and acknowledged that the paper had to address concerns about diversity and offer more opportunities for women in the newsroom. But the issue of covering Mr. Trump was front and center, after an episode two weeks ago when Mr. Baker sent a note instructing editors to avoid the phrase “seven majority Muslim countries” when writing about Mr. Trump’s executive order on immigration. “It’s very loaded,” Mr. Baker wrote at the time. “The reason they’ve been chosen is not because they’re majority Muslim but because they’re on the list of countries Obama identified as countries of concern. ” Mr. Baker later sent a note to employees clarifying that there was “no ban on the phrase ‘  country’” but that the publication should “always be careful that this term is not offered as the only description of the countries covered under the ban. ” The discontent among a faction of journalists over coverage of Mr. Trump stretches back months, according to current and former employees. There was unease in the newsroom after Mr. Baker wrote a column in The Spectator, a conservative British magazine, about Mr. Trump’s victory. During the meeting on Monday, Mr. Baker, in answer to a question about the column, admitted that he probably should have resisted the temptation to write it, according to some of the people who participated. The Journal’s coverage has also drawn criticism from outside. In late November, after Mr. Trump falsely claimed on Twitter that “millions of people” had voted illegally, the paper was derided online for printing a   headline that parroted Mr. Trump’s assertion without pointing out that it was inaccurate. In a statement at the time, a spokeswoman for The Journal said, “We evaluate all statements by   Trump for their news value and then subject them to the tough, thorough and impartial reporting we bring to all issues we report upon. ” Disturbed by the paper’s coverage, a number of journalists at The Journal began communicating by email about their concerns. The internal email chain, a portion of which was obtained by The Times, included general concerns about how articles on the new administration were being framed and objections to certain wording choices.

649	 There’s widespread and growing lack of confidence in the safety of vaccines …Know anyone who still believes that vaccines can’t cause autism?Take a look at the DTaP vaccine insert: In the German case-control study and US open-label safety study in which 14,971 infants received Tripedia vaccine, 13 deaths in Tripedia vaccine recipients were reported. Causes of deaths included seven SIDS, and one of each of the following: enteritis, Leigh Syndrome, adrenogenital syndrome, cardiac arrest, motor vehicle accident, and accidental drowning. All of these events occurred more than two weeks post immunization. The rate of SIDS observed in the German case-control study was 0.4/1,000 vaccinated infants. The rate of SIDS observed in the US open-label safety study was 0.8/1,000 vaccinated infants and the reported rate of SIDS in the US from 1985-1991 was 1.5/1,000 live births. By chance alone, some cases of SIDS can be expected to follow receipt of whole-cell pertussis DTP35 or DTaP vaccines. The ADVERSE REACTIONS section must list adverse reactions identified from domestic and foreign spontaneous reports. This listing must be separate from the listing of adverse reactions identified in clinical trials and must also be preceded by information necessary to interpret the adverse reactions. To help practitioners interpret the significance of data obtained from postmarketing spontaneous reports, the following statement, or an appropriate modification, should precede these data:Contains Nonbinding Recommendations 8 The following adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of drug X. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. A prominent British medical journal retracted a 1998 research paper that set off a sharp decline in vaccinations in Britain after the paper’s lead author suggested that vaccines could cause autism.The retraction by The Lancet is part of a reassessment that has lasted for years of the scientific methods and financial conflicts of Dr. Andrew Wakefield, who contended that his research showed that the combined measles, mumps and rubella vaccine may be unsafe.Tom Skinner, a spokesman for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, called the retraction of Dr. Wakefield’s study “significant.”“It builds on the overwhelming body of research by the world’s leading scientists that concludes there is no link between M.M.R. vaccine and autism,” Mr. Skinner wrote.A British medical panel concluded that Dr. Wakefield had been dishonest, violated basic research ethics rules and showed a “callous disregard” for the suffering of children involved in his research.Dr. Wakefield’s paper reported on his examinations of 12 children with chronic intestinal disorders who had a history of normal development followed by severe mental regressions. But an investigation by a British journalist found financial and scientific conflicts that Dr. Wakefield did not reveal in his paper. For instance, part of the costs of Dr. Wakefield’s research were paid by lawyers for parents seeking to sue vaccine makers for damages. Dr. Wakefield was also found to have patented in 1997 a measles vaccine that would succeed if the combined vaccine were withdrawn or discredited. An academic journal is not a collection of blank pages on to which authors inscribe important scientific facts as they discover them. Rather, science is made and shaped as authors consider the declared areas of interest, impact factors, and instructions for authors of candidate journals for their work and as the papers they submit clear the successive hurdles of eligibility screening, selection of peer reviewers, responding to reviewers’ comments, statistical approval, technical editing, and distribution of press releases. A graph showing first a precipitous fall in immunisation rates in the United Kingdom and then a corresponding rise in the incidence of measles was later reproduced in the broadsheets (and in at least one GCSE biology syllabus) as an iconic symbol of bad science. Once the article appeared with the Lancet kitemark — cautious accompanying editorial notwithstanding — the arguments were considered by many to be proved, and the ghastly social drama of the demon vaccine took on a life of its own. In 1998, Andrew Wakefield and 12 of his colleagues published a case series in the Lancet, which suggested that the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine may predispose to behavioral regression and pervasive developmental disorder in children. Despite the small sample size (n=12), the uncontrolled design, and the speculative nature of the conclusions, the paper received wide publicity, and MMR vaccination rates began to drop because parents were concerned about the risk of autism after vaccination.Almost immediately afterward, epidemiological studies were conducted and published, refuting the posited link between MMR vaccination and autism. The logic that the MMR vaccine may trigger autism was also questioned because a temporal link between the two is almost predestined: both events, by design (MMR vaccine) or definition (autism), occur in early childhood.The next episode in the saga was a short retraction of the interpretation of the original data by 10 of the 12 co-authors of the paper. According to the retraction, “no causal link was established between MMR vaccine and autism as the data were insufficient”. This was accompanied by an admission by the Lancet that Wakefield et al. had failed to disclose financial interests (e.g., Wakefield had been funded by lawyers who had been engaged by parents in lawsuits against vaccine-producing companies). However, the Lancet exonerated Wakefield and his colleagues from charges of ethical violations and scientific misconduct.The Lancet completely retracted the Wakefield et al. paper in February 2010, admitting that several elements in the paper were incorrect, contrary to the findings of the earlier investigation. Wakefield et al. were held guilty of ethical violations (they had conducted invasive investigations on the children without obtaining the necessary ethical clearances) and scientific misrepresentation (they reported that their sampling was consecutive when, in fact, it was selective). This retraction was published as a small, anonymous paragraph in the journal, on behalf of the editors.The final episode in the saga is the revelation that Wakefield et al. were guilty of deliberate fraud (they picked and chose data that suited their case; they falsified facts). The British Medical Journal has published a series of articles on the exposure of the fraud, which appears to have taken place for financial gain. It is a matter of concern that the exposé was a result of journalistic investigation, rather than academic vigilance followed by the institution of corrective measures. Readers may be interested to learn that the journalist on the Wakefield case, Brian Deer, had earlier reported on the false implication of thiomersal (in vaccines) in the etiology of autism. However, Deer had not played an investigative role in that report.	0
467	How do New York Times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives? The Times’s fashion director and critic discusses the tech she uses. As a fashion critic, what’s your favorite tech product that helps you spot and keep track of fashion trends? My iPhone 5, embarrassing as that is to say, and my laptop. I am stuck with my iPhone 5 because I have a keyboard attachment for it that turns it into a BlackBerry, and which I love because during fashion shows I file reviews on my phone and they can be 1, 000 words long. I can’t do that on a touch screen. I hate lugging anything bigger than the phone around since I carry so much else. I also use the gadgets mostly to surf around Instagram and Facebook and various news sites to see what regular people are wearing during their everyday lives in places I am not. For runway trends, I just use my eyes. You’ve written a lot about wearable technology. Are smartwatches ever going to be fashionable enough to replace normal watches? I am sure they will be at some point, but who knows when that will be. The problem is they just look too much like gadgets  —   or like wannabe traditional watches. Someone has to come up with a third paradigm. Then whoever does that will be in clover. Beyond your job, what tech product are you currently obsessed with using in your daily life? My Kindle. It’s really the only other tech product I use. I have gone through iPad and tablet phases, and smartwatch moments, but they all end up in the back of a drawer somewhere or my kids take them. I am really interested in tech that is efficient and functional and solves problems that are real problems, not theoretical ones. After that, I find it hard to get worked up. What do you and your family do with it? Read! Plus a Kindle is very good to take to shows, because I am lugging a heavy bag full of stuff all day, and it is light and takes up almost no room. And it gives me something to occupy my mind during the endless minutes I spend waiting for shows to start. What could be better about it? The light. Shows have very complicated lighting plans and sometimes that makes it hard to read. What is your children’s favorite piece of technology and why? The favorite app for my    and    daughters are Snapchat and SoundCloud. That’s because they can use Snapchat to connect with their friends and stay in touch with those that are far away, and SoundCloud because it is easy and a good way to find new music and fun remixes. For my    son: Spotify, because he loves listening to music. Favorite piece of technology (from all of them): their iPhones. It is like another limb for them.	1

416	After Sunday night’s     when the presenters Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway announced the wrong best picture, we asked the chief film critics of The New York Times, A. O. Scott and Manohla Dargis, and the Times critic at large, Wesley Morris, to share their reactions. A. O. SCOTT Wow, that “Bonnie and Clyde” sequel was totally nuts. But in its own way, last night’s spectacle  —   so relatively smooth, until all of a sudden it was anything but  —   represents a Hollywood watershed or, at least, like the original “Bonnie and Clyde,” the arrival of a new generation. The envelope   was painful, but it brought to the stage two directors in their 30s with five features between them and reminded the audience that Damien Chazelle and Barry Jenkins are not enemies. The grace with which the “La La Land” producers (Jordan Horowitz, in particular) handled the handoff  —   and the poise with which Mr. Jenkins and his producer, Adele Romanski, received the belated honor for “Moonlight”  —   should quell the facile polarization that followed the two movies throughout the awards season. And the messiness of the finale makes vivid what turned out to be the theme and the true political message of the night, which was inclusiveness. The   speeches were pointed at times but also muted, with the president’s name mostly unmentioned, and his policies opposed with     appeals. What held it all together was the idea that in Hollywood there is room for everyone. Even Mel Gibson! The two “Hacksaw Ridge” wins strike me as a reminder of the ideological diversity that has always existed in this bastion of liberalism. And the evening, at its best, was both a demonstration of, and an argument for, the value of pluralism, for expansive humanism as an antidote to narrowness and intolerance. MANOHLA DARGIS Most of the evening was weird and bad. (The stunt with the tourists was a   moment of Marie Antoinette obtuseness  —   ah, look, little people!) Then it turned weird and glorious. I shrieked when Mr. Horowitz announced that “Moonlight” had won (did you hear me?) but my heart also went out to the “La La Land” team. No matter how much I wanted “Moonlight” to win, I wouldn’t wish that kind of public spectacle on anyone, especially a group as pleasant as that behind “La La Land. ” Some on Twitter mocked the “La La Landers” for having tears in their eyes, so it’s lovely that the filmmakers from both movies were so much more gracious. Jimmy Kimmel could pick up some tips on manners and crisis management from Mr. Horowitz. More to the point, it would be great if the academy finally solved its host problem. Among other things, it would be nice if it found a host who both was actually interested in the art and didn’t mock the movies. (Make fun of the stars in the room  —   that’s what they’re there for.) At the very least, you would think the academy, which has made real if confusing strides toward inclusion, would understand that its   efforts seem a little hollow when a straight, white male host jokes about no one’s seeing a movie from a black director about gay black men. Optics, people, optics! As for Mr. Gibson, well, as the resident kooky conservative, he came off as a kind of proxy for President Trump. WESLEY MORRIS Just to reiterate: THAT HAPPENED, an event that  —   wait, “event” is too mild. A fiasco? Nightmare? Accidental slip of the entertainment psyche? Act of justice? Honestly, I don’t know. But something happened that seemed to simultaneously tell us who we were, are, believe ourselves to be. This is, what, the fourth time since November that the country has gathered for an evening of live television, only to be part of a   ceremony. After Sunday night, the presidential election, the Super Bowl and, to a different but related extent, the Grammys, I’ve officially come down with     stress disorder  —   Ooptsd, as in upside my head. What went down between the makers of “Moonlight” and “La La Land” was stunning and strange yet perversely, cosmically right for a night that began with Justin Timberlake’s telling Denzel Washington that surely he recognized the Bill Withers cover Mr. Timberlake was oozing his way through. That moment felt like a distillation of the politics surrounding Mr. Chazelle’s movie. That moment felt like the history of American entertainment distilled into an aside that I don’t even really blame Mr. Timberlake for. If we’ve learned nothing in the past 18 months, if not eight years, it’s that history is bigger than all of us and is always going to rat us out, forcing us to conform to its grip. But I’m with you guys about what gentlemen Mr. Jenkins and Mr. Horowitz were under the most bizarre of circumstances. That errant envelope deprived a proper reckoning of Mr. Jenkins’s achievement  —   and, of course  —   the academy’s. So let’s talk about that. “Moonlight” won best picture. That happened. Hollywood tried to wrest itself from history’s grip. And despite the bizarreness, that feels extraordinary, too. SCOTT “Moonlight” won best picture. That is an outcome I must say I never allowed myself to contemplate, even though I fell for the movie early and hard. I didn’t think it needed the award as proof of its merit  —   no piece of art ever really needs a prize in that way  —   and, in any case, I figured the academy would give it the standard   treatment: a screenwriting and supporting actor prize with the expectation of gratitude for just being included in the festivities. Which was exactly what seemed to be happening. And then (to echo Wesley) something else happened. We’re all still puzzling over what exactly it was. As Mr. Jenkins said: “But to hell with dreams. I’m done with it, because this is true. ” However awkwardly and backwardly the truth was revealed, “Moonlight” won best picture. That fact is something to hold onto, whether it portends a new direction or turns out to be an outlier. Unpredictability, in any case, seems to be the new normal. Some of our most beloved institutions  —   or maybe let’s just say our most begrudgingly tolerated, our most    as a matter of professional obligation  —   no longer function according to established rules and patterns. Or else they do (bad jokes, cheesy musical numbers, careful political statements, predictable winners) until all of a sudden they don’t. That kind of disruption can be upsetting, even horrifying. Last night showed that it can also be beautiful. “Moonlight” won best picture. I will never get tired of saying that. DARGIS But that’s the Oscars, isn’t it? They’re terrible and totally meaningless until the academy picks a movie we love. (Hello, “The Hurt Locker”!) Still, while the academy did give “Moonlight” best picture, the fact that Mr. Chazelle won best director suggests that last night was a squeaker. It may be that the academy’s push to diversify itself by adding new members has paid off, but some of the ugliness that aired during the interminable slog up to Sunday night indicates that the academy remains deeply divided. (Sound familiar?) Some of this was the usual campaign nonsense, but more than one white person also suggested that I love “Moonlight” only because it’s a black film. So, yes, the academy got it right, and “Moonlight” is now the first best picture winner to have been directed by an  . To turn back to that other milestone movie: When Kathryn Bigelow won best director for “The Hurt Locker” in 2010, some hoped that her historic win would serve as a breakthrough for women, but it hasn’t, and the numbers for female filmmakers are worse now. I don’t want to harsh our mellow, but I also don’t want to overpraise the academy for occasionally getting it right when the industry continues to get it so wrong. “Moonlight,” after all, wasn’t made by one of the big studios, which are more interested in superhero fantasies it was bankrolled by A24, a small, independent company. MORRIS There’s also that. While this was an important night for nonwhite and   filmmakers and actors, American movies continue to be appallingly bad for female filmmakers. Meanwhile, the major studios are out to lunch  —   or at the bank. A24 has the most exciting taste of any American studio,   or  . That “Moonlight” won doesn’t excuse anything. What happens the next year, or the year after, when it’s #OscarSoWhiteAgain? Over and over on Sunday, writers and actors and producers made statements about the urgency for more vivid representation, that we in the audience hunger for it, whether we live in Liberty City (the Miami neighborhood where “Moonlight” is set) or Manchester by the Sea. The three of us spend a few weeks talking about the Academy Awards and the rest of the year out in the marketplace, just watching movies. The real dream would be to arrive at a place where we can watch a film and argue about who’s in it instead of who isn’t. And can I also say, Manohla, that I really liked that moment with the tour group? If they’d been bused in against their will for our entertainment, I’d object. But those sights are, presumably, a version of what they paid that tour company to show them: the world through Jennifer Aniston’s sunglasses. When Mr. Kimmel asked that one woman, a    who her favorite star was, and she pointed to Mr. Washington, my heart melted. We’ve been talking about optics and history, and it felt meaningful to me that the bride, her groom and their complementary   personalities got to meet her favorite movie actor and that, in some way, Mr. Washington got to meet  —   and “marry”  —   them. For what it’s worth, he was nominated this year for playing an average guy. Sure, that tourist stunt culminated in three black people having a moment around a smartphone. But it was also a fantastical snapshot of a   ideal: weird, wedded bliss.	1

224	Omar Abdel Rahman, the blind Islamic cleric whose fulminating sermons inspired violent fundamentalist movements in Egypt and, an American court found, a 1993 plot for a bombing rampage in New York, died on Saturday at a federal prison near Raleigh, N. C. where he was serving a life sentence. He was 78. Greg Norton, a spokesman for the prison, the Butner Federal Correctional Complex, confirmed the death, saying the cause was complications of diabetes and coronary artery disease. Born to a humble merchant in a Nile Delta village and blind from infancy, Mr. Abdel Rahman became one of the most influential and fearsome theologians of the Islamist fundamentalism that swept the Middle East in recent decades. On Oct. 1, 1995, Mr. Abdel Rahman was convicted, along with nine other defendants, on sedition charges in Federal District Court in Manhattan. He was found guilty of guiding a conspiracy to wage “a war of urban terrorism,” with the ultimate aim of carrying out a day of bombings against the Holland and Lincoln Tunnels, the George Washington Bridge, the United Nations and the Manhattan headquarters of the F. B. I. Those bombings never happened, but the intent of the conspiracy, prosecutors said, was to destroy New York landmarks, kill hundreds of people and force the United States to abandon its support for Israel and Egypt. Prosecutors also asserted that Mr. Rahman was linked to the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center, which killed six people. In Mr. Abdel Rahman’s trial, prosecutors described the World Trade Center attack as part of a broader conspiracy involving the blind cleric. They depicted the bombing as part of a plot that included the killing of a militant rabbi in 1990 and the conspiracy to blow up New York landmarks. Before coming to the United States, Mr. Abdel Rahman was put on trial in Egypt. In 1980, according to courtroom testimony there, he gave a blessing to a cell of militant Islamists, emboldening them to assassinate President Anwar   during a military parade on Oct. 6, 1981, in Cairo. Mr. Abdel Rahman faced trial twice in Egypt for instigating Mr. Sadat’s assassination and for political disturbances that erupted at the time. Twice, in 1982 and 1984, he was acquitted. In learned but vitriolic jeremiads, Mr. Abdel Rahman denounced Egypt’s secularist leaders as corrupt pharaohs and infidels. He proclaimed that faithful Muslims had a duty to wage jihad, or holy war, to install a government in Egypt that would obey the strictest Islamic laws. He denounced what he saw as the corrosive effect on Islam of the materialistic and hypersexualized West. In 1990, as he fled from Egypt, Mr. Abdel Rahman moved to the United States, bringing his   preaching and his campaign against the Egyptian president, Hosni Mubarak, to mosques in Brooklyn and Jersey City. Mr. Abdel Rahman, who was known as the blind sheikh, spent years in the most severe solitary confinement, barred from communicating with his followers, praying with other prisoners or even listening to Arabic radio. Failing blood circulation had killed the sensation in his fingertips, making it impossible for him to read his Braille Islamic texts. Mr. Abdel Rahman was born on May 3, 1938, in a small village in the Nile Delta. An infection blinded him at 10 months. When he became an adult, his right eye remained open but clouded while his left eye stayed closed. Sent to a school for the blind, he excelled, learning Braille and memorizing the Quran by the time he was 11. He trained to be an Islamic scholar, completing his doctoral degree in 1973 at   University in Cairo, the world’s premier center of Islamic learning. Mr. Abdel Rahman first antagonized the Egyptian authorities in 1970 when he barred the faithful in a mosque where he was presiding, in the town Fayoum, from praying after the death of President Gamal Abdel Nasser, a secularist. He was imprisoned for several months. Soon he began to espouse a doctrine, rooted in   Quranic interpretation, holding that devout Muslims were obliged to kill rulers who did not follow Islamic law. Saad Hasaballah, a lawyer who represented Mr. Abdel Rahman in the Sadat assassination trials, said the sheikh told the Islamist army officers involved in the plot that a secular leader like Mr. Sadat deserved death  —   although he never mentioned the president by name. In 1984, Egypt’s highest court found that Mr. Abdel Rahman had been tortured while in prison during the trials. Years later, at a news conference in New Jersey, he enumerated 12 methods of torture he said jailers had used. During the 1980s, Mr. Abdel Rahman emerged as the imam of the Islamic Group, a student organization that grew to include thousands of members. Over more than a decade, the group carried out terrorist attacks, including many on tourist sites, killing foreigners and paralyzing Egypt’s tourism industry. The government responded fiercely, imprisoning thousands of the group’s followers. Mr. Abdel Rahman also traveled that decade to Afghanistan and Pakistan, giving religious teachings to the Islamist fighters battling the Soviet occupation. He brought two of his sons, Ahmed and Muhammad, still teenagers, to Afghanistan to join the jihad. His preaching there brought him in contact with Osama bin Laden. In 1989, Mr. Abdel Rahman was put on trial again in Egypt, charged with instigating an antigovernment riot in Fayoum. Placed under house arrest, he managed to escape. On July 18, 1990, he traveled to New York, carrying a visa granted by the United States consulate in Sudan. Since his name had appeared on a State Department terrorism watch list, the visa prompted outrage in Congress and an investigation of the immigration agency. Still, Mr. Abdel Rahman did little to mute his sermons when he took up preaching in Brooklyn and Jersey City. After several of the bomb plot suspects were arrested in the act of mixing a brew of explosives, Mr. Abdel Rahman surrendered to federal authorities on July 2, 1993. His trial hinged on transcripts of secretly recorded meetings with an F. B. I. informant, Emad Salem. He was represented by the civil rights lawyer Lynne Stewart, who was convicted in 2004 of smuggling messages from the imprisoned sheikh to his followers in Egypt. She was granted compassionate release from federal prison three years ago after being found to have breast cancer. In court, Mr. Abdel Rahman maintained his innocence. At his January 1996 sentencing, he called the trial “an attack on the words of God” and said the United States, “an enemy of Islam,” was seeking to give him “a slow death. ”	1

257	LONDON  —   With thousands of people demonstrating against President Trump outside Parliament, British lawmakers on Monday debated whether to deny him a formal state visit because  —   in the eyes of nearly two million Britons in an online petition  —   it would “cause embarrassment to Her Majesty the queen. ” The debate included the kind of political showmanship and heated language that members of Parliament often do well, with dueling lawmakers invoking Mr. Trump’s impetuousness, his strategic importance to Britain or even his willingness to misrepresent the weather during his inauguration as reasons to cancel or go ahead with the visit. “The intellectual capacity of the president is protozoan,” said Paul Flynn, an opposition Labour lawmaker who led the argument against a state visit. In making his case, Mr. Flynn quoted a journalist’s remarks about the disgrace of “pimping out the queen for Donald Trump”  —   a remark that the Conservative legislator Jacob   condemned as unworthy, even as a quotation. Mr. Trump would hardly be the first contentious leader to be honored with a state visit. The queen, acting as always on the recommendation of the government, has in the past received President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe, the Romanian dictator Nicolae Ceausescu and President Mobutu Sese Seko, the former leader of Zaire, now the Democratic Republic of Congo. After a recent visit with President Xi Jinping of China, she was caught on camera speaking of how “very rude” the Chinese leader had been. “A queen who has been asked over the decades to host tyrants such as Presidents Mobutu of Zaire and Ceausescu of Romania is going to take a brash billionaire from New York effortlessly in her stride,” William Hague, a former foreign secretary, wrote in The Daily Telegraph. Still, the prospect of Mr. Trump’s visit has stirred great passion in Britain. The online petition, backed by 1. 8 million people, does not call for Mr. Trump to be barred from Britain altogether, only that his visit be a political one, without the involvement of Queen Elizabeth II. Another online petition, signed by more than 300, 000 people, called for the state visit to take place. Petitions with more than 100, 000 signatures are eligible for parliamentary debate, and any vote would not be binding. The government of Prime Minister Theresa May has been firm in saying that the invitation to Mr. Trump for a full state visit this year will not be withdrawn. In Parliament, Mr. Flynn cited the need to keep public trust in politicians and noted that no president had ever been invited for a state visit in his first year in office. He also accused Mr. Trump of acting “like a petulant child” and said the queen should not be seen as approving either his actions or his attitudes toward women and Muslims. But a Conservative legislator, Nigel Evans, said that Mr. Trump was the president of a great ally of Britain and that the critics should “get over it. ” Mr. Trump was fairly elected, he said, adding, “I do respect that he stood on a platform on which he is now delivering. ” Alex Salmond, a legislator from the Scottish National Party, argued that the invitation should be rescinded because members should not confuse respect for the United States with a personal invitation to Mr. Trump. Traditionally, American presidents must wait several years before getting a state visit, and many do not get one at all. Mrs. May, after Britain’s vote in June to leave the European Union, was eager to cement good relations with the new American president, and she arranged a rapid visit to Washington. During the visit, she conveyed the invitation, which Mr. Trump accepted. Leaving the European Union could lock Britain out of the bloc’s single market, a   zone, as well as the customs union, which eliminates tariffs and customs checks. So Mrs. May has seemed eager to shore up her country’s relations with the United States as a counterbalance. During the debate, a Labour legislator, David Lammy, spoke of Mr. Trump’s attitudes and asked why Britain should “abandon all its principles” and invite him, “because this country is so desperate for a trade deal that we would throw all our own history out the window?” He said: “We didn’t do this for Kennedy. We didn’t do this for Truman. We didn’t do this for Reagan. But for this man, after seven days, we say, ‘Please come and we will lay on everything because we are so desperate for your company? ’” He added, “I am ashamed that it has come to this. ” But James Cartlidge, a Conservative, said that if Britain canceled the visit, “there will be smiles all around in the Kremlin,” which wants to “divide the West. ” And another Conservative, Simon Burns, said that it was important to be “a candid friend” able to influence Mr. Trump and the United States, particularly so given Britain’s plan to leave the European Union. Various opinion polls indicate that a small majority of Britons support the state visit. But there are also concerns that it would be met with large protests, comparable to 2003, when President George W. Bush made a state visit and many came out to protest the Iraq war. The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, supports the petition to disinvite Mr. Trump because of the president’s “ban on people from seven   countries” and his decision to block refugees from entering the United States. “In those circumstances, we shouldn’t be rolling out the red carpet,” Mr. Khan said on Sunday. On Monday, the House of Lords began at least two days of debate on a bill, already passed by the House of Commons, to authorize the government to enact Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, which would inform the European Union of Britain’s intention to leave the bloc. The government intends to invoke Article 50 by the end of March, if not sooner, beginning at least two years of negotiations with the other 27 member states on the terms of Britain’s exit and a framework for future relations.	1
176	ERBIL, Iraq  —   A car bomb exploded in a crowded Shiite Muslim neighborhood in Baghdad late Thursday afternoon, the latest terror attack in the capital claimed by the Islamic State, security officials reported. At least 54 people were killed and at least 63 more wounded in the bombing, making it the deadliest in Baghdad in at least a month. The attack came as Iraqi security forces, backed by American military advisers and Special Operations forces, prepared to assault an Islamic State stronghold in Mosul, Iraq’s   city, about 225 miles north of Baghdad. The country has been consumed by news from Mosul, where Iraqi forces have been mounting the country’s largest military operation since the United States invasion in 2003, driving Islamic State fighters from eastern Mosul over the last month Security officials said the bomb in Baghdad went off in a parked pickup truck. Ambulances responding to the scene quickly filled to capacity, so the police and civilians helped transport other victims to hospitals, according to Abu Jafar, a police commissioner. Mr. Jafar said the morgue at Yarmouk Hospital in Baghdad was overflowing with bodies of the dead, and the hospital’s emergency room was filled to capacity with seriously injured people. The Islamic State militant group, also known as ISIS or ISIL, posted a statement online claiming responsibility for the attack, and said that it was aimed at Shiite Muslims, whom many fundamentalist Sunnis consider to be nonbelievers. Shiites are a majority in Iraq and dominate the national government. Prime Minister Haider   convened an emergency meeting with top military and security officials Thursday night to discuss efforts to combat terrorist attacks. A witness to the bombing, Amir Abas, 35, said he was standing about 150 yards from the pickup truck when it exploded. “I saw a lot of burned bodies, and injured people and burned cars everywhere,” he said. The bombing took place in the Baya neighborhood of southern Baghdad, where there are a number of parking lots in which people gather to buy and sell used cars, attracting large crowds on weekday afternoons. Civilians in Shiite neighborhoods have often been the targets of attacks claimed by the Islamic State. Shiite militias, known as popular mobilization forces, are expected to take part in the military assault in western Mosul and particularly in the neighboring city of Tal Afar to the west. On   television channels in Iraq, news reports from Mosul are shown with a standing logo that says in Arabic and English, “Nineveh, We Are Coming. ” Mosul, the last major city in Iraq where the Islamic State still maintains significant control, is the capital of Nineveh Province. Baghdad has been hit by a series of terrorist attacks recently. At least 11 people were killed Wednesday by a bombing in another   lot at the edge of Sadr City, a large Shiite neighborhood. A suicide bombing in January in Sadr City killed more than 30 people. Hakim   a legislator who heads the security and defense committee in Parliament, criticized intelligence and security officials for failing to anticipate the attack on Thursday. Mr. Zamili has been a frequent critic of the security establishment. “This explosion indicates the weakness of the intelligence network in Baghdad,” he said in a telephone interview on Thursday night. Islamic State terrorists are able to carry out attacks “at any time and anywhere” in the capital, he said.	1
585	 Trump Junior continued, “Like, for instance, I was very good at geography when I was in school. But, they don’t know that. And that’s just another example of how lazy the Hispanics are as a race. And the main reason why they’re so afraid of my dad is he’s going to deport them back to Asia when he wins the election. It’s a well-known fact that fear makes people to crazy things. It’s made them come and try to suck up to me so I’d help them get in my dad’s good graces. Yeah, good luck with that.”“My father is not a stupid man, and I can tell you he didn’t father a stupid son, either,” Eric Trump added. “And when he does deport all these lazy Hispanics back to Asia where they came from, he’ll be doing that for two reasons. The first one is obvious – we don’t need lazy people in this country. The second is that’s part of his plan of taking back American jobs from China. That’s why he’ll send most of the Hispanics back to the Chinese capital of Bangkok, which is where most American jobs are located at the moment.” Newslo is the first hybrid News/Satire platform on the web. Readers come to us for a unique brand of entertainment and information that is enhanced by features like our fact-button, which allows readers to find what is fact and what is satire. People often talk about Hispanics,” Eric Trump said earlier this week on Irish radio’s RTE Radio1’s “Drivetime.”“You know, I have more Hispanics come up to me telling me, ‘Listen, I can’t wait for your father to be president. He’s going to bring jobs back to the United States. He’s going to end the nonsense. He’s going to create good trade deals. He’s going to create better education. He’s going to create a better family structure.’”	0
211	MELBOURNE, Fla.  —   During President Trump’s transition to power, his team reached out to Elliott Abrams for help building a new administration. Mr. Abrams, a seasoned Republican foreign policy official, sent lists of possible candidates for national security jobs. One by one, the answer from the Trump team came back no. The reason was consistent: This one had said disparaging things about Mr. Trump during the campaign that one had signed a letter opposing him. Finally, the White House asked Mr. Abrams himself to meet with the president about becoming deputy secretary of state, only to have the same thing happen  —   vetoed because of past criticism. Mr. Abrams’s experience has become a case study in the challenges Mr. Trump still faces in filling top positions a month into his presidency. Mr. Trump remains fixated on the campaign as he applies a loyalty test to some prospective officials. For their part, many Republicans reacted to what happened to Mr. Abrams with dismay, leaving them increasingly leery about joining an administration that cannot get past the past. As Mr. Trump brings candidates for national security adviser to meet with him in Florida this weekend, he presides over a government where the upper echelons remain sparsely populated. Six of the 15 statutory cabinet secretaries are still awaiting Senate confirmation as Democrats nearly uniformly oppose almost all of the president’s choices. Even some of the cabinet secretaries who are in place may feel they are home alone. It is not just Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson who has no deputy secretary, much less   under secretaries or assistant secretaries. Neither do the heads of the Treasury Department, the Education Department or any of the other cabinet departments. Only three of 15 nominees have been named for deputy secretary positions. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis has a deputy only because he kept the one left over from President Barack Obama’s administration. That does not even begin to cover the rest of the more than 4, 000 appointments that a president typically makes. In some cases, the Trump administration is even going in reverse. A senior political appointee at the housing department, who had already started the job, was fired this past week and marched out of the building when someone discovered his previous statements critical of Mr. Trump. The president’s top Latin America official at the National Security Council was likewise fired after just weeks on the job for complaining about internal dysfunction at an    discussion at a Washington research organization, according to officials, who confirmed a Politico report. The State Department has laid off six top career officials in recent days, apparently out of questions about their loyalty to Mr. Trump. “Many tough things were said about him and by him” before last year’s election, Mr. Abrams, who served as President Ronald Reagan’s assistant secretary of state and President George W. Bush’s deputy national security adviser, said in an interview. “I would have hoped he would have turned toward just hiring the most effective people to help him govern rather than looking back to what we said in that race. ” Mr. Trump has fallen behind the pace of his last three predecessors both in naming senior officials who require Senate confirmation and in securing their confirmations, according to data compiled by the nonpartisan Partnership for Public Service. Whereas Mr. Obama had nominated 40 senior officials by Feb. 11, 2009, Mr. Trump had named 34 of them as of Friday. Mr. Obama had 24 confirmed at that point, while Mr. Trump has 14. The trouble assembling an administration reflects the deeper rift between Mr. Trump and the Washington establishment of both parties. A   businessman with no government experience, Mr. Trump catapulted to power on a promise to break up the existing system. Even after he won the Republican nomination last year, he did little to win over those who had opposed him, while his “never Trump” critics within the party kept up a steady assault on his qualifications and temperament. Mr. Trump faces other hurdles, too. With no cadre ready to go from past political service, he has been starting from scratch. His team has been slow to vet candidates, and in some cases his choices have had troubles with their business backgrounds or other matters. And Democrats have mounted a wall of resistance to his nominations, slowing the process down. The White House did not respond to requests for comment, but Mr. Trump has disputed reports of troubles. “The White House is running so smoothly, so smoothly,” he told a rally of supporters in Melbourne, Fla. on Saturday. “And believe me, we inherited one big mess, that I can tell you. ” The ill will between Mr. Trump and much of the Republican establishment works both ways. Many Republicans who might have agreed to work for the president have been turned off by what they consider his sometimes erratic behavior and the competing power centers inside his White House. After firing his first national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn, Mr. Trump found that his initial choice for a replacement, Robert S. Harward, a retired vice admiral, would not take the job. “The problem is that with each successive episode, it raises the stakes for the next one,” said Peter D. Feaver, a Duke University professor who was a strategic planning adviser to Mr. Bush. “It’s going to be hard for the next outsider to accept the national security job and not request the ability to make personnel changes. ” Richard N. Haass, a former Republican official and now president of the Council on Foreign Relations, said Mr. Trump had “ruled out much of an entire generation of Republican public policy types” and alarmed others with his empowerment of Stephen K. Bannon, his chief strategist, to shape national security. Even some cabinet secretaries appear unable to pick their own staff. “This is unprecedented, it’s untraditional, it’s outside the mainstream,” said Mr. Haass, whose own name had been floated for a position. “And so it’s just that you’d be signing on for, at a minimum, tremendous uncertainty, and quite possibly for being associated with a set of policies you deeply disagree with. ” Stuart Holliday, an ambassador under Mr. Bush, said many Republicans would want to work for Mr. Tillerson or Mr. Mattis. “However, the Republican foreign policy bench is not that deep at senior levels,” he said, “especially if you factor in people who took themselves off the field. ” Former Senator Judd Gregg, Republican of New Hampshire, said the business veterans that Mr. Trump had enlisted for his cabinet were “the most positive thing about his administration so far. ” But he added that the president’s disregard for advice could complicate his efforts to fill posts. “You get the feeling that he’s still flying by his own experiences,” he said, “and that’s got to concern anyone who cares about these issues. ” For Mr. Trump, the challenge is more pronounced because he and his advisers feel they cannot trust some of the senior career professionals still working at the White House or cabinet departments. Leaks about Mr. Flynn and Mr. Trump’s phone calls with foreign leaders have convinced White House officials that they face an opposition within. “You have a new administration that also has fewer people familiar with the processes and systems of government, including the importance of the vetting process,” said Max Stier, the chief executive of the Center for Presidential Transition at the Partnership for Public Service. “You can’t operate as they did in the campaign context, with a smaller than usual group  —   it doesn’t work. ” Indeed, Mr. Trump’s failure to vet candidates in advance has led to some stumbles. A White House scheduler was fired this past week because of an issue that surfaced in her background check, something that normally would have been completed weeks ago. Another challenge has been Mr. Trump’s implementation of ethics rules that bar White House officials from lobbying for five years after they leave the government, prompting senior congressional officials and lobbyists to demur. Mr. Trump has faulted the Democratic minority in the Senate for obstructing his choices. Democrats have voted almost as a bloc against many of his nominees, breaking with long tradition in which the opposition party largely went along with a president’s selections, except in specific cases of controversy. “The Democrats are making it very difficult,” Mr. Trump said at his news conference on Thursday. “This is pure delay tactics. ” Despite his own experience, one person still urging Republicans to take jobs in the administration is Mr. Abrams. “I have been encouraging everybody to go into the government if offered an appropriate position,” he said. “That was my view, and it’s still my view, because you have one president and one government at a time. ”	1
46	JUPITER, Fla.  —   President Trump said on Saturday that judicial decisions that halted his executive order banning travel from seven predominantly Muslim countries had allowed a flood of refugees to pour into the country. “Our legal system is broken!” Mr. Trump wrote in a Twitter posting a day after he said that he was considering a wholesale rewriting of the executive order to circumvent legal hurdles quickly but had not ruled out appealing the major defeat he suffered in a federal appeals court on Thursday. “SO DANGEROUS!” the president added. Mr. Trump cited a report in The Washington Times that asserted that 77 percent of the refugees who entered the United States since Judge James L. Robart of Federal District Court in Seattle blocked the order on Feb. 3 had been from the seven “suspect countries. ” Still, his allusion to a rush of dangerous refugees is somewhat misleading. According to an analysis of data maintained by the State Department’s Refugee Processing Center, the percentage of refugees arriving from those countries  —   Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen  —   has risen considerably since the directive was suspended, but the weekly total of refugees arriving from the targeted countries has risen by only about 100. And all are stringently vetted. At the same time, refugee arrivals from countries not affected by the order have fallen sharply. Since the judge blocked the ban, 1, 049 of the 1, 462 refugees who have arrived in the United States, or 72 percent, were from the seven countries affected. In Mr. Trump’s first week of office, before he issued his order, more refugees arrived, 2, 108, and 935 of them, representing 44 percent, were from those seven nations. The figures suggest that the State Department and refugee resettlement agencies, which meet weekly to determine which individuals and families to admit to the United States, may be stepping up their efforts to help refugees from the seven countries. Mr. Trump’s order also sought to put an indefinite freeze on Syrian refugee admissions and temporarily suspend the rest of the refugee program until the screening process could be reviewed and made more restrictive. The figures show a similar phenomenon for Syrian refugee arrivals their proportion has nearly doubled since Mr. Trump moved to block them, although that represents a relatively small increase of about 100. While the 296 Syrians who arrived during the president’s first week in office made up 14 percent of the total, the 402 who have entered since his order was blocked amount to 27 percent of all refugee arrivals over that period. Refugees already face the strictest of vetting procedures to enter the United States, a process that takes from 18 months to two years because of multiple layers of security and background checks. Mr. Trump made his Twitter post at the start of a day of golf with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan at his resort in Jupiter, Fla.	1
264	UNITED NATIONS  —   Vitaly I. Churkin, the Russian ambassador to the United Nations, who represented his country through times of domestic tumult and rising tensions with the West, died on Monday morning while at work in Manhattan. He would have turned 65 on Tuesday. The Russian government said he died suddenly but did not specify a cause. The New York City police said there were no indications of foul play. “The outstanding Russian diplomat died in harness,” the Foreign Ministry said in a statement posted on Twitter. The United Nations observed a moment of silence on Monday. His death comes at a critical juncture in   relations, amid allegations of Russian interference in the United States presidential election and President Trump’s praise for his Russian counterpart, Vladimir V. Putin. Relations between the two countries have deteriorated in recent years, and diplomats have been watching whether the dynamics will change under the Trump administration with the appointment of Nikki R. Haley to be the American United Nations envoy. This month, she condemned what she called Russia’s “aggressive” actions in Ukraine. Mr. Churkin, on the same day, lauded her track record in politics. She was governor of South Carolina when Mr. Trump appointed her. “I never underestimate my colleagues,” Mr. Churkin told reporters before posting on Twitter a picture of their first private meeting. Mr. Churkin had been unusually absent during several Security Council meetings recently, but this month he brushed off reporters’ questions about his health. The deputy Russian ambassador, Petr Iliichev, said in brief remarks at a United Nations meeting on Monday that Mr. Churkin had been in the office “until the final moments. ” A Fire Department official said a 911 call had reported a cardiac arrest at the Russian mission on East 67th Street in Manhattan. Police officers from the 19th Precinct station house, across the street, performed cardiopulmonary resuscitation. The medical examiner’s office said an autopsy would be conducted on Tuesday. A police official said Mr. Churkin had a history of medical problems, including leukemia and heart ailments. He had kept them private among his diplomatic colleagues. Mr. Churkin, a former child actor who had starred in three films, two of them biopics about Lenin, was widely considered a masterly diplomat. He could be caustic and wry in equal measure, especially in exchanges with his American counterparts. Once, after Samantha Power, a United Nations ambassador in the Obama administration, scolded him for Russia’s actions in Aleppo, Syria  —   “Are you truly incapable of shame?” she said  —   he accused her of acting like Mother Teresa. Mr. Churkin had been trained as a translator, and as an ambassador, he sometimes became visibly annoyed with United Nations interpreters who could not keep up with his    speaking style. Vitaly Ivanovich Churkin was born in Moscow on Feb. 21, 1952. He held a Ph. D. in history and was a graduate of the Moscow State Institute of International Relations. He began his career in the Soviet era and quickly rose through his country’s diplomatic corps as the Soviet Union was opening up under Mikhail S. Gorbachev. He was a spokesman for the Foreign Ministry from 1990 to 1992, represented his country in peace talks in the former Yugoslavia, and became ambassador to Belgium and Canada before taking on the United Nations post in 2006. He was a forceful defender of the Kremlin under the leadership of Mr. Putin, who issued a statement of condolence on Monday. But Mr. Churkin was not always comfortable with Mr. Putin’s actions, some diplomats said privately. Tom Brokaw of NBC News, who had known Mr. Churkin for many years, recalled that at a lunch at his home in 2015, the ambassador described Mr. Putin’s administration as “a kleptocracy. ” “He was privately very critical of Putin and how he was running the country,” Mr. Brokaw said on Monday. “He was equally critical of the Obama administration. He said: ‘They just don’t get us. They’re not dealing with us the right way. ’” Russia’s relations with the United States soured during Mr. Churkin’s tenure at the United Nations, first over Libya and then over crises in Syria and Ukraine. In an interview in October, he said that   relations had not been so strained since the   conflict nearly brought the two Cold War powers to a military confrontation four decades ago. He was a staunch defender of the Syrian government of Bashar  . He used Russia’s veto at the Security Council to block six resolutions that would have punished the Assad government, including one aimed at referring its actions to the International Criminal Court. He repeatedly questioned all evidence that appeared to point to Syrian or Russian government crimes in Syria and met every Western criticism of Russia’s conduct there with retorts about the West’s role in Yemen and elsewhere. He picked apart every word of every draft resolution to ensure that it satisfied Russian interests. But he could also surprise his fellow diplomats. Last December, he negotiated with his French and American colleagues for three hours in a closed room on the wording of a draft resolution to send United Nations monitors to oversee evacuations from Aleppo. It was the first time in months that the Security Council had reached a consensus on Syria. Mr. Churkin is survived by his wife, Irina Churkina a son, Maksim and a daughter, Anastasia. News of Mr. Churkin’s sudden death sent a shock through the diplomatic community, where he was widely seen as a deft diplomat, skilled at using the rules and protocols of the United Nations to his country’s advantage, including Russia’s veto in the Security Council. Ms. Power, who sparred with him regularly in the Council chambers, said on Twitter that she was “devastated” by the news of Mr. Churkin’s death. “Diplomatic maestro  deeply caring man who did all he cld to bridge   differences,” she wrote. The two were friendly enough that she once took him to see the musical “Hamilton. ” Mr. Churkin recalled that her husband, the legal scholar Cass Sunstein, had sat next to him in the theater and schooled him on the United States Constitution. A previous American ambassador to the United Nations, Susan E. Rice, called Mr. Churkin “highly effective and very funny. ” Mr. Churkin had been the   ambassador on the United Nations Security Council, and he sometimes jokingly referred to himself as the “permanent representative,” the formal title for each member nation’s top envoy to the United Nations.	1
189	Donald J. Trump redrew the electoral map with his rousing economic nationalism and evocation of a lost industrial age. It was a message that drew many union members to his cause. And now it is upending the alliances and tactics of the labor movement itself. In early November, workers at the Momentive chemical plant in upstate New York went on strike to beat back pension and health care concessions. By January, the workers were invoking some of Mr. Trump’s populist campaign themes  —   but with a twist. They planned to picket outside the Manhattan home of the billionaire Stephen A. Schwarzman, whose private equity firm until recently owned a share of the company, and whom Mr. Trump has appointed as an outside adviser on jobs. “We used that angle  —   he’s one of the richest men in the country, has been appointed by Mr. Trump as the   jobs czar,” said Darryl Houshower, vice president of the local. “We were pressuring him, hoping he would put some pressure on the company. ” Whatever happened behind the scenes, they got the result they wanted. The day before the protest was originally planned this month, the company backed off a number of key demands. The workers ratified a new contract several days later. The episode is just one sign of the sudden shifts buffeting the labor movement. Some unions, even if traditionally Democratic, have aims that align with Mr. Trump’s stated priorities: building infrastructure, rewriting trade agreements, blocking an exodus of jobs. But union leaders are in many cases scrambling to get in step with members who responded to his   rhetoric  —   and to tap into that energy. The dynamic was on display earlier this week, when some employees at Boeing’s South Carolina facilities, which Mr. Trump visited Friday, spoke of a rising feeling of empowerment tied to the president’s posture and cited it as a factor in their vote for a union. (The union vote failed.) At Momentive, Mr. Houshower’s local is affiliated with the Communications Workers of America, one of the unions most outspoken in calling Mr. Trump to account since the election. But while he voted for Hillary Clinton, he estimates that some 30 percent to 40 percent of his more than 600 members voted for Mr. Trump. “I think some of the things the president was saying during his campaign, you know, looking to make better jobs in America, bring work back to America, kind of pulled on the strings of the average worker,” Mr. Houshower said. “A lot of guys felt that he was the man to do the job. ” Such sentiments help explain why Mr. Trump came as close among voters from union households as any Republican presidential candidate since 1984. And they are the basis for an approach espoused by his top political adviser, Stephen K. Bannon, who has mused about a tectonic political shift that would rearrange traditional partisan allegiances around economic interests. Surely no small benefit of that realignment would be to divide organized labor, a key Democratic constituency, and the White House has been shrewd about capitalizing on workers’   sentiment. Mr. Trump summoned the heads of the building and construction trade unions, most of which supported Mrs. Clinton, to discuss infrastructure spending three days after his inauguration. “It was a substantial meeting about good   jobs,” said Terry O’Sullivan, general president of the Laborers’ International Union of North America, adding that Mr. Trump was the first president to invite him to the Oval Office. Some of Mr. Trump’s other early moves, like his presidential memorandums giving the   to the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines and killing the   Partnership trade agreement, and his announcement that he would quickly seek to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement, were clearly conceived with a similar objective. They appear to have had the desired effect. Dennis Williams, head of the United Auto Workers union, which endorsed Mrs. Clinton, has professed eagerness to meet with Mr. Trump to discuss how they might undo Nafta and protect American jobs. “He’s the first president that has addressed this issue, and I’m going to give him kudos for that,” Mr. Williams said at a   discussion with reporters in Detroit on Thursday. Other unions may also have reason to do business with the White House. Consider the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, which also endorsed Mrs. Clinton. Some portion of the union, namely its freight railroad workers, is heavily dependent on coal, and union officials say members in that sector voted heavily for Mr. Trump because he refused to foreclose on its role in the national economy. In response, progressives have groused that some   unions are willing to sell their souls for a few thousand jobs. They say that members who enthuse about the president’s ostensible victories for workers, like his efforts to block the manufacturer Carrier from sending jobs to Mexico from Indiana, are utterly blinkered. “  economics dressed in populist garb is still   economics,” wrote Robert B. Reich, labor secretary under President Bill Clinton. All in all, it is precisely the backlash that must delight the current occupants of the West Wing. Still, some labor leaders insist that they will not be so easily divided. “I would not be surprised if Steve Bannon and others would be overtly and covertly trying to divide the labor movement,” said Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers. But she predicted that the effort would ultimately collapse under its own contradictions. The week after Mr. Trump met with the construction trades unions about infrastructure, his press secretary, Sean Spicer, told reporters that “the president believes in right to work,” which would allow workers to opt out of paying union dues or fees. A national    law would thrill congressional Republicans but provoke   opposition from labor. So would a bill recently introduced by Senator Jeff Flake, Republican of Arizona, that would suspend the   Act, which requires the government to pay construction contractors prevailing local wages, specifically on federal highway projects. For that matter, Mr. Trump’s own coalition is hardly a model of cohesion. His first nominee to be labor secretary, the   executive Andrew Puzder, won plaudits in the corporate world with his   views. But he faced criticism on the right over his openness to immigration. Combined with relentless opposition from the labor movement, his nomination proved untenable. It remains to be seen how a new nominee, R. Alexander Acosta, will weather similar scrutiny. Some unions that have opposed Mr. Trump are finding occasions to thread the needle  —   like the Communications Workers of America, the union involved in the Momentive strike and a onetime backer of Senator Bernie Sanders’s progressive presidential campaign. It repeatedly denounced Mr. Puzder’s nomination, but in a continuing dispute with ATT Wireless, it has echoed Mr. Trump’s call not to ship jobs overseas. Unions in the public and service sectors, on the other hand, lack economic interests that would provide common ground with the new administration, and their membership is increasingly urban,   and Hispanic  —   easily alienated by Mr. Trump’s pronouncements on race and immigration. The Service Employees International Union, a leading   force, has taken a largely oppositional stand. Many union leaders are at a loss to explain how Richard L. Trumka, the head of the A. F. L. . I. O. the nation’s   labor federation, will navigate these crosscurrents in the coming months. Mr. Trumka’s answer for the moment is to proceed gingerly. In an interview, he said that he had a productive meeting with Mr. Trump during the transition, and that the president deserved praise for killing the   Partnership trade deal. But he has vigorously protested other policies, like Mr. Trump’s immigration restrictions. “We’re going to call balls and strikes,” he said.	1

829	 A 27 year old mother of 7 nearly starved her kids to death…to keep the food all to herself… http://t.co/m62pMMV4SX pic.twitter.com/BJB8XxT2iJ— MODEaME (@MODEaME) August 19, 2015  A disturbing report is coming out of that Baton Rouge, Louisiana this morning that tells the story of 27-year-old Lakisha Connors who reportedly starved her children nearly to death. The 27-year-old mother of 7 was arrested on Thursday evening when neighbors called police and said they saw extremely unhealthy looking children digging through the trash cans on the side yard. When police arrived and knocked on the door, they were greeted by three-year-old Amonte Connors and five-year-old Dante Connors who let them into the home. Authorities say they found the Lakisha Connors passed out on the couch.Authorities on the scene say when Lakisha was awoke by the police, she was very combative.  “We pulled her up off the couch and asked her to explain herself,” said Hernandes. “When asked why her children were in this condition, Lakisha plainly said, without any remorse, ‘There was only enough food for me! Them kids get on my nerves. But they eat, they eat my scraps. I’m a big girl I need more than them!'”	0
56	Here are the top 10 comments of the week on our digital platforms, as selected by our readers and the journalists who moderate nearly every comment. 1. I’ve been lucky to see many great sports moments in my life (Dave Wottle’s 1972 Olympic   victory might still be number one) including the Super Bowl two years ago. But, this is in the top three somewhere. The poise, the coaching, the team spirit and personal achievement that lets a comeback like this happen without really any one big sensational long td play (although Edelman’s catch  —   one of the greatest ever) or unfair call in their favor, cannot be touched in the    history of the SB. Without slighting any of the amazing players on their team, I couldn’t be prouder today to be a [Tom] Brady and [Bill] Belichick fan. It is about remarkable character, organization and discipline.  —   David H. Eisenberg in Smithtown, N. Y. reacting to an article about Super Bowl LI, won in overtime by the New England Patriots   over the Atlanta Falcons.  2. Anyone who knows Lady Gaga’s music knows it’s socially conscious, drilling the point home about love and acceptance. Pepsi knew this when they asked her to perform. So who is really sending the message? Bravo, Pepsi for not being afraid.  —   Rebecca Rutigliano Davis on The Times’s Facebook page, responding to an article about Lady Gaga’s performance at the Super Bowl halftime show.  3. Buckle up, Mitch: Hell hath no fury like a woman warned.  —   J. Burkett in Austin, Tex. reacting to an article about Republican senators, led by Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, who voted to silence Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, on the eve of Senator Jeff Sessions’ confirmation vote. This comment received more than 4, 500 reader recommendations. 4. It was appropriate that Senator Warren should take her seat after she continued reading an inflammatory, unproven information. We need a return to reason. I am glad to see that the Senate is still functioning amid such hysteria. Senator Warren is championing a hysterical and inflammatory approach toward moving forward. She is convinced of her own righteousness, and is unfit for office, as she and others like her are the bigots, filled with hate and unwilling to hear nor consider opposing points of view.  —   Let’s Be Grown Ups in Louisiana. 5. Do we really want judges making national security decisions? I think the Constitution and the statutes do give presidents broad powers over immigration. We liked that during President Obama’s term. I believe the ban is vulnerable on religious discrimination grounds, but it seems to me that people outside the U. S. do not have any Constitutional rights (unless they have visas or green cards which do give them some rights).  —   JT NC in North Carolina, reacting to an article about a federal appeals panel unanimously rejecting President Trump’s efforts to reinstate a ban on travelers entering the United States from seven largely Muslim countries. 6. I am currently 14 hours into labor with my first child, and this is all the pain relief I need.  —   Anne in San Jose, Calif. This comment received more than 3, 700 reader recommendations. 7. My husband and I still pay the rent for our daughters, one of whom is in culinary school, the other a college student. Yes they have jobs. Yes they pay some of their own bills, but they don’t make enough money to pay rent and we live too far from their schools for them to commute. They will eventually be in a position to be on their own, but for now, we are guaranteeing that they have the chance to succeed.  —   Dena Kendig on The Times’s Facebook page, responding to an article about the nearly half of urbanites in their early 20s whose parents provide them assistance with their housing costs.  This comment received more than 340 likes.  8. Part of being an adult is living within your means  —   not within you and your parents’ means. I feel like the younger generation has missed out on that lesson.  —   Jesse in Houston. This comment received more than 170 reader recommendations. 9. If theaters are going to sell wine and special mixed drinks in souvenir cups, they must have potty parity.  —   Clio in Michigan, reacting to an article about the paucity of bathrooms in many old Broadway theaters and the ensuing long lines at intermission. 10. Mr. Darcy was more ballet dancer than beefcake. Nevertheless, she persisted.  —   Heather Bahniuk Martin on The Times’s Facebook page, responding to an article about a study by British literature professors positing that Mr. Darcy, the romantic hero of “Pride and Prejudice,” would not have been as romantically appealing to modern eyes as Colin Firth, the actor who portrayed him in BBC’s 1995 adaptation.

378	So, the president of the Lakers  —   the one who once posed in Playboy and dated the head coach  —   created a stir last week by firing her brother, who had helped prepare for his job as the head of basketball operations by training horses. To replace him, she hired the franchise icon with the incandescent smile whose first day on the job last Tuesday represented the start of his experience as a basketball executive. His first move was to hire a general manager whose primary qualification seems to be that he was the agent of another Lakers icon, the one with the killer scowl. These novices will be counting on the expertise of the son of the Lakers’ éminence grise, who stormed off years ago when he clashed with the head coach, the one who dated the owner’s daughter. Got all that? All of this is just another drama in the House of Lakers, the   soap opera where familial ties are so inextricably binding they seem to have jumped off the pages of a Tolstoy novel. The Lakers, of course, have been the N. B. A. ’s   for spectacle ever since Jerry Buss bought them, along with the Los Angeles Kings, the once fabulous Forum and a   ranch, from Jack Kent Cooke for $67. 5 million in 1979. “In certain towns, certain teams are the backbone of that town,” said Jeff Shell, the chairman of Universal Filmed Entertainment Group. “In Boston, it’s the Red Sox. From my perspective, the Dodgers and Lakers have always been that. The personality of the Lakers, whether it’s Showtime with Magic or Shaq and Kobe, there’s always been the flash and glitz that personifies the town. ” He continued, “They’ve always been a   organization that takes care of its fans, so you know that even when they’re not winning, they had a plan. ” In recent years, though, that was in question. While celebrities still dot the courtside seats, the Laker Girls still dance and the franchise value has climbed to $2. 7 billion, according to Forbes, the halcyon days of championship runs are a distant memory. The Lakers are again anchored near the bottom of the Western Conference standings, headed for another of their worst seasons since they moved to Los Angeles  —   all since the death of Jerry Buss four years ago. To that end, his daughter Jeanie, who was bequeathed stewardship of the team, decided last Tuesday to ax her brother Jim, the chief basketball   who, three years ago, had given himself a   timeline to restore the championship pedigree his father established by winning 10 N. B. A. championships. And having sent her brother packing, along with Mitch Kupchak, the team’s longtime general manager, Jeanie Buss did what the Lakers have almost always done since her father bought the team. She turned inward. She hired Magic Johnson, the team’s beloved star of the Showtime era, to oversee the team. Working underneath him as the general manager will be Rob Pelinka, who had been the agent for the recently retired Kobe Bryant. They will be joined by an assistant general manager, Ryan West, whose father, Jerry West, starred for the Lakers on the court and as a   architect until he decided he had had enough of Phil Jackson, the team’s coach, after the 2000 season. If there were a Mount Rushmore of Lakers basketball, the visages of West, Johnson and Bryant would be chiseled onto it. “I think everybody’s happy she finally took action,” said Kathy Schloessman, president of the Los Angeles Sports and Entertainment Commission, who has known Jeanie Buss since they took a physics class for nonscience majors at the University of Southern California. “She gave Jim the period of time he asked for, and she realized the brand is important, and she wants to preserve her dad’s legacy. It was taking a beating, and she could only take it for so long. ” While there is skepticism within basketball circles about whether Johnson is best equipped to steer the Lakers in the right direction, it would be hard to find someone in Los Angeles with more good will to expend while trying. “Everybody has a different opinion about Magic’s experience, but he’s definitely committed,” Schloessman said. “He went after this job hard this isn’t a flyby thing. This is important to him. He’s going to be an attractive asset when he’s trying to bring free agents. ” The Lakers have always swung big, back to the days before the Buss family when they worked out trades for Wilt Chamberlain and Kareem   and then with West luring Shaquille O’Neal and having the foresight to see that a    Bryant would be a superstar. Kupchak, West’s protégé, led a more recent renaissance when he plucked Pau Gasol from Memphis, a deal that led to two more titles. But in recent years, the Lakers had begun to regularly whiff. The former commissioner David Stern nixed a trade that would have brought the Lakers the perennial   point guard Chris Paul, and deals for stars like Dwight Howard and Steve Nash bombed. In the last few years, the Lakers failed to land any premier free agents, with LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Carmelo Anthony and LaMarcus Aldridge barely granting them an audience. When the Lakers, flush with   space after Bryant’s retirement and with several promising players to build around, could lure only very modest free agents to come aboard  —   think of Luol Deng and Timofey Mozgov  —   it was clear that time was running out on Jim Buss and Kupchak. The last straw seemed to be when they could not swing a deal last week for the tempestuous   center DeMarcus Cousins, whom Sacramento shipped instead to New Orleans for bupkis. “Magic is such a dynamic leader on and off the court, that’s going to translate to the basketball department,” said Mychal Thompson, a former teammate and the Lakers’ longtime radio color commentator. “When Magic calls, every agent and free agent is going to return his calls. He can get an audience with the Pope. ” If it was easy to see coming, the breadth of Jeanie Buss’s decision was striking. A defining characteristic of the Lakers, along with the championships and the embrace of Hollywood, has been that as the sports industry has become increasingly corporate, the Lakers essentially remained a family operation. All six children of Jerry Buss  —   each of whom owns an 11 percent stake in the team  —   have worked for the Lakers, and four still do: Janie, who heads community relations Joey, who runs the development league team, the   Jesse, who works in the scouting department and Jeanie, whose office sits above the team’s practice court. Nor do you have to be a blood relative to be considered progeny. Lakers Coach Luke Walton is a former fan favorite as a player, as are two of his assistants, Brian Shaw and Mark Madsen. Jordan Wilkes, the son of the former Laker Jamaal Wilkes, is a scout. Linda Rambis, the wife of the former player and coach Kurt Rambis, is an executive. And Jerry Buss said he considered Johnson a son. True, there were often times when the family seemed like a dysfunctional one  —   when Jeanie Buss, who is respected for her business acumen, carried on a longtime relationship with Jackson and when a public feud erupted between the two stars Bryant and O’Neal  —   but until recently, the entanglements never seemed an impediment to winning. And in Hollywood, well, the distractions only seemed to add to the charm. “Big stars mean big drama,” Universal’s Shell said. “Our biggest movie franchise is ‘Fast and the Furious,’ and the stars, Vin Diesel and Dwayne Johnson, they have drama from time to time. As long as you’re winning and giving the fans a good experience, that adds to the fun sometimes. ” However, in recent years, the fun  —   as well as the winning  —   has dissipated, and the family business has become more business than family. With the N. B. A. lockout looming after the 2011 season, the Lakers laid off about 20 staff members, from trainers to equipment managers and scouts, including the longtime assistant general manager Ronnie Lester. A year later, Jim Buss passed over Jackson, who had departed after the 2011 season but was interested in returning, and instead chose Mike D’Antoni as the new coach. Then last week, John Black, the team’s publicist for more than 30 years, was pushed out with Jim Buss and Kupchak, who had been with the Lakers since his playing days. Jeanie Buss, in an interview on the Lakers’ television network, said the decision to shake up the team was so hard to make “that I probably waited too long. ’’ “For that, I apologize to Laker fans,” she said. Where the new direction leads is another matter, as the Lakers, with all eyes on them once again, embrace their past, hoping not to become prisoners to it.	1
319	Imagine the Rolling Stones coming out with a new acoustic album or Christo preparing to wrap some remote island in parachute fabric. That is the kind of anticipation that surrounds the artist Damien Hirst’s first new body of work in several years, to be unveiled in Venice on April 9, a month before the Biennale there. The show, billed as “10 years in the making,” is also the first time the Pinault Collection’s two locations  —   the Palazzo Grassi and the Punta della Dogana  —   will be dedicated to a single artist. Like previous Hirst extravaganzas, this project is being rolled out with the same hypervigilant level of control and fanfare. And hovering over the project is whether  —   given the precipitous drop in his prices after his   Sotheby’s auction in 2008  —   the celebrity artist can have another chapter. Has the   darling of the ’90s  —   who led the   Young British Artists, or Y. B. A. s, and was known for his $12 million shark in a tank  —   jumped the shark? And given that many buyers were left bitterly holding the bag after Mr. Hirst flooded the market with his work at the Sotheby’s sale, doing an end run around his dealers, will collectors give him another chance? “He’s certainly confounded the market before. It depends on how successful the work is,” said Marc Porter, a chairman of Sotheby’s fine art division. “He’s taking on Venice and that’s audacious. ” The project, “Treasures From the Wreck of the Unbelievable,” according to those who have glimpsed it, resembles jeweled buried treasure covered with coral as if just pulled out of the ocean, like relics from the lost city of Atlantis or Captain Nemo. It includes some 250 pieces in various sizes ranging in price from about $400, 000 for small jade objects to $4 million for a malachite head of Medusa. Potential buyers cannot view the work in person, nor can they receive images by email, a courtesy typically afforded top collectors. Instead, a representative from one of Mr. Hirst’s two galleries  —   Gagosian in New York and White Cube in London  —   visits with an iPad to flip through photographs of the work. Mr. Hirst declined to comment, as did his dealers, Larry Gagosian and Jay Jopling of White Cube, who said all news media requests had to go through Mr. Hirst’s studio, Science UK Limited. The Pinault Collection’s owner, François Pinault, also refused to be interviewed his museum has posted just a couple of tantalizing photographs of Mr. Hirst’s coming show on its website. The Venice show is the third prong of Mr. Hirst’s apparent stab at a second act. The first was his opening of the Newport Street Gallery in south London in October 2015, which presents exhibitions of work from his collection. Then in April Mr. Hirst, 51, announced that he was returning to the   Gagosian gallery, having left it in 2012. Already his market is showing signs of strengthening. One of his large butterfly canvases sold at Christie’s in November for a respectable $1 million, given the estimate of $900, 000 to $1. 2 million. Just about everyone in the art world agrees that Mr. Hirst has some healing to do. While he pulled off the unthinkable by selling $200 million of his work at the Sotheby’s sale on Sept. 15, 2008  —   bypassing the usual gallery channels and on the same infamous day that Lehman Brothers declared bankruptcy  —   the result was a surfeit of Hirst pieces on the market, which hurt his prices. “In many ways that auction marked the beginning of the end,” said the dealer Helly Nahmad. Where his pill cabinet “Lullaby Spring” sold at Sotheby’s in 2007 for $19. 2 million, for example, his pill cabinet “Lullaby Winter” sold at Christie’s in 2015 for $4. 6 million. More recently, one of his spot paintings sold in Sotheby’s contemporary art day sale in November for just $396, 500, considerably lower than the $1. 7 million they sometimes fetched in 2013. “People inexplicably bought into that sale, precipitating a downward market death spiral that took us all down with them,” said Adam Lindemann, the collector and dealer, referring to Mr. Hirst’s   Sotheby’s auction. “His market collapsed and hasn’t really revived since. “And now he’s back like Arnold,” Mr. Lindemann continued, referring to a line from Arnold Schwarzenegger’s “Terminator” films. “Remember the old saying, ‘Fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me. ’” Because Mr. Hirst is so prolific, there is the growing sense that his works are ubiquitous, an impression that would be countered, collectors say, by a catalogue raisonné that offered a full accounting of his work. “As an investor, which I am, before undertaking such an investment you have to really make sure that the production is somewhat under control,” Mr. Nahmad said. “The market doesn’t like chaos and the market doesn’t like confusion. If Damien Hirst came out with an extensive catalogue raisonné, people could see an order to his body of work. How many units exist? How many butterflies? How many spot paintings?” At the same time, art experts say, Mr. Hirst is the real deal  —   not just a flash in the pan or a relic of the past, but an artist with exceptional talent and staying power. True, he had the temerity to charge $100 million for a diamond encrusted skull in 2007 and to take over all of Gagosian’s galleries in 2012 (11 of them at the time) with a retrospective of his spot paintings. But Mr. Hirst, collectors, dealers and auction executives say, is worthy of attention, as evidenced by the Tate Modern’s decision to devote a retrospective to his work in 2012. “He is still one of the greatest artists of this century,” said the real estate developer Aby Rosen, who described himself as “long on Hirst” in his art collection, calling the new “Treasures” work “stunning. ” “He will produce till he dies because he has so much brain  —   he’s so deep,” Mr. Rosen added. “And this guy is not going away. ” As to whether collectors unable to sell their Hirsts had a right to be frustrated, Mr. Rosen said: “If you want to be a collector, you have to collect wide and deep, and within your portfolio things will go up and down. If you buy two stocks and one goes down, don’t be angry at IBM or G. M. ” There are those who say that Mr. Hirst’s coming shows in Venice are inextricably linked with Mr. Pinault, who owns Christie’s auction house and has avidly collected Mr. Hirst’s work. Does he want to   the Hirst market out of   art experts ask, to raise the value of his own holdings? Whatever the case, most agree that Mr. Hirst  —   with an estimated net worth of $350 million  —   doesn’t need the money. “I do believe that Damien Hirst  —   especially early Damien Hirst  —   will have an important footprint in art history,” Mr. Nahmad said. “The true   Damien Hirst collectors, if they love what he’s doing now, they’ll buy into it and disregard that this guy so many times in the past has way overproduced. ” Perhaps more than any other artist, Mr. Hirst has embodied the meteoric rise of the artist as celebrity, the auction market at its height and collectors competing to pay millions for a stuffed shark or flattened butterfly. But as art has increasingly become an asset class, Mr. Hirst has also come to symbolize how a   stock can tank. Here, a look back at some of the critical junctures in the volatile yet riveting trajectory of Mr. Hirst. 1991: Formaldehyde Mr. Hirst takes the art world by storm with his tiger shark suspended in formaldehyde, which the billionaire   manager Steven A. Cohen buys for a reported $12 million. 1990s: Butterflies Mr. Hirst explores themes like death and science with butterflies pinned under glass. 2000s: Pill Cabinets Mr. Hirst’s colored, handmade pills recall Victorian curiosity cabinets and explore modern notions of medicine. 2007: Luxe Skulls Mr. Hirst announces sale of his   skull for $100 million. 2008:   Sotheby’s Sale Brings $200 Million Mr. Hirst bypasses dealers to sell all 223 works, breaking the record for a   auction, set in 1993 when an   Picasso sale brought $20 million.  : Tanking at Auction After his Sotheby’s sale, Mr. Hirst’s prices at auction top out at $1. 5 million (for his “Mickey” canvas at Christie’s London in 2014) and eventually fail to sell (his “Beautiful Mickey Mouse Painting,” estimated at $400, 000 to $600, 000 at Christie’s in May 2015). January 2012: Spot Paintings Everywhere Larry Gagosian agrees to show Mr. Hirst’s spot paintings in all of his 11 galleries. December  2012: Hirst Leaves Gagosian Mr. Hirst stuns the art world by announcing that he is leaving the Gagosian gallery, where he has been represented for 17 years. 2016: Hirst and Gagosian Reunite Four years after leaving Larry Gagosian, Mr. Hirst returns to the gallery. “I share a long history with Larry,” the artist says in a statement, “and am pleased we are working together once again. ” Mr. Gagosian says: “Take Damien Hirst out of contemporary art history, and there’s an incredible void. Great artists, like great people, have second acts. ” 2017: Hirst to Unveil a New Work at Pinault Collection in Venice Ten years in the making, Mr. Hirst’s exhibition is to open just before the Venice Biennale, the first time that the two Venetian locations of the Pinault Collection will be dedicated to a single artist.	1

141	WASHINGTON  —   The Trump administration proposed new rules on Wednesday to stabilize health insurance markets roiled by efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act, by big increases in premiums and by the exodus of major insurers. The move came a day after Humana announced that, starting next year, it would completely withdraw from the public marketplaces created by former President Barack Obama’s signature domestic achievement. The proposed rules, backed by insurance companies, would tighten certain enrollment procedures and cut the health law’s open enrollment period in half, in hopes that a smaller but healthier consumer base will put the marketplaces on sounder financial footing and attract more insurance companies in states with limited choices. But part of the market’s problem stems from President Trump’s determination to repeal the health law while the White House and Congress struggle to find a politically acceptable replacement. Even as the Department of Health and Human Services worked to answer insurance company concerns, the Internal Revenue Service and Congress were taking steps that could add uncertainty to the jittery insurance economy. On Capitol Hill, conservatives declared that they are not about to accept a health law replacement that remotely resembles the Affordable Care Act. And the I. R. S. adopted a policy for the coming tax season that could weaken the requirement for people to have insurance. The tax agency said it was reversing one aspect of an Obama administration plan after Mr. Trump, on his first day in office, issued an executive order instructing agencies to reduce burdens imposed by compliance with the Affordable Care Act wherever legally possible. The proposed rules signal the Trump administration’s urgency in trying to keep other insurers from fleeing the market after Humana’s departure. The company said on Tuesday that it was losing money by insuring too many sick people without enough healthy ones enrolling. Humana had already scaled back its participation to 11 states this year, from 19 in 2016. Mark T. Bertolini, the chief executive of Aetna, said Wednesday that the marketplaces were in “a death spiral,” and at a conference sponsored by The Wall Street Journal, he declined to say if his company would participate next year. And Molina Healthcare, one of the few insurers that seemed to be financially successful under the health law, reported on Wednesday that it was losing money in the marketplaces. It threatened to drop out if its concerns about a   program requiring the company to pay hundreds of millions of dollars to other insurers were not addressed. Dr. Patrick H. Conway, the acting administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said the rules proposed on Wednesday “will help protect Americans enrolled in the individual and small group health insurance markets while future reforms are being debated. ” But Democrats and consumer groups denounced the proposed rules, saying they would make it more difficult for people to enroll and increase costs for some consumers. Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the senior Democrat on the Finance Committee, said the rules sent “a clear message to the American people: Patients are not a priority, and insurance companies are back in charge. ” Under the proposed rules, the annual open enrollment period would be reduced to about six weeks from two months. The shorter time frame would be similar to the open enrollment periods for Medicare and for many   health plans. But the administration acknowledged that the shorter   period “could lead to a reduction in enrollees, primarily younger and healthier enrollees” who often sign up near the deadline. Other parts of the rules would limit opportunities for people to hold off on buying insurance until they get sick, a phenomenon that has loaded many health plans offered under the Affordable Care Act with more expensive, sick customers than they expected. By manipulating a system that now precludes insurers from rejecting customers with   medical conditions, consumers are avoiding the purchase of insurance when they are healthy and rushing in when they need it, insurers say. The rules also would require consumers to provide “supporting documentation” to prove they were eligible to enroll in health plans through HealthCare. gov outside the standard open enrollment season. The administration estimated that 650, 000 people annually could have their enrollment delayed because of the new requirement to verify eligibility. People can sign up after the deadline if they experience certain “life changes” like having a baby, getting married or losing   insurance. Insurers have told the government for several years that people who sign up in a special enrollment period use up to 50 percent more services than those who sign up in the regular enrollment season. Insurers and Republican members of Congress welcomed the proposed changes, which will be published in the Federal Register on Friday, giving the public until March 7 to comment. Final rules are likely to be issued in March or April. Insurers must decide by early May what kinds of health plans they will offer in 2018. Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee and chairman of the Senate health committee, said the proposals were “important first steps to rescue a collapsing Obamacare individual market. ’’ But insurers cautioned that the proposed rules, while helpful, would in no way provide a solution if, in a few weeks, Republicans introduce legislation to repeal major provisions of the Affordable Care Act, such as the requirement for most Americans to have coverage. Christopher W. Hansen, the president of the advocacy arm of the American Cancer Society, said the tighter restrictions on special enrollment periods could “cause problems for cancer patients,” delaying treatment and reducing their chances of survival. Changes being made by the I. R. S. could weaken incentives for people to obtain insurance. The tax agency said it would accept and process tax returns even if taxpayers failed to indicate whether they had coverage, qualified for an exemption or were paying the penalty for going without insurance. The individual mandate, requiring most Americans to have insurance, was to be enforced through the tax system. The I. R. S. said the requirement was “still in force until changed by Congress. ” The government can deduct the amount of any penalty from refunds that would otherwise be sent to taxpayers. But it is unclear how it will use this authority. In the rules proposed Wednesday, the Trump administration said that it would generally allow states to determine whether insurance plans had enough doctors, hospitals and other health care providers to serve patients. The hope is that would lure more insurers into the market. Additionally, insurers could refuse to provide new coverage to consumers who failed to pay premiums owed in the previous year. If an insurer terminates coverage for nonpayment of premiums, it could require consumers to pay all   premiums owed to that insurer before restarting coverage. And insurers would be allowed to sell health plans covering a smaller share of expected costs. The administration said consumers would have “more coverage options” as a result, but it acknowledged that some consumers could see increases in their deductibles and other    costs.	1
904	 Rumor that the DOJ is asking local police to switch to purple police uniforms to soften the image of police — sounds crazy (really, the DOJ has better things to do, and I can’t imagine them dictating at this level). My brother, who is in law enforcement, told me about this. Can’t find much about it but here is an example. Last week the President called for police to soften up uniforms to improve public relations. In response the Department of Justice is getting ready to field test new uniforms in friendly colors. Various shades of Purple are being tested as it seems to be universally thought of as a color of friendship.Senior DOJ officials say the idea for purple came up when a college intern made a comment about popular children’s show Barney the purple dinosaur. “So there we were talking about how to soften up the image of the police. Someone in the room asks us all what we think about when ever we think about friendly. No one says a word.

The world’s most wanted and most dangerous drug lord, Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman, is allegedly offering a US$100 million bounty for whoever delivers billionaire and Republican presidential hopeful Donald Trump to him, dead or alive.According to various websites, sources close to the drug trafficker say Guzman was infuriated by Trump’s racist remarks against Mexicans.“He was mad. He wants Donald Trump dead and will pay any amount of money to have Donald Trump’s head,” said an unnamed inmate, according to Most Extreme News.    Mexican lord Joaquín Guzmán is offering a $100 million bounty for anyone who can bring him Donald Trump, dead or alive…According to informants close to El Chapo, the drug lord was offended and furious with Donald Trump’s racists allegations and plans of a Great Wall dividing the United States and Mexico. The bounty was set weeks prior to El Chapo’s escape with the help of other members of the Mexican cartel…“He was mad. He wants Donald Trump dead and will pay any amount of money if meant he could have Donald Trump’s head” explains an unnamed inmate. Guzman and his supporters wasted no time lambasting Mexican president Enrique Pena Nieto as a “coward” but reserved particular ire for Mr Trump, who has accused Mexico of sending rapists and criminals to America.A post riddled with obscenities on a Twitter account, reportedly run by the drug lord’s son Ivan, said the billionaire businessman would be made to “swallow his words”. 	0

35	Wyoming’s Jackson Hole got more of the snow that skiers crave on Tuesday night, but the heavy winds that came with it knocked out power and forced the area’s famed resort to close through the weekend. “This was a very unusual event for us,” said Anna Cole, a spokeswoman for the Jackson Hole Mountain Resort, where the slopes were emptied, hotel guests were relocated and the electricity remained off on Thursday. “This will probably be the longest time that we will have to close during our operating season in our history. ” In ski resort towns across the West, snow is the economic lifeblood, and winter storms are usually coveted. Jackson Hole has already gotten more than 400 inches of snow this season, Ms. Cole said, about as much as the total from last season. But the ferocious winds that accompanied Tuesday’s weather toppled 17 steel electrical poles, local officials said, blocking roadways and turning off the lights at the resort and the surrounding area. Crews are working to restore power and clear the highways, but the weather has scrambled vacation plans and closed   businesses during one of the region’s busiest months. Jason Wallace, from Austin, Tex. was part of a group that rented a house near the resort and planned to ski at Jackson Hole this week. But while waiting for his connecting flight in Denver on Wednesday, he learned of the storm damage and decided to change his plans. He is skiing in Colorado instead. “I think we all were kind of lucky to make the call pretty quickly that it wasn’t going to work,” said Mr. Wallace, who hopes to return to Jackson Hole at some point. A Special Olympics event and Skijoring, described as a mix of “extreme ski and rodeo,” scheduled at the resort this week have been canceled. Jackson Hole’s last multiday closing during ski season was in 1986, Ms. Cole said, when there was a snowstorm and avalanche risk. Resort officials said they did not foresee reopening before Monday. “I don’t know that we’ve had a power outage for this length of time,” said Melissa Turley, executive director of the Teton Village Association, the government agency that oversees the area around the resort. Still, with electrical lines strewed across the roads, Ms. Turley said residents were thankful there had been no reports of injuries or damage to buildings. Local tourism agencies worked with the resort to find hotel rooms for displaced travelers. Though power remains off at the resort, the nearby town of Jackson has electricity, another ski resort and plenty of hotel rooms, said Kate Foster, a spokeswoman for the Jackson Hole Chamber of Commerce. Flights continued to arrive and depart at the Jackson Hole Airport, though major airlines have offered travelers the opportunity to rebook if they would prefer. American Airlines gave its customers the option to request a refund. On Thursday’s American flight from Dallas to Jackson Hole, more than half the seats were still occupied, an airline spokesman said. And in Wyoming, where local officials were weathering an economic blow during what had been a promising ski season, many still saw a silver lining. “When the mountain resort opens,” Ms. Foster said, “it’s going to be amazing skiing. ”	1
548	 According to several recent reports, the Muslim community has made a donation in excess of $87,000 to the family of Orlando nightclub shooter Omar Mateen.It’s currently unknown how the funds will be distributed, however it’s been said that the majority of the $87,000 will be allocated to Omar Mateen’s widow Noor Salman and father Seddique Mateen. Sources indicate that the remaining funds will be distributed among Omar’s siblings. Prior to distributing the donation, the Mateen family is expected to provide Omar with a ‘proper Islamic funeral’.According to reports, the $87,000 was comprised of donations made on behalf of several Islamic Cultural Centers throughout the United States.	0
412	Responding to Bill Cosby’s concerns about the effect of pretrial publicity, a Pennsylvania judge ruled Monday that a jury from another county in the state will be brought in to hear the sexual assault trial against him. But the trial, now scheduled to start in June, will stay in Norristown, a suburb outside Philadelphia, the judge said. Mr. Cosby’s lawyers had argued that the trial should be moved because publicity had tainted any prospective jury in Montgomery County, where prosecutors say he assaulted Andrea Constand, a former Temple University employee, at his home there in 2004. In particular, his lawyers said that prejudicial publicity in the suburban county had been damaging because the district attorney, Kevin R. Steele, who is leading the case against Mr. Cosby, ran advertisements in 2015 accusing his political rival for the office, Bruce L. Castor, of failing to prosecute Mr. Cosby. “Unless you’ve been living under a rock, the message that has been promoted, in insidious fashion, is that Bill Cosby is guilty, and that Bill Cosby is a serial rapist,” a lawyer for Mr. Cosby, Brian J. McMonagle, said during the hearing, according to a report by The Associated Press. “I do not believe that there’s a place anywhere in this country now where he can receive a fair trial. Not here, not anywhere. I hope I’m wrong. ” Mr. Steele had said he did not object to selecting a jury from another county, but opposed moving the trial from Norristown. After a short hearing of less than two hours, Judge Steven T. O’Neill of the Court of Common Pleas in Montgomery County agreed to import a jury, which he said would be sequestered during the trial. Mr. Cosby attended the hearing. He was holding a cane and was helped by an aide as he entered the courthouse. The entertainer, 79, who has complained of weakening eyesight, responded to calls of encouragement from people waiting outside. “Thank you,” he called back at one point. The hearing follows another decision Friday by Judge O’Neill that prosecutors will be able to call one other woman who says Mr. Cosby sexually assaulted her to testify at the trial, but not another 12 accusers from whom Mr. Steele had hoped to draw testimony. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court will decide where in the state the jurors will come from, Art Heinz, a court spokesman, said.	1
271	SEOUL, South Korea  —   The acting president of South Korea, Hwang   on Monday called the killing of Kim   the estranged half brother of North Korea’s leader, “an intolerable crime against humanity and terrorist act” masterminded by the North Korean regime. The remarks were the strongest yet by the South Korean leadership linking the North Korean government, led by Kim   to the brazen killing of Mr. Kim’s half brother on Feb. 13 at Kuala Lumpur International Airport in Malaysia. In his remarks, Mr. Hwang also urged the world to hold North Korea accountable for the killing. “It starkly demonstrated the North Korean regime’s recklessness and cruelty as well as the fact that it will do anything, everything in order to maintain its power,” Mr. Hwang said during a meeting of   cabinet ministers on Monday. “We need to cooperate with the international community to ensure that North Korea will pay a just price for its terrorist act. ” Mr. Hwang’s comments escalated pressure on North Korea by formally accusing Mr. Kim’s government of carrying out a terrorist attack, which could encourage other nations, including the United States, to try to punish the government in Pyongyang. Mr. Hwang instructed his government to strengthen vigilance and precautions against possible North Korean terrorist attacks on the government and citizens of the South. He also warned that North Korea may try military provocations to divert international attention from the killing. The statement came as tensions escalated Monday between North Korea and Malaysia as the police in Kuala Lumpur press on with their investigation of the killing, in which several North Korean citizens are being sought. Fuji TV in Japan posted what appeared to be airport security video footage of the attack on YouTube, which was later reposted by other sources. The North Korean ambassador to Malaysia, Kang Chol, called the Malaysian inquiry politically motivated and demanded that his government be allowed to take part. Mr. Kang also found fault with Kim  ’s autopsy. “It has been seven days since the incident, but there is no clear evidence on the cause of death, and at the moment we cannot trust the investigation by the Malaysian police,” Mr. Kang said. The North Korean Embassy later released a statement trying to raise doubts about whether the body was that of Mr. Kim, faulting the Malaysian authorities for “identifying the other name alleged by the hostile foreign forces. ” The statement said the deceased man, whom it identified as Kim Chol, held a diplomatic passport, and it criticized the Malaysian authorities for requiring the presence of next of kin for the body to be released. The Malaysian Foreign Ministry said it had summoned Mr. Kang to explain his accusation that Malaysia was “colluding” with North Korea’s enemies in its handling of Mr. Kim’s death. Late Monday, the Malaysian foreign minister, Anifah Aman, responded to Mr. Kang’s charges, saying they were based on “delusions, lies and  . ” Mr. Kang’s suggestion that someone else’s hand was behind the investigation was “deeply insulting to Malaysia,” he said in a statement issued by his office. “In all civilized nations, it is the norm for cases such as these to be comprehensively investigated,” Mr. Anifah said. “It is the responsibility of the government to do so. ” Mr. Kim was apparently poisoned by a woman who grabbed him from behind at the airport and wiped his face with a cloth. He died on the way to a hospital. The Malaysian police have arrested four people and are seeking seven others, most of them North Korean. In its meeting with Mr. Kang, the Malaysian government called his accusations “baseless” and said the police were following normal procedures in the case of a death “under mysterious circumstances. ” Malaysia has told North Korea that it will give the body to Mr. Kim’s next of kin once the investigation is complete. “The Malaysian government has been transparent,” the statement said. “The Malaysian government takes very seriously any unfounded attempt to tarnish its reputation. ” The South Korean unification minister, Hong   said on Monday that eight North Koreans were involved in the case, including one who was arrested, four who were believed to have returned home and three others who were still being sought by the Malaysian authorities. Speaking to reporters in Seoul, Mr. Hong declined to reveal the additional information his government had that helped it determine North Korean involvement. But he said the fact that several suspects were from North Korea was significant evidence itself. He also noted that North Korea had a history of committing terrorist attacks abroad and executing its own officials deemed a threat to the country’s leader. “The North Korean regime depends on a reign of terror and fears to help maintain its grip on power,” Mr. Hong said about the possible motive behind the killing. In Indonesia, Agung Sampurno, an Immigration Department spokesman, said that at least three North Korean suspects who left Malaysia in the hours after the killing on Feb. 13 arrived in Jakarta later that day. They left Jakarta at 10:20 p. m. on a flight to Dubai, in the United Arab Emirates, before they were believed to have returned to North Korea.	1
409	At least four automakers knew for years that Takata’s airbags were dangerous and could rupture violently but continued to use those airbags in their vehicles to save on costs, lawyers representing victims of the defect asserted in a court document filed on Monday. The Justice Department’s criminal investigation into Takata’s   airbags has so far painted automakers as unwitting victims duped by a rogue supplier that manipulated safety data to hide a deadly defect, linked to at least 11 deaths and over 100 injuries in the United States. But the fresh allegations against Ford, Honda, Nissan and Toyota, made as part of a   lawsuit in Florida and based on company documents, point to a far deeper involvement by automakers that used Takata’s defective airbags for years. Honda vehemently denied the new allegations on Monday. The three other automakers either declined to comment or said a response would come through legal channels. Last summer, The New York Times reported indications that automakers, rather than being the victims of Takata’s missteps, had pressed their suppliers to put cost before all else. That report focused on General Motors, which is not named in the Florida case, though plaintiff lawyers said they were preparing to take action against the company. The defect has prompted the nation’s largest automotive recall ever, affecting nearly 70 million airbags in 42 million vehicles. The plaintiffs’ filing came hours before Takata pleaded guilty, under a deal announced last month, to charges of wire fraud for providing the false data, a rare outcome for businesses accused of wrongdoing. Federal prosecutors also said last month that they had charged three Takata executives with fabricating test data and fined the Tokyo company $1 billion. “I deeply regret the circumstances that resulted in the agreement today,” Yoichiro Nomura, Takata’s chief executive, said at the federal court hearing in Detroit. The company’s actions were “completely unacceptable,” he said. “Takata is fully committed to ensuring such conduct never happens again,” he added. The allegations in the Florida case came in response to a court document filed by the automakers last week that pointed to Takata’s plea deal to argue that the supplier alone was culpable. But the plaintiffs, who could gain from suing the   automakers alongside Takata, argue that the automakers were more deeply involved in the handling of the defect. The fines and costs associated with the scandal have also taken a heavy financial toll on Takata, and it has been searching for a financial lifeline  —   possibly in the form of a white knight that would effectively take it over. One of the plaintiffs’ lawyers, Kevin R. Dean, filed an objection to Takata’s plea deal on Monday in Detroit, arguing that the automakers were accomplices in the  . He urged the judge to reject the agreement and for the Justice Department to further investigate the automakers’ role. The plaintiffs have taken particular issue with the amount set aside for victims in Takata’s plea  —   a total of $125 million. In contrast, the automakers will have recourse to draw on an $850 million fund to offset continuing recall costs. Judge George Caram Steeh dismissed Mr. Dean’s objections, saying that Takata’s plea deal was in the best interest of the victims. He said any further action against the automakers should be pursued in civil court, and approved the plea deal as is. Randi Johnston, 26, of Farmington, Utah  —   who was injured in September 2015 when the airbag in her 2003 Honda Civic ruptured and metal shards struck her throat  —   attended the hearing and said afterward that she was shocked by the judge’s decision. The shards severed most of her vocal cords, leaving her able to speak only in a whisper. “I really don’t have any words right now,” said Ms. Johnston, a plaintiff in the Florida   case. The filing by the plaintiffs says emails and internal documents turned over by Honda show that in 1999 and 2000, the automaker was intimately involved in developing a problematic propellant, or explosive, used in Takata’s airbags. The propellant is housed in a steel container called the inflater, which in the Takata case can rupture, shooting metal fragments toward the car’s driver or passengers. That propellant, based on a volatile compound, raised concerns internally at Takata at the time, and long plagued the company’s engineers. During testing of Takata’s inflaters in 1999 and 2000 at Honda’s own facilities, at least two inflaters ruptured, according to the filing. Still, Honda pushed a particularly problematic configuration of the propellant over Takata’s objections, the filing said. Honda chose Takata’s airbags because of their relative “inexpensiveness,” the filing quoted Honda documents as saying. The first recalls of Takata’s airbags did not take place until almost a decade later, when Honda recalled 4, 000 vehicles in 2008. The Times has reported that Honda and Takata became aware in 2004 of an airbag explosion in a Honda Accord in Alabama that shot out metal fragments and injured the car’s driver. But the two companies deemed it “an anomaly” and did not issue a recall or seek the involvement of federal safety regulators. On Monday, Honda strongly y denied the allegations in the plaintiffs’ filing. When it installed Takata’s airbags, it said in a statement, “Honda reasonably believed, based on extensive test results provided by Takata, that they were safe. ” Honda said it believed it reacted “promptly and appropriately” in handling known airbag defects. It also said Takata’s airbags had not necessarily been cheaper than those of its competitors. “Sometimes they were more expensive, sometimes less,” the carmaker said. The filing also cites internal documents from Ford, Nissan and Toyota indicating that cost considerations influenced the automakers’ decision to adopt Takata’s airbags in the early 2000s, despite safety concerns. Toyota used Takata’s airbags “primarily” for cost reasons, even though the automaker had “large quality concerns” about Takata and considered the supplier’s quality performance “unacceptable,” the filing said. In 2003, a Takata inflater ruptured at a Toyota facility during testing, the court filing said. In 2005, Nissan began investigating the use of adding a drying agent to Takata’s airbag inflaters out of concern that exposure to moisture made the propellant particularly unstable, the filing says. Takata engineers had long known that its explosive was sensitive to moisture and adopted it despite internal concerns over its safety. Although patents show that its engineers have long struggled to tame the propellant, the company still maintains that the explosive can be stabilized to withstand moist conditions. Ford chose Takata’s inflaters over the objections of the automaker’s own inflater expert, who opposed the use of Takata’s propellant because of its instability and sensitivity to moisture, the filing said. Ford overrode those objections because it thought Takata was the only supplier that could provide the large number of inflaters Ford needed, the filing says. The filing says that Ford, Honda, Nissan and Toyota were also aware of instances of ruptures years before any recalls. It also mentions the German carmaker BMW and points to circumstantial evidence that BMW was similarly involved in what federal prosecutors, in their criminal complaint and in announcing the Takata   agreement, have called a  . But BMW has so far refused to submit documents in the case, the filing says. Representatives of Nissan and BMW said the companies could not comment on active cases. A Toyota representative also declined to comment. A Ford spokeswoman said the automaker would respond through appropriate legal channels.	1
561	 After Sunday’s mass shooting in Orlando, which left 50 Americans dead and 53 wounded, President Obama decided to take unilateral action on gun control by signing Executive Order 13691. The new law bans all sales of assault weapons and places a mandatory 30 day waiting period on all firearm sales, regardless of whether the transaction takes place at a gun dealership or gun show.Executive Order 13691 goes into effect July 1st, 2016. The Obama Administration has setup a hotline for individuals to report those who are not abiding by the new law. To encourage the public’s help in cracking down on those who are not following the law, a $500 reward is being offered. The administration urges you to call (785) 273-0325 with any information that you may have, and as always, you can remain anonymous. In order to address cyber threats to public health and safety, national security, and economic security of the United States, private companies, nonprofit organizations, executive departments and agencies (agencies), and other entities must be able to share information related to cybersecurity risks and incidents and collaborate to respond in as close to real time as possible.Organizations engaged in the sharing of information related to cybersecurity risks and incidents play an invaluable role in the collective cybersecurity of the United States. The purpose of this order is to encourage the voluntary formation of such organizations, to establish mechanisms to continually improve the capabilities and functions of these organizations, and to better allow these organizations to partner with the Federal Government on a voluntary basis.Such information sharing must be conducted in a manner that protects the privacy and civil liberties of individuals, that preserves business confidentiality, that safeguards the information being shared, and that protects the ability of the Government to detect, investigate, prevent, and respond to cyber threats to the public health and safety, national security, and economic security of the United States. Being tough on terrorism, particularly the sorts of homegrown terrorism that we’ve seen now in Orlando and San Bernardino, means making it harder for people who want to kill Americans to get their hands on assault weapons that are capable of killing dozens of innocents as quickly as possible.	0
104	BERLIN  —   She is considered the indispensable European, yet one of the biggest questions looming over the Continent’s crucial elections this year is whether Germany still regards Angela Merkel as indispensable, too. Seven months before national elections in Germany, the prevailing wisdom has held that Ms. Merkel, now seeking a fourth   term as chancellor, is most vulnerable to the rising popularity of the country’s far right, just as other populist,   parties are gaining in coming elections in the Netherlands and France. Yet suddenly, Germany’s left has unexpectedly resurged, prompting Der Spiegel magazine this weekend to pose a question on its cover: “Will She Fall?” A reliable answer is not in sight. The shocks of 2016  —   Britain’s vote to leave the European Union and the election of Donald J. Trump as president of the United States  —   have profoundly shaken Germany, which depends more than any other European nation on Pax Americana and global institutions set up after World War II. But on Sunday, the rebound of the left  —   along with the broad German distaste for Mr. Trump that has helped fuel it  —   was on full display. The   Social Democrat   Steinmeier, who has served in Ms. Merkel’s coalition government as foreign minister for seven years, won the presidency with 931 votes in the   assembly that elects the president to a   term. Despite being a largely ceremonial position, the presidency provides stature and an important platform for Mr. Steinmeier, a popular and charismatic politician. In his brief acceptance speech, he encouraged Germans to be bold in difficult times. “If we want to give others courage, then we must have some ourselves,” he said on a day when many other speakers evoked the country’s dark past and its emergence as a democracy after the Nazis’ defeat in World War II. One marvel of traveling the world, he said, was to realize that Germany has become a model. “Isn’t it wonderful that this, our difficult fatherland, is seen as an anchor of hope for many people in the world?” Mr. Steinmeier said. Before the vote, the conservative head of parliament, Norbert Lammert, gave a surprisingly fiery speech that  —   without mentioning names  —   attacked Mr. Trump and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia for trying to divide or weaken Europe. “Whoever champions a closed mind instead of openness to the world, whoever literally walls themselves in, bets on protectionism instead of free trade and preaches isolationism instead of states cooperating, and declares ‘We first’ as a program, should not be surprised if others do the same  —   with all the fatal side effects for international ties which we know from the 20th century,” Mr. Lammert said. That goes, he added, for individual European states “but also for our great partner country across the Atlantic. ” Once, it would have been rare for German politicians to lecture other democracies on values, especially the United States, but Germany is now regarded as a critical pillar in upholding the liberal Western order, which is one reason the Sept. 24 national elections are being watched so closely. It is also why some of Ms. Merkel’s fellow conservatives quietly grumbled that she was outfoxed when she agreed to put Mr. Steinmeier forward as the presidential candidate of her grand coalition government, which unites her conservative bloc with the   Social Democrats. Even as the presidency stands above party politics, Mr. Steinmeier, 61, a lawyer and lifelong politician, is likely to be a boon for his party. His election coincided with a Social Democratic surge in polls since the   chose Martin Schulz, a former president of the European Parliament, to lead them into battle against Ms. Merkel in the elections. Mr. Schulz grew up in a village in the Aachen area, becoming mayor of the nearby town of Würselen in 1987, and likes to tell stories from those days to portray himself as an ordinary guy. He first won election to the European Parliament in 1994, going on to become president in 2012. Most unusually for a German politician, he did not finish high school with a certificate, and trained initially as a bookseller. He outpolled Ms. Merkel in personal popularity, 50 percent to 34 percent, in the Infratest dimap survey this month, albeit with a slightly smaller degree of support than Ms. Merkel’s last Social Democratic challenger had at a similar stage of the 2013 race. Perhaps because he has spent most of his political career in European institutions in Brussels, Mr. Schulz can appear fresh to German voters. “What he is doing is filling a vacuum which has obviously arisen,” said Franz Müntefering, a veteran Social Democratic leader. “He is reaching people through emotions. ” In its weekend cover story, Der Spiegel described the current period as “the twilight of Merkel” and noted that she had appeared listless of late. Ms. Merkel’s conservative bloc appears somewhat rattled. Her respected finance minister, Wolfgang Schäuble, the   member of Germany’s parliament, used an interview in Der Spiegel this weekend to accuse Mr. Schulz of   populism. “When Schulz lets his supporters shout, ‘Make Europe great again,’ then it is almost word for word Trump,” Mr. Schäuble told the newsmagazine. Sigmar Gabriel, the Social Democrat who has replaced Mr. Steinmeier as foreign minister, swiftly retaliated: “The radical and   mockery” in American politics “should not be swept in to Germany,” he said. Unquestionably, Mr. Trump’s election has so deeply altered the geopolitical landscape for Ms. Merkel. She has kept a cool distance, and the two leaders are expected to meet for the first time this spring. Domestically, Ms. Merkel is contending with a continuing political backlash to her 2015 decision to admit more than one million migrants, many of them Muslim, into the country. The   Alternative for Germany party, which started as a movement against the euro currency, now carries an     message and has leaders who have sympathy for Mr. Trump’s politics. Tellingly, Frauke Petry and other Alternative for Germany leaders did not applaud with everyone else during Mr. Lammert’s speech when he attacked isolationism or what he termed a “We first” attitude. Under pressure, Ms. Merkel has backpedaled somewhat in recent months, reducing the influx of migrants and taking a tougher line on deportations. As is often the case, people outside the bubble of national politics sounded considerably less stirred when asked about Ms. Merkel’s standing. Metin Elcivan, 41, who helps run a corner store in western Berlin’s Schöneberg district, was certain that German voters would prove conservative. “I think nothing will change at the elections,” he said, “and that we will have a grand coalition again, with Merkel as chancellor. ”	1

312	He has been the host of the Emmy Awards, the ESPY Awards, the American Music Awards, the “Comedy Central Roast of Pamela Anderson” and, for 14 years, his ABC   show “Jimmy Kimmel Live! ,” so it’s only fair that Jimmy Kimmel should at last be allowed to host the Academy Awards. He’ll finally get his chance this Sunday, the first time in nearly a decade that a working   star will be M. C. of the Oscars. Mr. Kimmel, 49, is taking on this award show in a year when there doesn’t seem to be much mystery about which major nominees will win. And he’ll have to find a way to connect with a nationwide audience at a fractious time, when political tempers are running high. So, no pressure there. As Mr. Kimmel said in a recent telephone interview, speaking from the El Capitan Theater in Los Angeles where “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” is produced: “I’ve come to terms with the fact that someone is going to be disappointed in me at the end. I just don’t know who it will be yet. ” Days before he steps onto the Dolby Theater stage, in front of tens of millions of people, Mr. Kimmel spoke about the challenges of making this show while still working his day job and trying to find a sweet spot between a program with too much political content and one with not enough. These are edited excerpts from that conversation. How are the preparations going? Where do you even find the time? What, am I supposed to be planning something? I was thinking I would wing it. No one’s ever done that before. We’ll do some crowd work and see how it goes. [Laughs] We do it in whatever spare time we have. After the show, I usually spend an hour or two on the Oscars, and dedicate Fridays to   and planning and interviews and meetings, promo shoots. Eventually it adds up. Does hosting a nightly talk show better prepare you for a challenge like this? When you do a show every night, hosting an awards show doesn’t seem as monumental a task as it might. Really, when you break it down, it’s like a   monologue and a couple of taped pieces, then some intros and jokes along the way. You have to give out awards for all the categories, and you want to keep the show under nine hours long. You don’t have a ton of room to play with. Are you approaching this as a potential audition to host again in future years?  That’s definitely not something I have in mind. [Laughs] You never know how these things have gone until you step offstage and read what a bunch of strangers thought. All your friends tell you it was great, no matter what you did, and your mother thinks it’s wonderful. Obviously it’s an honor, but the workload cannot be ignored. How do you make peace with this? It’s not even really about the work  —   it’s the anxiety leading up to the event itself, and the general malaise that I put my family through. I said to my wife this morning, “What if, to save time, instead of using the word ‘categories,’ we just called them ‘cats’?” And she pointed out that I would waste more time just explaining that. Given recent award shows and the general tenor of the moment, are you expecting a lot of political speeches? Is there a point where that becomes too much? There definitely is a point at which that becomes too much. There’s also a point at which it becomes too little. And finding that balance is, for me, the most difficult hurdle, when it comes to this broadcast. We don’t know what our mood in this country is going to be on Sunday. We seem to be in a very temperamental period. We’re having wild mood swings as a nation right now. Hopefully everyone will be in a good mood that night. Given that Donald J. Trump won the presidency and the Patriots won the Super Bowl, does that ensure that “La La Land” will win best picture? I don’t know if they go   . But my plan is, I’m going to tank the first half of the Oscars. And then lead a furious comeback in the second four hours. Do you also see this as an opportunity to promote your ABC show? Well, let’s be honest: There’s a good chunk of America that doesn’t know that Jimmy Fallon and I are different people. So I’m not going to go into this presuming that they know me and all my bits. You need to approach this without any ego. If there’s too much inside stuff, it won’t work. So we shouldn’t expect to see Guillermo in any Oscars bits? I think that would be confusing to a lot of people. He’ll be working anyway  —   out on the red carpet, corralling people. People are shocked to hear that we have a show the next night and all week after that. It’s not like we can relax after it  —   we’ve got to get right back on the pony. There’s no point, really, to doing this if you don’t carry that momentum into your nightly show. In recent weeks, Stephen Colbert’s “Late Show” has been drawing more viewers than Jimmy Fallon’s “Tonight Show. ” Do you think it’s a sign that audiences want more pointed topical comedy? This is all fake news. [Laughs] I mean, that’s a very simple way of looking at the ratings. People seem to forget how important your   is, too. When “The Voice” comes back, so will the ratings of “The Tonight Show. ” We’re all pretty lucky right now  —   all the   shows  —   that more people are watching and reacting. I think everyone loves to have a story line, and people get excited if the tide is turning. But any mathematician would bang you over the head with his calculator. There’s a category of   hosts  —   Mr. Colbert, Seth Meyers, Samantha Bee, John Oliver, Trevor Noah  —   who seem to own the   beat. Do you worry about being left out of this group? It doesn’t worry me. I think it’s wrong. If anything, my concern is, do we do too much Trump stuff on the show? My monologue is at least 50 percent Donald Trump, and it’s not all light commentary. My focus is to comment on what people are talking about. It just so happens that this is what people are talking about. Right now, you go to dinner, and everyone wants to talk about Donald Trump the whole time. Love ’em or hate ’em, he is Topic No. 1, 2 and 4. Would you want to host this year’s White House Correspondents’ Association dinner? If it seemed like it was going to be very uncomfortable, I would consider it. I’m attracted to that kind of situation. But I don’t know that it would be worth all the blowback. I did it once  —   it went well. Why put myself through that nightmare again? My dream is to be only saddled with doing [the talk show]. That would be just fine with me.	1

448	It’s clear that President Trump prefers the   glamour of his    estate in Florida to the woodsy charms of Camp David, the secluded traditional presidential retreat in Maryland. Before winning the presidential election, he told a reporter: Mr. Trump has flown on Air Force One to the club in Palm Beach, Fla. for weekend retreats three times since entering the White House. He is expected to return again this weekend. But he has made zero trips to Camp David, a roughly   ride on Marine One from the White House. At this point in their presidencies, Barack Obama had visited Camp David once, while George W. Bush had traveled there three times. During their two terms in office, Mr. Obama racked up 39 visits over 93 days, and Mr. Bush had 149 visits over 487 days. When it comes to running the country or carving out time for a respite, there are perks and drawbacks to both    and Camp David. Here’s how they stack up. It comes down to the   question: mountains or beach? Camp David had a humbling start. Officially a Navy installation, it was built by the Works Progress Administration and opened in 1938 as Camp   180 acres of public land set aside as a destination for government employees. It was not used by a president until 1942, when Franklin D. Roosevelt wanted to escape the muggy climate of Washington, which had taken a toll on his sinuses. The Secret Service scouted for quick getaways within 100 miles of Washington and settled on the site on Maryland’s Catoctin Mountain. The conversion cost back then: $18, 650, according to the National Park Service. The weather is about 10 degrees cooler there than in Washington. The property has cabins, trails, a swimming pool and many, many trees. The president sleeps in the Aspen Lodge. Roosevelt took one look at the site and named it  . President Harry S. Truman made the camp the official presidential retreat in 1945. But it was President Dwight D. Eisenhower who “made it a household name,” according to the Eisenhower Presidential Library. Eisenhower renamed it in 1953 in honor of his    grandson Dwight David Eisenhower II. Successive presidents have used the retreat to write, meet with top advisers, conduct global diplomacy and forge a historic peace accord. In 1974, The New York Times wrote that the property’s seclusion was its main attraction: It “has provided eight American presidents and their families with perhaps the nearest thing to true privacy that they can know during their terms in public life and in the public eye. ”    on the other hand, is a     Mediterranean estate on 20 acres between the Intracoastal Waterway and the Atlantic Ocean. The property, costing $8 million, opened in 1927 as the palatial winter residence of Marjorie Merriweather Post, the heiress to General Foods. On Ms. Post’s death, in 1973,    was willed to the federal government and presented as a possible presidential retreat. President Richard M. Nixon  visited the Palm Beach estate to scout it out, but the property was returned to the Post Foundation because of concerns it was too costly to maintain ($1 million a year) and too difficult to secure (it was in the flight path to Palm Beach International Airport). The foundation sold the property to Mr. Trump in 1986, who turned it into a private club in 1995. The property includes a tunnel for guests to travel to the beach (and underneath Ocean Boulevard) and a private      pool. * Winner for historical significance: Camp David. We’ll cut to the chase: You are not going to visit Camp David. If you search online for how to get to the site, you’ll most likely stumble upon a site that says cabins can be booked for $1, 200 for a weekend. Ignore it. It’s a parody site. The retreat is closed to the public. You may not be able to get within shouting distance of the president at Camp David. But by joining    for a $200, 000 membership fee, you can get fairly close to President Trump. You may even be able to watch while White House officials, sitting feet from you, work by the light of their cellphones to respond to an international crisis. And you can take pictures. Clubgoers have witnessed Mr. Trump dining at the club, meeting with the leader of Japan and, most astonishingly, huddling in plain sight with his aides as they grappled with how the United States should respond to a missile test by North Korea. If you cannot afford the hefty membership fee, you may know a   friend who is getting married at    and snare an invitation to the celebration. * Winner for accessibility:   . Camp David has a seemingly endless number of options to escape the whirlwind pace of the White House or the noise of protesters in Washington. Mr. Obama, for instance, shot skeet and water guns, and played pool and basketball. Mr. Bush had bike trails installed so that he could ride in private. Presidents Gerald R. Ford and George H. W. Bush played  tennis.    is not short on amenities: It offers a spa and a salon and popular sports of yesteryear like bridge (classes are offered by “a certified master instructor”) and croquet. The croquet court is described on the club’s website in Trumpian terms: “Boasting one of the most beautiful lawns in the country, the    Club venue will not only challenge both mind and body, but will also add a sense of serenity so seldom found in competitive sports. ” But the club also affords proximity to places where you can play that most freighted of geopolitical games: golf. Trump National golf courses are nearby in Jupiter and West Palm Beach. * Winner for perks:    edges out Camp David because even if croquet isn’t our speed, the wonders of the Sunshine State are still available. Even before Mr. Trump called    the “Southern White House,” the exclusive   club was not easily accessible to the public. It has high walls, which date to when Ms. Post owned the property, and a security gate. Now, when the president visits, roads are blocked off, the Coast Guard patrols the shoreline, a   zone is enacted, and the Secret Service is deployed.    neighbors are fretting about the logistics headaches and potential loss of revenue whenever the president visits. The security at Camp David is fairly straightforward: It is surrounded by   fencing. More important, the site is also known as Naval Support Facility Thurmont, which sums up its level of protection. Members of the Navy and the Marines are permanently stationed there. * Winner for seclusion and security: Camp David. Presidents have hosted royalty and many foreign leaders at Camp David, as well as top advisers and cabinet members. Visitors stay in one of the many cabins on the property. Roosevelt and Winston Churchill met there during World War II. In 1959, at the height of the Cold War, Eisenhower hosted Nikita Khrushchev of the Soviet Union. In September 1978, through the intervention of President Jimmy Carter, the retreat was the site of a historic peace agreement (the Camp David Accords) between President Anwar Sadat of Egypt and Prime Minister Menachem Begin of Israel. Mr. Obama hosted a meeting of the Group of 8 leaders at the retreat in 2012. President Bill Clinton held intense meetings there in 2000 with Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel and the Palestinian leader Yasir Arafat to try to broker a peace deal. The gathering offered a case study in using body language as a power play: An infamous tussle ensued as the opponents grabbed and stepped around each other and tried not to be the first man to go through a door at Camp David, as if that leader would appear to cede some power.    was created to entertain, and spares no expense. It was built with stone from Italy, 36, 000 antique tiles from Spain and roofing tile from Cuba. The first references to the villa in The Times, in 1927, were about lavish parties and ballets held there. Ms. Post had a feeling that her Palm Beach villa could be used for presidents and foreign leaders. In 1972, after the villa was willed to the government and offered as a “winter White House,” an adviser suggested that foreign leaders could stay at the estate on their first stop in the United States, rest a few days and then continue on to Washington to meet with American leaders. When Nixon took a helicopter trip to make an unannounced visit to    in July 1974 to “determine its potential,” he wandered the property for exactly 31 minutes. Alas, Ms. Post’s hope of having her estate turned into a presidential retreat did not bear fruit then  —   at least, until the arrival of Mr. Trump.  *Winner over all:    for at least the next four years, though Mr. Trump may visit Camp David yet.	1
37	HONG KONG  —   Hundreds of pilot whales that swam into a shallow New Zealand bay died overnight after they got stuck in the waterway and beached themselves on the coastline. More than 500 rescuers tried frantically to send the pilot whales back out to sea, but at least 250 died in what officials called one of the worst whale strandings in New Zealand’s history. Attempts to refloat the remaining whales during high tide met with partial success. About 50 whales had swum out of the bay after high tide, according to the Department of Conservation, but as many as 90 others had rebeached themselves by Friday afternoon. Volunteers said they would try to refloat the stranded whales again on Saturday. Whale strandings at Farewell Spit, at the northern tip of New Zealand’s South Island, happen most years, Kath Inwood, a ranger, told The Associated Press. But the high number of whales trapped this year has surprised conservation officials. The whale stranding was the largest in the country since 1985, when 450 were stranded near Auckland. New Zealand has one of the highest rates of whale strandings, which are believed to occur when the mammals, who are known for their social bonding, make navigational mistakes while chasing prey, escaping predators or trying to protect sick members of the group.	1
248	The coming trial of Robert A. Durst in Los Angeles may not have the star power of the 1995 murder trial of O. J. Simpson, the former N. F. L. running back and actor. Mr. Durst, although the offspring of a   Manhattan real estate family, does not have a similar claim to fame. He is charged with killing a confidante in her Los Angeles home 17 years ago for fear that she would cooperate with a renewed investigation into the disappearance of his first wife. But he drew widespread attention as the central figure in a 2015   HBO documentary  —   “The Jinx: The Life and Deaths of Robert Durst”  —   that was broadcast internationally. Like Mr. Simpson, Mr. Durst, 73, has his own Dream Team of defense lawyers, including Dick DeGuerin and Chip Lewis, who won an acquittal for Mr. Durst in a 2003 murder trial in Texas David Z. Chesnoff, who has represented celebrities and mob figures and Donald M. Re, who represented a friend of Mr. Simpson’s in that 1995 trial. So it was perhaps fitting that Mr. Durst’s pretrial hearing last week in Los Angeles Superior Court had all the makings of a media frenzy. To gain access to the courtroom, the major television networks vied with TMZ, BuzzFeed, City News Service, Bloomberg, The Associated Press, Fox News, Courthouse News Service, Reuters, The Los Angeles Times, The Daily News, The New York Times and assorted bloggers. There were no cameras allowed at the hearing, however, because of a “mystery witness” who was being protected day and night by a Los Angeles SWAT team. Mary Hearn, the Superior Court’s director of public information, kept careful track of who filled the 42 seats inside the   court. The New York Times was not on “the list. ” But after some huffing and puffing, I was able to get inside. Six members of the defense team took up the seats in the gallery behind Mr. Durst, possibly to prevent reporters from getting too close to him. At least some of the reporters covering the hearing had not yet been born when Mr. Durst’s very twisty story began in 1982 with the vanishing of his wife, Kathleen Durst, several months before she would have graduated from medical school. Mr. Durst’s trial will most likely not take place until next year. But under California law, the prosecution can put witnesses on the stand who are 65 or older if there is a possibility the witness might not make it to trial, or if the witness is in potential danger. John Lewin, the deputy district attorney handling the case, explained that the “mystery witness” needed protection because Mr. Durst “kills witnesses,” a description that brought objections from the defense. Mr. Lewin may have a reason for obtaining testimony before the trial other than simply to preserve witness statements. He may be trying to send a message to Mr. Durst, who sat impassively in court listening to the proceeding over a pair of headphones: We’ve got you give up. The Dream Team is up against a prosecutor, and perhaps a less dreamy team of assistants, who has built a considerable reputation for winning cold cases. Mr. Lewin is bringing a circumstantial case. There were no witnesses to the   killing of Susan Berman, Mr. Durst’s close friend. Although Mr. Durst has never been charged with the murder of his first wife, and her body has not been found, Mr. Lewin has planned to describe how Mr. Durst killed her in 1982. Mr. Durst has been his own worst enemy in the case, having made a series of damaging statements in “The Jinx” in a nearly   interrogation by Mr. Lewin in New Orleans, after he was arrested on a Los Angeles murder warrant and in conversations with his friends. It remains to be seen, however, how much of that material will be admitted in court. The first witness last Tuesday was Albert Kuperman, an    former dean of the medical school that Kathleen Durst attended between 1978 and 1982. Although he knew her only in passing, he described her as a diligent student. The crux of his testimony had to do with a telephone call to his office on Feb. 1, 1982, the day after Ms. Durst disappeared, from a woman who may or may not have been her. Mr. Kuperman said he could not be sure who the caller was. Investigators have long suspected that Mr. Durst’s friend, Ms. Berman, made the call at his behest, after Ms. Durst was dead. The defense challenged Mr. Kuperman with his prior statements to investigators in 1982 and to the producers of “The Jinx,” in which he seemed far more certain that the caller was Ms. Durst. Mr. Kuperman said that no one had ever asked him how often he had spoken to Ms. Durst or how well he might recognize her voice. I briefly became the story before testimony resumed on Wednesday. The court had to review a motion by the defense to sequester me from the trial. Mr. Chesnoff argued that I had “spent a career investigating Mr. Durst and circumstances surrounding Mr. Durst’s entanglements. ” Indeed, I have been writing about Mr. Durst for a long time. During interviews with the prosecutor, Mr. Chesnoff said, the “mystery witness” claimed to be a friend of mine. The defense planned to call me as a witness in the hope that I would be able to impeach the mystery witness’s current testimony by referring to my interviews with the witness over the past 17 years. “Mr. Bagli,” Mr. Chesnoff said, “is a lot more credible than the secret witness. ” A lawyer for The New York Times, Theodore M. Kider, said that sequestration would be a “dangerous and unprecedented” violation of the First Amendment. He said sequestering, in essence, would penalize a reporter for doing a good job. Besides, he added, California’s shield law would prevent the defense from calling a reporter as a witness. Judge Mark E. Windham rejected the defense motion, and the hearings resumed. Then came the “mystery witness”: Nick Chavin, a New York real estate advertising executive who was close to both Mr. Durst and Ms. Berman for many years. A   members of the SWAT team sat in the jury box during his testimony. Mr. Chavin offered two striking stories. After Kathleen Durst vanished, he said, Ms. Berman told him on several occasions that “Bobby” had killed his wife. She said that nothing could be done about “Kathie” but that they had a duty to protect “Bobby. ” Mr. Chavin initially testified that he did not believe her. Ms. Berman, he said, was a “liar” and had a penchant for the dramatic. It was a story he told me in 2000 and for years afterward. But his view of his longtime friend changed, Mr. Chavin said, after he went to dinner in Manhattan with Mr. Durst. Mr. Chavin testified that as the two men parted that night, Mr. Durst said: “I had to. It was her or me I had no choice. ” Mr. Chavin then described a   period in 2015 of torment as Mr. Lewin, the prosecutor, sought his cooperation. He said he was torn between his loyalty to his friend and a desire to honor the memory of his other best friend, Ms. Berman. The defense peppered Mr. Chavin with questions, suggesting that he had made up the story about Mr. Durst’s confession.	1
161	WASHINGTON  —   President Trump took aim at reporters on Thursday for more than an hour at an impromptu White House news conference. “The press has become so dishonest,” he said, and not talking about it would be “doing a tremendous disservice to the American people. ” He added that the “level of dishonesty is out of control. ” In accusing the news media, though, Mr. Trump uttered several falsehoods of his own. Here is a list of some of the most important. Mr. Trump won 306 Electoral College votes (and ended up with 304 officially) well above the threshold needed to secure the presidency but well behind several of his most recent predecessors. President Barack Obama won 332 Electoral College votes in 2012 and 365 four years earlier. President Bill Clinton received 370 Electoral College votes in 1992 and 379 in 1996. And President George Bush won 426 Electoral College votes in 1988. When a reporter pressed Mr. Trump on the claim, he laid the blame elsewhere. “I was given that information,” he said. Mr. Trump said the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which upheld a temporary restraining order on his targeted travel ban, was “in chaos. ” There is no evidence of that. The decision by the Ninth Circuit’s   panel in the travel ban case was unanimous. Mr. Trump also claimed that the court was “a circuit that has been overturned at a record number. ” He was apparently referring to the Ninth Circuit’s reversal rate, which the president cited correctly: “I find that hard to believe, that is just a number I heard, that they are overturned 80 percent of the time. ” PolitiFact found that of the cases the Supreme Court took up from the Ninth Circuit, about 79 percent were reversed from 2010 to 2015. But that was not the highest rate among the nation’s 13 appeals courts. The Sixth Circuit (87 percent) and 11th Circuit (85 percent) each had a greater percentage of reviewed decisions reversed. For all appellate court cases in that period, the Supreme Court reversed decisions about 70 percent of the time. By most definitions, the economy is not a mess, nor is it in recession. The unemployment rate in January was 4. 8 percent, compared with 7. 8 percent in January 2009, when Mr. Obama took office. Last month, the economy added 227, 000 jobs, even though the unemployment rate is already low. The number of people filing new claims for jobless benefits continues to hit lows not seen in decades. Other measures suggest the same thing, as our colleagues at The Upshot report: The economy seems to be taking off. Mr. Trump correctly cited the daily presidential tracking poll by Rasmussen. But the poll is an outlier, giving Mr. Trump an approval rating several points higher than others in the field. Real Clear Politics’ average of approval ratings finds that 44. 6 percent of Americans approve of the job Mr. Trump is doing, compared with 50. 3 percent who disapprove. Gallup’s daily job approval tracker puts Mr. Trump’s approval rating at 40 percent, the lowest since he has taken office, and disapproval at 54 percent.   percent of respondents to a Pew Research Center poll released on Tuesday approve of Mr. Trump’s performance, while 56 percent disapproved. The claim is not a new one for Mr. Trump, and has been fodder for fact checkers since September. Behind it is the purchase by Russia’s nuclear power agency of a controlling interest in a   company that has assets in the United States, including mills, mines and land used for producing uranium. Mr. Trump’s claim is incorrect on at least two points. First, the company’s American assets were equal to 20 percent of the country’s uranium production capacity  —   not its produced uranium, as Mr. Trump suggested. Second, Mrs. Clinton was not in a position to approve of or reject the deal herself as secretary of state. Though the State Department did sign off on it, so did eight other federal agencies. It is unclear whether Mrs. Clinton was briefed about or weighed in on the State Department’s decision. Mr. Trump’s instinct to hedge on the news media’s approval rating was right. The news media does not enjoy a great reputation among Americans, according to a variety of polls in recent years, but Congress fares worse. Gallup’s annual poll of Americans’ confidence in their institutions, the most authoritative on the matter, found that as of June 2016, just 21 percent of Americans had a “great deal” or “quite a lot” of confidence in television news and only 20 percent in newspapers. Congress, by comparison, inspired confidence in just 9 percent. There is evidence that Congress’s approval rating is on the rise in Gallup’s polling, but there is not more recent data comparing the institutions. Mr. Trump went on to say that aside from a federal district judge’s decision to temporarily halt the ban, its rollout had been “perfect. ” By most measures, that is far from true. The order’s announcement and speedy implementation created chaos across the country and around the world. Travelers already in transit were stranded, protests erupted in the United States, and green card holders were initially blocked from   the country before being allowed back in. Several additional judges challenged various aspects of the measure. Even senior Republicans who agreed with the order’s goals said it had been “poorly implemented” and had sown confusion by being “overly broad. ”	1

130	Rachel L. Lindsay, a    lawyer from Texas, will be the first   lead on “The Bachelorette,” 14 years after the show, a spinoff of “The Bachelor,” debuted on television. The decision was announced Monday night on “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” Ms. Lindsay, a contestant on the current season of “The Bachelor,” appeared on the Kimmel show to accept a rose from the host. “I’m ready to find love, find a husband,” she said, adding that she was looking for a partner who was ready to start a family. Ms. Lindsay received a law degree from Marquette University in 2011 and is a personal injury lawyer at the Dallas firm Cooper  Scully. Mr. Kimmel’s show airs on ABC, the network that broadcasts “The Bachelor” and “The Bachelorette. ” In both shows  —   “The Bachelor” began in 2002 and “The Bachelorette” a year later  —   contestants vie for the affections of the lead. Neither show has had a black lead, though several   and women of Asian and Iranian ancestry have appeared as contestants. One Hispanic man has been the bachelor. As the seasons have worn on, news outlets, fans and public figures including Whoopi Goldberg have criticized the show for the omission. The blogger Stephen Carbone, who has been digging up “Bachelor” scoops on his website RealitySteve. com for more than a decade, first reported the news on Monday. The final episode of the current season of “Bachelor” is scheduled to air next month. As Mr. Kimmel pointed out, the announcement that Ms. Lindsay is setting out on a new quest for love suggests that the current season doesn’t end well for her  —   a possibility that Ms. Lindsay greeted with a shrug. “We’re ready to get this started,” Ms. Lindsay said of the new season, and the next quest: “If you know anybody out there who needs to apply, sign up, go ahead and get it started. ” Asked on “Good Morning America” on Tuesday if she felt pressure from the distinction of being the first black lead, she replied: “I don’t feel added pressure. ” “I’m honored to have this opportunity and to represent myself as an   woman and I just hope that people rally behind me like they did in Nick’s season,” she added, referring to Nick Viall, the current “Bachelor” lead. “Even though I’m an   woman, it’s not different from any other bachelorette. ” Mr. Viall, for his part, wrote on Instagram: “Saying goodbye to Rachel was one of the most heartbreaking moments of my life. I have met very few people who possess as much beauty, grace, and charisma as Rachel and after hearing that she’ll be the next Bachelorette I couldn’t be more excited. ”	1

129	Bobby Freeman, whose “Do You Want to Dance” climbed the pop charts in 1958 and endured long afterward in covers by the Beach Boys, the Ramones, Bette Midler and others, died on Jan. 23 at his home in Daly City, Calif. He was 76. The cause was a heart attack, his son Robert Freeman Jr. said on Monday. The death had not been widely reported. Mr. Freeman was still a teenager when he wrote and recorded the song that became his signature. Sung with infectious enthusiasm and featuring a driving Latin rhythm and a joyful guitar solo, “Do You Want to Dance” reached No. 5 on the Billboard singles chart. An energetic showman and dancer, Mr. Freeman was soon touring with Fats Domino and Jackie Wilson and appearing on television shows like “American Bandstand” and “The Dick Clark Saturday Night Beechnut Show. ” Mr. Freeman’s version of “Do You Want to Dance” (also known as “Do You Wanna Dance,” with and without the question mark) embodied the spirit of early rock ’n’ roll, but the secret to the song’s longevity was that artists interpreted it in myriad ways. The Beach Boys reached No. 12 on the Billboard chart in 1965 with a typically     interpretation. John Lennon recorded a dreamy reggae version. The Ramones ramped up Mr. Freeman’s energy to   levels.

171	WASHINGTON  —   The Justice Department told a federal appeals court on Thursday that it would not seek a rehearing of a decision that shut down President Trump’s targeted travel ban. Instead, the administration will start from scratch, issuing a new executive order, the department said. Last Thursday, a unanimous   panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco, blocked the key parts of the original executive order, which suspended the nation’s refugee program as well as travel from seven predominantly Muslim countries. The panel said the original ban was unlikely to survive constitutional scrutiny. The Justice Department said that the panel’s decision was riddled with errors but that the flaws it noted would be addressed in the new executive order. “Rather than continuing this litigation,” the Justice Department’s brief said, “the president intends in the near future to rescind the order and replace it with a new, substantially revised executive order to eliminate what the panel erroneously thought were constitutional concerns. ” “In so doing,” the brief said, “the president will clear the way for immediately protecting the country rather than pursuing further, potentially   litigation. ” In a news conference on Thursday, Mr. Trump said the new executive order would be issued next week. In its brief, the Justice Department urged the appeals court to await the new order and then vacate last Thursday’s decision. It is not clear that the issuance of a new and narrower executive order will make the case before the Ninth Circuit moot or that the court will agree to vacate the decision even if it did. The Supreme Court has said the “voluntary cessation” of a government action does not usually make a case moot if the government remains free to resume the conduct after the case is dismissed. In calling for a legal   the Justice Department avoided a Supreme Court test of the original executive order. A    tie on the   Supreme Court would have left the panel’s decision in place. Mr. Trump’s travel ban, issued Jan. 27, caused confusion and protests at airports nationwide and was immediately challenged in court. Many federal judges blocked aspects of the order. The broadest injunction was issued on Feb. 3 by Judge James L. Robart of the Federal District Court in Seattle, acting in a lawsuit filed by the states of Washington and Minnesota. Judge Robart required the administration to roll back the key aspects of the order, and travel from the affected countries resumed almost immediately. The next day, the Justice Department filed an emergency appeal, saying that national security concerns required immediate action from the appeals court. The   panel heard arguments a few days later, and in a unanimous decision last Thursday, it refused to reinstate the ban. Many legal scholars, including ones who disapproved of the ban, have criticized the reasoning in the panel’s ruling. The Justice Department’s brief tracked many of those critiques, saying the panel’s decision was plagued by misunderstandings about the scope of the original executive order and the president’s authority to address immigration. “In other circumstances,” the brief said, “the panel’s multiple errors in sustaining a substantially overbroad injunction, and thereby prohibiting enforcement of a lawful executive order designed to protect the nation’s security, would warrant” review by a larger panel of the Ninth Circuit. “Such review is not called for at this time,” the brief said, given the forthcoming executive order. In their own brief filed Thursday, Washington and Minnesota agreed with the administration on one thing: that no rehearing of the panel’s decision was warranted. But the states argued that the panel’s ruling had been careful and correct. “The panel’s order thoroughly considered the legal precedent and the parties’ arguments and neither overlooked nor misunderstood a point of law or fact,” the brief said. The briefs came in response to a request from the appeals court. Last Friday, an unidentified appeals court judge called for a vote on whether the   panel’s ruling should be reheard by a larger panel of the Ninth Circuit. If a majority of the court’s active judges vote to rehear the case, it would typically be considered by an   panel made up of the circuit’s chief judge and 10 judges chosen at random. Rehearing motions filed by parties and requests for votes on rehearings requested by judges are not particularly unusual. The Ninth Circuit rehears decisions issued by   panels 15 to 25 times a year, the court said. The Ninth Circuit has 25 active judges 18 were appointed by Democratic presidents. Even if the Ninth Circuit agrees to vacate the panel’s decision, challenges to the original executive order will continue in other courts. And the new executive order may draw fresh legal challenges.	1

945	 They took their game to North America in 2015, and I won’t belabor it here, but there was an exercise in Texas called Jade Helm 15 that Russian bots and the American alt-right media convinced most, many Texans was an Obama plan to round up political dissidents. And it got so much traction that the governor of Texas had to call out the National Guard to observe the federal exercise, to keep the population calm. At that point, I’m figuring the Russians are saying “We can go big time,” and at that point I think they made the decision ‘We’re going to play in the electoral process.” “This exercise is routine training to maintain a high level of readiness for Army Special Operations Forces because they must be ready to support potential missions anywhere in the world on a moment’s notice.”He said the only thing unique about this particular exercise, which is slated to take place between July 15 and Sept. 15, is “the use of new challenging terrain” which was chosen because it is similar to conditions special operations forces operate in overseas.  …I am horrified that I have to choose between the possibility that my Governor actually believes this stuff and the possibility that my Governor doesn’t have the backbone to stand up to those who do. Republican Gov. Greg Abbott was a Russian pawn and a useful idiot for Russian efforts to turn gullible Texas Republicans against the United States. Michael Hayden knows a Russian operation when he sees it. Hayden served the America people under three different administrations in high-profile intelligence roles.But, it doesn’t take an intelligence expert to see that Trump Republican Greg Abbott calling the Texas National Guard on the U.S. Military was downright idiocy. Abbott still owes the men and women of our armed forces, and every single Texan, an apology.	0

340	XOCHIMILCO, Mexico  —   With their   waters and blue herons, the canals and island farms of Xochimilco in southern Mexico City are all that remain of the extensive network of shimmering waterways that so awed Spanish invaders when they arrived here 500 years ago. But the fragility of this remnant of   life was revealed last month, when a    hole opened in the canal bed, draining water and alarming hundreds of tour boat operators and farmers who depend on the waterways for a living. The hole intensified a simmering conflict over nearby wells, which suck water from Xochimilco’s soil and pump it to other parts of Mexico City. It also revived worries about a process of decline, caused by pollution, urban encroachment and subsidence, that residents and experts fear may destroy the canals in a matter of years. “This is a warning,” said Sergio Raúl Rodríguez Elizarrarás, a geologist at the National Autonomous University of Mexico. “We are driving the canals towards their extinction. ” Xochimilco (pronounced   ) a municipality on the southeastern tip of Mexico City, is home to more than 6, 000 acres of protected wetlands, hemmed in by dense streets. Here, farmers grow rosemary, corn and chard on chinampas, islands formed using a technique dating from the Aztecs from willow trees, lilies and mud. Residents ply the area’s 100 or so miles of canals in canoes, much as they have for centuries. On weekends, thousands of tourists picnic and party on brightly painted barges, or trajineras. “This is the last thread that connects us to our   past,” Ricardo Munguía, an artist and tour guide, said recently while chugging through the dawn mist in a motorboat. As he slid past a field of broken corn stalks, a pelican swooped by and skidded on the water, slowing itself with its wide wings. “It would be heartbreaking to lose this,” Mr. Munguía said. As bucolic as the canals appear, intense exploitation of the area’s aquifers over the last 50 years has depleted springs, prompting the authorities to replenish the waterways from a nearby sewage treatment plant. As the earth dries out, it sinks, cracking buildings and forming sudden craters like the one that appeared on Jan. 24, 50 yards from a barge mooring. Boatmen at the mooring, known as the Embarcadero Zacapa, said they noticed the hole when a whirlpool appeared, like water running down a bath drain. By the time engineers had dammed off that part of the canal with sandbags several hours later, the water level had dropped about 10 inches. Since then, the 80 or so trajineras at Zacapa have mostly been idle, as tourists head to rival moorings, boatmen said  —   even though they can still reach the canals in one direction. On a recent Sunday, the boats were lined up like rows of gaudy shoes, but none had customers. “We’re kind of shocked,” said Ivan Montiel Olivares, 18, who has worked on the barges for 10 years. “If things turn bad, what will we do?” Juan Velazquez, a boatman in his 50s who was cleaning his deck, said that on the weekends he normally made about $15 a day, plus tips. The last two weekends he had made just $2. 50 each day. “Nature is making us pay for what we have done,” he said. Built on a silty lake bed, Mexico City has been sinking for centuries. The Metropolitan Cathedral became so tilted that engineers reinforced the foundations so that it would, at least, sink evenly. To slow the collapse in the city center, parts of which dropped about 26 feet during the last century, officials in the 1960s shifted water extraction from downtown to wells near Xochimilco, a decision experts called a “death sentence” for the canals. José Felipe García, Xochimilco’s director of civil defense, said that the canal should be back to normal by the end of February. Speaking by telephone, he said that the hole  —   which was filled this week  —   was a product of subsidence and geological faults beneath the area. But Dr. Rodríguez, the geologist, said it was part of a grim pattern of collapses in the area whose cause was “man made. ” Half a mile from the Zacapa mooring, a    crater opened in November, splitting a main road and trapping two small buses, residents said. Eduardo Sandoval, an architectural engineer who lives in the neighborhood, Santa María Nativitas, and leads an organization fighting for water rights, said the holes were a signal that problems were “accelerating. ” Water in Nativitas has been a source of endless tension, according to Mr. Sandoval, with 130 houses damaged by subsidence. Trucks fill up at the local well and sell water on the black market, but homes near the well can get water from their faucets for only a few hours a day. There are scattered government initiatives to increase the water supply, such as collecting rainwater in rooftop cisterns. But the feat of supplying the region’s 22 million people with water more than 7, 000 feet above sea level requires more creativity, experts said, like reusing dirty water. The water in Xochimilco’s canals is polluted. Treated water pumped into the canals from nearby Iztapalapa contains heavy metals, said María Guadalupe Figueroa, a biologist at the Autonomous Metropolitan University. Worse, she said, illegal dwellings on the chinampas dump raw sewage into the canals, affecting fish and crops. Today, much of the tilapia fished from the canals are used for cat food, and many farmers grow flowers rather than edible crops. Despite a ban on construction on the chinampas, more and more of the islands are being settled, experts and residents said, as   farming becomes less competitive and demand for residential space grows. Cables droop across smaller canals, supplying electricity to   houses that have no running water or sewers. Near one house, beer bottles stuck out of the mud, and a rusty bedspring served as a fence on the water’s edge. Juana Altamirano, who has lived for years in a plywood shack on what used to be a chinampa farmed by her father and grandparents, has outhouses with the Spanish words for “men” and “ladies” scrawled on the metal doors. The sewage, she said, “goes into the earth and doesn’t do any harm,” an improbable claim since she lives on an island of tangled roots and mud. Ms. Altamirano, 57, admits that the canal water is polluted. Her eldest grandchildren learned to swim in the canal, she said, but these days, the water gives swimmers a rash. “Still,” she said, “we breathe pure air. ” With every farmer who, like Ms. Altamirano’s father, stops cultivating the chinampas, “we lose a part of our identity,” said Félix Venancio, an activist trying to protect the chinampas and the communal land, or ejido, in San Gregorio, a district of Xochimilco. The knowledge of chinampa farming “goes from generation to generation,” Mr. Venancio said. “We’re losing that. ” Dr. Figueroa, the biologist, said that the authorities were working on a new plan for preserving the wetlands, pulling together academics, farmers, businesses and different branches of government. Xochimilco, which was designated a World Heritage site by the United Nations in 1987, has had no shortage of preservation plans over the years, but they remain   and funds “get lost along the way,” Dr. Figueroa said. “There’s a huge amount of corruption. ” She figures that, without a serious conservation effort, the canals will be gone in 10 to 15 years. But much of the damage was reversible, she said, adding: “It’s still a little paradise. ”	1

388	WASHINGTON  —   President Trump will instruct federal agencies on Monday to assemble a budget for the coming fiscal year that includes sharp increases in Defense Department spending and drastic enough cuts to domestic agencies that he can keep his promise to leave Social Security and Medicare alone, according to four senior administration officials. The budget outline will be the first move in a campaign this week to reset the narrative of Mr. Trump’s   White House. A day before delivering a   address on Tuesday to a joint session of Congress, Mr. Trump will demand a budget with tens of billions of dollars in reductions to the Environmental Protection Agency and State Department, according to four senior administration officials with direct knowledge of the plan. Social safety net programs, aside from the big entitlement programs for retirees, would also be hit hard. Preliminary budget outlines are usually   administrative exercises, the first step in negotiations between the White House and federal agencies that usually shave the sharpest edges off the initial request. But this plan  —   a product of a collaboration between the Office of Management and Budget director, Mick Mulvaney the National Economic Council director, Gary Cohn and the White House chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon  —   is intended to make a big splash for a president eager to show that he is a man of action. Mr. Trump’s top advisers huddled in the White House this weekend to work on his Tuesday night   address. They focused on a single, often overlooked message amid the chaos of his first weeks in the White House: the assertion that the   candidate is now a president determined to keep audacious campaign promises on immigration, the economy and the budget, no matter how sloppy or disruptive it looks from the outside. “They might not agree with everything you do, but people will respect you for doing what you said you were going to do,” said Jason Miller, a top communications strategist on the Trump campaign who remains close to the White House. “He’s doing something first, and there’s time for talk later,” Mr. Miller added. “This is ultimately how he’s going to get people who didn’t vote, or people who didn’t vote for him, into the fold. Inside the Beltway and with the media, there’s this focus on the palace intrigue. Out in the rest of the country, they are seeing a guy who is focused on jobs and the economy. ” The budget plan, a numerical sketch that will probably be substantially altered by House and Senate Republicans  —   and vociferously opposed by congressional Democrats  —   will be Mr. Trump’s first big step into a legislative fray he has largely avoided during the first 40 days of his administration. Thus far, instead of legislating, he has focused on a succession of executive orders on immigration and deregulation written by Mr. Bannon’s small West Wing team. Resistance from federal agencies could ease some of the deepest cuts in the initial plan before a final budget request is even sent to Congress. And Capitol Hill will have the last word. To meet Mr. Trump’s defense request, lawmakers in both parties would have to agree to raise or end statutory spending caps on defense and domestic programs that were imposed by the 2011 Budget Control Act. Mr. Trump is in a highly unusual position at a time when most presidents are finding their footing or confronting crisis. Despite his lament that he was handed “a mess” by President Barack Obama, Mr. Trump inherited a low unemployment rate, a lack of international crises requiring immediate attention and majorities in both houses of Congress. By contrast, when Mr. Obama took office, the country was losing 700, 000 jobs a month, and the global financial system was teetering on the edge of collapse. By the time he stepped up to the rostrum for his first joint congressional address on Feb. 24, 2009, he had already accrued an impressive string of accomplishments, including the passage of a massive stimulus bill through the   Congress, a gender   act, a children’s health insurance law and executive actions that would ultimately help stabilize the financial and automotive sectors. With the prospect of a second Great Depression still high, Mr. Obama sought to rally the country, vowing, “We will rebuild, we will recover, and the United States of America will emerge stronger than before. ” Mayor Rahm Emanuel of Chicago, who was Mr. Obama’s first chief of staff, said in an interview Sunday night that Mr. Trump was trying to create a “sense of urgency, which most people aren’t feeling right now, which was a reality to us” in order to generate support for his unspecified economic agenda, including an infrastructure bill and a tax overhaul. “When it comes to all of these executive orders, the question is, does the public view what he’s doing as action or motion?” Mr. Emanuel added. “If you don’t have real action, you create a sense of motion, so the public views it as progress. ” In putting together their budget plans, White House officials are operating under the assumption that the rate of the United States’ economic growth this year will be 2. 4 percent, according to one person who has been briefed on the matter. That is slightly ahead of current projections, but it is well below the 3 percent to 4 percent growth that Mr. Trump promised during the campaign. For next year, the operating assumption is only slightly higher, that person added, a sign that the budget process will not be too out of step with economic reality. The turmoil that has engulfed Mr. Trump’s West Wing is largely of his own devising  —   part of a calculated effort by Mr. Bannon to move boldly despite his team’s lack of experience, and despite the reluctance of many mainstream Republicans to work for a president whom many of them opposed in the party’s brutal primaries. “During his first month in office, President Trump has done exactly what he said he was going to do,” said Thomas Barrack Jr. a longtime friend of Mr. Trump’s who ran his inaugural committee. “No president has worked harder or accomplished as much, even with tremendous political resistance forcing him to operate with a small team of outsiders possessing little government experience. ” Lawmakers in both parties have complained that the president’s big words are not yet matched by detailed policy prescriptions or a legislative affairs team capable of executing such undefined promises as repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act or rewriting the tax code. The budget outline will give Mr. Trump an opportunity to add some specifics to an agenda that has been defined by bellicose speech and the broadest possible policy strokes. Still, aides said Mr. Trump did not plan to change his style for Tuesday’s address. The speech, they said, is likely to have more in common with his clipped inaugural address  —   in which he declared, “The time for empty talk is over”  —   than the   litanies of policy proposals favored by President Bill Clinton or the   invocations of national purpose preferred by President George W. Bush and Mr. Obama. Mr. Trump’s team, conscious of his recent reversals and a   approval rating that is among the lowest ever recorded, has emphasized his determination to break the partisan gridlock and inaction that has kept congressional approval ratings in the 15 to 30 percent range for years. At the start of an interview last week with Sean Hannity of Fox News at the Conservative Political Action Conference, Kellyanne Conway, the president’s counselor, called him “President Action, President Impact, Donald J. Trump. ” In a   of Sunday show interviews, Stephen Miller, Mr. Trump’s policy adviser, maintained that the president had accomplished more in his first month than most of his predecessors had in their entire administrations. In reality, most of Mr. Trump’s executive actions have had no more effect on actual policy than news releases. And his     order on the   Partnership trade deal came well after the agreement had been put on life support by labor protests and liberal opposition. One West Wing official, who requested anonymity to speak candidly about strategy, said the administration craved the   television images of Mr. Trump at   discussions with business executives every few days on one side, and the vehement protesters of his administration on the other. But his critics say such photo opportunities are all an act, a      rendition of “The Apprentice” by an ineffective rookie president. “This man is not a doer,” said Representative Nancy Pelosi, the House minority leader, who will host a Monday “ ” of Mr. Trump’s Tuesday speech. “Oh, please. He has nothing to show for what he’s been doing in office for 40 days. It’s all been squandered. ”	1

69	WASHINGTON  —   Staff members on Capitol Hill recall Stephen Miller, the    White House adviser behind many of President Trump’s most contentious executive orders, as the guy from Jeff Sessions’s office who made their inboxes cry for mercy. As a top aide to Mr. Sessions, the conservative Alabama senator, Mr. Miller dispatched dozens and dozens of bombastic emails to congressional staff members and reporters in early 2013 when the Senate was considering a big bipartisan immigration overhaul. Mr. Miller slammed the evils of “foreign labor” and pushed around nasty news articles on proponents of compromise, like Senator Marco Rubio of Florida. One exhausted Senate staff member, forwarding a   to a reporter at the time, wrote: “His latest. And it’s only 11:45 a. m. ” The ascent of Mr. Miller from   gadfly with little policy experience to the president’s senior policy adviser came as a shock to many of the staff members who knew him from his seven years in the Senate. A man whose emails were, until recently, considered spam by many of his Republican peers is now shaping the Trump administration’s core domestic policies with his economic nationalism and   positions on immigration. But his unlikely rise is emblematic of a White House where unconventional résumés rule  —   where the chief strategist is Stephen K. Bannon, until recently the head of the     website Breitbart News, and the president himself is a former reality television star who before winning the nation’s highest office had never shown much interest in the arcana of governing. Yet all three men are bound by a belief in an   economic policy that has suddenly moved from the fringes of American politics to the Oval Office. “Stephen was the kind of guy who would make a passionate ideological argument to a roomful of people who were there to make pragmatic decisions,” said Alex Conant, a former aide to Mr. Rubio who remembers squaring off against Mr. Miller at a routine Republican messaging meeting that turned into a   immigration debate. Mr. Miller has been at the epicenter of some of the administration’s most provocative moves, from pushing hard for the construction of a wall along the border with Mexico to threatening   trade deals at the heart of Republican economic orthodoxy, to rolling out Mr. Trump’s travel ban on seven largely Muslim nations, whose bungled introduction he oversaw. Working in an administration that “didn’t come here to do small things,” as Mr. Bannon has put it, is a role that Mr. Miller  —   universally known as a tireless worker  —   has been preparing for much of his life. From his days at a public high school in Southern California, where he preached against “political correctness” and liberalism and called in to conservative radio shows, to his time at Duke University, where he was known for controversial writings in the student newspaper and a failed attempt at a run for dorm president, he has delighted in challenging prevailing orthodoxies. At a freshman mixer, recalled a college classmate who spoke on the condition of anonymity, Mr. Miller announced, “My name is Stephen Miller, I am from Los Angeles, and I like guns. ” Mr. Miller, known for his skinny ties,   ’  pants and his recently abandoned   habit, enjoyed a relatively   ascent in Mr. Trump’s orbit until the travel ban. His eagerness to keep a tight lid on key details of executive orders to prevent leaks  —   as well as his inexperience  —   has at times hampered coordination between the West Wing and agencies that would have to carry them out, several White House officials said. In part to deal with the confusion that surrounded the travel ban, Reince Priebus, the White House chief of staff, recently created a   protocol that requires all major executive actions to be cleared with the communications department and other senior White House staff members before implementation. But Mr. Miller’s peacock confidence has served him well with Mr. Trump, who first got to know him in 2015, when Mr. Miller helped bring Mr. Sessions, now the attorney general, into the Trump fold. After the Republican National Convention in July, Mr. Miller became Mr. Trump’s principal    speechwriter once the candidate had switched from handwritten notes to a teleprompter in the middle of the campaign. The message in those speeches was so reflective of Mr. Trump’s views that it earned Mr. Miller a spot as the   act for Mr. Trump’s campaign rallies. His words became Mr. Trump’s  —   “We’re going to build that wall, and we’re going to build it out of love,” Mr. Miller often said. “Steve is a true believer in every sense of the word, not just in this message of economic populism but in President Trump as a leader,” said Jason Miller, who worked with him in the Trump campaign and is not related. “Steve’s fiercely loyal and has a better understanding of the president’s vision than almost anyone. ” It is sometimes hard to tell Mr. Trump’s voice from that of Mr. Miller, who suppressed his own orotund speech to capture the president’s more visceral,    style. Not that he has had much choice: As one of three or four staff members to fly around with Mr. Trump during the last few months of the campaign, Mr. Miller was summoned to speechwriting tasks by a bark of “Ready!” from Mr. Trump, who insisted on dictating practically every word  —   and laced into staff members who changed a word or inserted an overly complex policy point. Mr. Miller’s flexibility as a speechwriter is offset by the consistent stridency of his political philosophy, which has remained much the same since he was the distinct minority at Santa Monica High School, a liberal outpost where he often railed against fellow students and the school administration. Mexican heritage celebrations and Iraq war protests were things of particular offense. He produced a 2003 essay, “How I Changed My Left Wing High School,” that capped a high school career steeped in political activism. At Duke, Mr. Miller, who is Jewish, cut a similarly confrontational swath, and was briefly friendly with Richard Spencer, who later became a prominent white supremacist, when both were members of the university’s Young Conservatives chapter. From there, it was straight to Capitol Hill, where Mr. Miller worked for Representatives Michele Bachmann of Minnesota and John Shadegg of Arizona before ending up with Mr. Sessions in 2009. Mr. Sessions and Mr. Miller worked tirelessly against the   congressional effort at an immigration overhaul. The bill passed the Senate easily in spite of Mr. Sessions’s vociferous objections, but failed in the House. “We knew we were taking on the establishment, and Steve was an incredibly hard worker and had no second thoughts about it,” Mr. Sessions said in an interview. Mr. Miller wrote many of the incendiary speeches that Mr. Sessions gave about the bill, including one in which he suggested that a   aide to Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York, had been the author of a measure that he believed to be “amnesty” in disguise. Ultimately, it was Mr. Miller’s dour views on illegal immigration that endeared him to Mr. Bannon and a small team of   economic nationalists that included Julia Hahn, a former Breitbart writer. The group came together during the 2014 campaign of the   Republican candidate Dave Brat, whose upset win over the House majority leader, Eric Cantor, in a suburban Richmond, Va. district augured Mr. Trump’s success. Even then, Mr. Miller had his eye on Mr. Trump, who had flirted with a run for president in 2012. Soon after Mr. Brat’s victory in the Republican primary in July 2014, Mr. Miller sent his friends a Breitbart interview in which Mr. Trump declared, “Everybody is vulnerable because what’s happening in the country is very sad, and the world is watching. ” Mr. Miller added a comment: “Trump gets it. I wish he’d run for president. ” Mr. Bannon, Mr. Miller and the   head of the Domestic Policy Council, Andrew Bremberg, spent the later part of the transition period mapping out a    protocol of executive orders, sending more than 200 to federal agencies for review. The trouble came when they sent some of them to   officials at federal agencies for review, leading to leaks that prompted Mr. Miller to restrict the circulation of the plans. Mr. Trump, initially pleased by the bold series of executive actions orchestrated by the team, was stung by the fallout from Mr. Miller’s execution of the immigration order, and expressed frustration about not being fully briefed on an order reorganizing the National Security Council to give Mr. Bannon additional power. Despite the internal   Mr. Miller remains close to the   Mr. Bannon, who described him in an email as “a loyal and faithful soldier in the Trump movement, a warrior for the working class. ” In recent days, Mr. Miller has been working on what is expected to be another contentious order: an    rewriting of the guest worker program that is likely to impose new restrictions on the cheap foreign labor that Mr. Miller deplored in many of his 2013 emails, according to two officials familiar with their planning. Mr. Miller, one of the officials said, is working closely with Department of Homeland Security aides to avoid a repeat of the travel ban fiasco.	1
436	Cancers of the colon and rectum have been declining in older adults in recent decades and have always been considered rare in young people. But scientists are reporting a sharp rise in colorectal cancers in adults as young as their 20s and 30s, an ominous trend. The vast majority of colorectal cancers are still found in older people, with nearly 90 percent of all cases diagnosed in people over 50. But a new study from the American Cancer Society that analyzed cancer incidence by birth year found that colorectal cancer rates, which had dropped steadily for people born between 1890 and 1950, have been increasing for every generation born since 1950. Experts aren’t sure why. Rectal cancers are rising particularly sharply, far faster than cancers in other parts of the large intestine or colon. The American Cancer Society estimates about 13, 500 new cases of colon and rectal cancers will be diagnosed in Americans under 50 this year, with more than 95, 500 cases of colon cancer and nearly 40, 000 cases of rectal cancer in all age groups. “People born in 1990, like my son, have double the risk of colon cancer and quadruple the risk of rectal cancer” compared to the risk someone born in 1950 faced at a comparable age, said Rebecca Siegel, an epidemiologist with the American Cancer Society and the lead author of the new report, published in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute on Tuesday. And though the absolute risk is still small in younger people, she said, “They carry the risk forward with them as they age. ” It is the upward trend that is worrisome: The risk of colon cancer for individuals who were born in 1990 was five per million people in that birth group, up from three per million at the same stage of life for those born in 1950. And the risk of rectal cancer for those born in 1990 was four per million, up from 0. 9 per million for those born in 1950. Dr. Thomas Weber, a professor of surgery at SUNY Downstate Medical Center who has served on the National Colorectal Cancer Roundtable and who was not involved in the new study, said the latest research confirms the problem is real and increasing. “There is no mistaking these dramatic increases, especially for rectal cancers,” he said, noting that the number of new colorectal cancers among people under 50 each year exceeds the total number of new cases of less common cancers like Hodgkin’s lymphoma. Young people with colorectal cancer run the added risk of getting a diagnosis later in the course of their disease, when the cancer may be less treatable, because doctors typically don’t consider the diagnosis at such a young age. Kirsten Freiborg, who is now 27, complained to doctors repeatedly about having blood in her stool when she was in college, but was told she had internal hemorrhoids. She was finally given a diagnosis of advanced colon cancer a month before her graduation, when she was 22. Ms. Freiborg’s mother, a registered nurse, “kept pushing” for more testing, Ms. Freiborg said, and eventually convinced physicians to send her for a procedure called a flexible sigmoidoscopy, which detected a large tumor in Ms. Freiborg’s colon. “I still remember getting the phone call from the doctor who did the procedure, who was completely shocked, and said ‘I would never have guessed that a    would have had cancer,’” said Ms. Freiborg, who was treated with surgery and chemotherapy and is now  . Most colorectal cancers are considered a disease of aging, so any increase in young adults, especially when rates of the disease are on the wane in older people, is both baffling and worrisome, experts say. Colorectal cancer rates have declined over all in recent years thanks to widespread use of screening tests like colonoscopies, which can detect precancerous polyps that can be removed before cancer develops. These screening tests have not been considered practical for a younger population, and while other less invasive screening tests exist, doctors are hoping improved methods that will be easier to administer will be developed. Experts also attribute lowering cancer rates to changes in risk factors, particularly lifestyle changes like smoking cessation and healthier diets. Diets that include more fruits, vegetables and fiber and less red and processed meat are linked to lower colorectal cancer risk. Obesity and sedentary lifestyles are also associated with colorectal cancer, as are heavy alcohol use and chronic conditions like inflammatory bowel disease and Type 2 diabetes, all of which are on the rise. But experts are not entirely convinced these are the only reasons colorectal cancer is increasing among young people. While rates of cancers tied to human papillomavirus, or HPV, have been rising in recent years, that virus causes mainly cancers of the cervix, anus or the back of the throat, and only a small number of cases of rectal cancer. “The honest truth is nobody knows 100 percent why there is an increase,” said Dr. Mohamed E. Salem, an assistant professor at Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center at Georgetown University. He said that he is older than about 60 percent of his patients  —   and he is 42. “It’s hard to blame it on obesity alone. We suspect there is also something else going on. ” Dr. Jason A. Zell, an associate professor of oncology at the University of California, Irvine, who did a study in 2014 that found increasing rates of colorectal cancer among adults ages 20 to 39 in California, said the big challenge is how to shape health policy. “By now we know the rates are going up, it’s been reported several times,” Dr. Zell said. “Now the question is, what do we do?” The latest analysis is the largest and most detailed to date, looking at large cancer registries reporting on nearly half a million cases dating back to 1974 to assess rates by   age groups and birth cohorts. It found that in adults ages 20 to 39, colon cancer rates have increased by 1 percent to 2. 4 percent a year since the   while rates declined over all among those 55 and older. Rates among adults 40 to 54 increased by 0. 5 percent to 1. 3 percent a year since the  . Rectal cancer incidence rates among adults in their 20s increased even more sharply, rising by 3. 2 percent a year from 1974 to 2013. And while rectal cancer rates have declined over all among people 55 and older since 1974, rates in people 50 to 54 increased between   and  . By   nearly 30 percent of all rectal cancers were being diagnosed in people under age 55, compared with 15 percent of all rectal cancers being found in this age group in   the study reported. Many patients are so young at the time of diagnosis that they have not been screened by colonoscopy, which is recommended beginning at age 50 for people who are at average risk. The risk is higher among   and the American College of Gastroenterology recommends they start screening at 45. Those with colorectal cancer may experience warning signs, but the symptoms are typically vague, including general digestive complaints like diarrhea or constipation, cramping and abdominal pain. Tara Anderson, a    mother of four from Bowie, Md. had chronic constipation for years before seeking help at a   emergency room clinic in 2015 because she was in so much pain. There, a scan detected a tumor in her colon “the size of a tennis ball,” she said. A gastroenterologist who examined her a year earlier merely told her to increase her intake of dietary fiber to ease her constipation, she said. Fortunately, she said, her disease had not spread. For Chris Roberts, who was 29 when he found out he had colon cancer, the first symptoms were weight loss and loss of appetite. “I lost about 20 pounds and I wasn’t really trying to lose weight, but I just didn’t enjoy eating,” said Mr. Roberts, now 30. He had just moved to New York City and did not have a regular doctor, but was fortunate enough to find a doctor who was determined to make a diagnosis quickly and ordered several blood tests and an ultrasound scan that found tumors that had already spread to Mr. Roberts’s liver. He has been treated with chemotherapy and had surgery in January to remove parts of his colon and liver. “I definitely want to get the word out: If you have symptoms that may be linked to cancer, colorectal cancer or any kind, get it checked out,” he said.	1

332	When Nathan Kecy graduated from Plymouth State University in New Hampshire a decade ago with a bachelor’s degree in communications, he found himself with about $10, 000 in debt and few clear career options. He first found work as a    salesman (“a pyramid scheme,” he recalls) and then in telemarketing. Finally he landed a job as an infrastructure specialist for Datamatic, a      company. He was traveling across the country installing meters, making a decent salary. But he lost his job after the company restructured in 2012, he said, and soon he found that his skills weren’t easily transferable to a new field Datamatic’s technology was proprietary, and his expertise in the company’s installation program wasn’t appealing to employers outside that particular industry. He tried going into business with a friend, but the relationship soured. By then he had a baby and a fiancée, and he felt stuck. Now 32, Kecy is a few months away from finishing a   certificate program in advanced composites manufacturing at Great Bay Community College in Rochester, N. H. The program operates out of a satellite campus that opened in 2013, with aid from a Labor Department grant meant to help community colleges reach “trade displaced” workers who need help training for new careers. The unemployment rate in southern New Hampshire is low, less than 3 percent. At one state job fair last summer, just 350 people showed up for 1, 200 available jobs. In Strafford County, where Rochester is located, the largest employers include the University of New Hampshire and Liberty Mutual, but also manufacturers like Turbocam and Contitech. Kecy’s classmates include veterans, recent   graduates and older workers whose careers had reached dead ends. All of them are looking for hope and a decent paycheck by acquiring a new set of skills. “Within six months, I’m going to go from regular guy to working in the aerospace community,” says Tommy Florentino, a disabled veteran with a background in construction and automotive manufacturing. He has friends who went to Boston College or Suffolk University, “and they’re waiters and waitresses. ” The college’s    Advanced Technology and Academic Center is at the edge of a nondescript shopping center. The complex also houses a Dollar Tree, a J. C. Penney and a Kmart, where a banner out front reads, “Now hiring. ” Cashiers there earn close to minimum wage. But Kecy expects to earn at least $16 an hour when he graduates and to move up quickly from there. Composites is a broad field in manufacturing, with applications including automotive parts, sporting goods and prosthetics, as well as in the locally prominent aerospace industry. The state’s department of economic development bills its seacoast region as “the emerging composites region,” and it points to Great Bay’s program as a reason for more aerospace and defense businesses in particular to relocate there. “I’ve got some options, which is something I’ve never really experienced before,” Kecy says. There’s a strange disconnect between two of the big narratives about the American   work force right now. In one story, there is a population of unemployed and underemployed   adults for whom   work seems increasingly out of reach their jobs have gone overseas or become automated, and they find themselves working retail, or not working at all. But an apparently conflicting story comes from American employers, which have been insisting for years that they have a hard time finding workers to fill many skilled   jobs. A 2015 report from the Manufacturing Institute, for example, found that seven in 10 manufacturing executives said they faced shortages of workers with adequate tech skills. A high proportion of existing skilled workers is also nearing retirement, which means a bigger gap is looming soon. By 2025, the report warned, two million jobs will be going unfilled. (Health care, also a big focus of retraining programs, is another rapidly expanding field.) The tantalizing promise of   job training is that it can bridge the gap between those narratives in a way that benefits individual workers, employers and the country as a whole.   Americans get good jobs, employers get skilled labor and the economy benefits from their mutual good fortune. The image of that virtuous cycle has made the promotion of training programs appealing for politicians on the left and the right. Hillary Clinton proposed retraining former   workers in new careers as part of a $30 billion package meant “to ensure that coal miners and their families get the benefits they’ve earned and respect they deserve. ” Even as Republicans have voted to cut funding for training in recent years, they have paid it lip service as a way to put Americans back to work. It’s perhaps not surprising, though, that so much of the working class gravitated in the last election to Donald Trump, whose rhetoric about displaced workers was very different: blunt (if unrealistic) promises to stop old careers from disappearing, to “bring back our jobs. ” In its zeal for retraining, the federal government’s approach to the problem has become increasingly byzantine, a dizzying constellation of programs to help struggling workers prepare for new careers. Some of them are intended for employees laid off en masse when their jobs went overseas, and others are for those who are simply unemployed and underqualified for   work. In the 2009 fiscal year, the Government Accountability Office counted 47 different federal   programs administered by nine agencies, numbers Republicans have since used to argue that many of the programs were redundant. In his 2012 State of the Union address, even President Obama criticized the “maze of confusing training programs” unemployed workers had to navigate to get help. The Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act, signed into law in 2014 with bipartisan support, was designed in part to streamline the government’s approach. Critics also say that job training is costly and too often ineffective. Take the primary federal effort specifically aimed at workers affected by global trade, the Labor Department’s Trade Adjustment Assistance program. Through T. A. A. qualified workers can receive free retraining, typically through a   program like Great Bay’s. The program is generous, spending more than $11, 500 on each person who participated in retraining in the 2015 fiscal year. But it serves relatively few people, and recent analysis has shown iffy results: A 2012 evaluation prepared for the Labor Department found that while 85 percent of those who went through T. A. A.  training eventually received a certificate or degree, only 37 percent of them were working in that field four years later. (The program was later amended to include more individualized support.) All too often, skeptics say, publicly funded training programs are a sop to   companies who want taxpayers to foot the bill to train their workers. Critics also point at research suggesting that    training by employers themselves has been declining in recent years. But it simply doesn’t make economic sense for most employers to do all of their own training anymore. In part, this is because of technology: Jobs in advanced manufacturing and health care require intense technological instruction, usually accompanied by classroom time. At the same time, standardization means employers often poach skilled workers from one another, which discourages them from investing a lot of time and money in training their own workers. “It’s unrealistic today to think of traditional, very idiosyncratic manufacturing jobs where you’re going to walk in, get a job, get trained in a bunch of very specific skills, and they’ll hold onto you for decades,” says Lawrence Katz, an economist at Harvard University. “That’s just not the trajectory of employment anymore. ” After completing the certificate program in April, Kecy will have specializations in “nondestructive testing” and “bonding and finishing,” skills that set him up for specific positions that local employers have been struggling to fill. The simplest description of composites manufacturing is that it is the process of putting two materials together adobe, for example, is a composite of straw and mud. “Advanced” composites manufacturing typically involves adding   resin to woven fibers. The strong, lightweight finished products are replacing metal in many manufacturing areas, including aerospace. Great Bay students further specialize in areas like quality inspection or   molding the goal is that when they graduate, they are ready for     jobs. Advanced manufacturing in general is a strong industry in New England a recent analysis by Deloitte and the New England Council found that in 2012, 59 percent of the region’s 641, 000 manufacturing jobs were “advanced. ” With his certificate, Kecy is confident that he will find a job locally, and he’s probably right. Great Bay’s composites program was developed in a close relationship with Safran Aerospace Composites and Albany Engineered Composites, two companies that opened a shared plant in Rochester in 2014. Safran helped develop the program’s curriculum and stays in touch about which specializations the company will be needing in the coming months. It guarantees interviews to all graduates of the program and has hired about 30 of the more than 170 participants so far. Over all, more than half the program’s graduates have been hired by five large local manufacturers, according to its director, Debra Mattson. That level of coordination with local industry, ideally touching on everything from curriculum to recruitment, is now seen by policy experts as a crucial dividing line between programs that work and those that don’t. The federal government now emphasizes this kind of “demand driven” training in part to ensure that workers aren’t being retrained with new skills as obsolete as their old ones. “A good sign is if the program was   with the firm,” says Mark Muro, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution’s Metropolitan Policy Program. “One of the fundamental problems is training divorced from   dynamics  —   people being trained without the presence of jobs they could actually arrive in. ” (The Nordic countries, which spend more on job training in general, have a strong record in developing training with input from both industry and labor.) The evidence in the United States for   training is promising so far. A 2010 study of three such programs found that enrollees were earning almost 30 percent more than a control group two years after they began the program and were significantly more likely to be employed. The Great Bay program has relationships with Safran, A. E. C. and other area employers, including BAE Systems, Turbocam International and the gun manufacturer Sig Sauer, which recently landed a $580 million contract with the Army. The program is short by design, and new cohorts start three times a year to ensure a steady stream of graduates for local employers. “Industry is dying for bodies, just dying for skilled workers,” says Will Arvelo, Great Bay’s president. “They can’t wait two years. ” On a snowy afternoon a few weeks ago, Kecy and his classmates in his Fundamentals of Composites Manufacturing class were at work in the “clean room. ” The setting looked more like a science lab than a factory. A large cooler stacked with   bags of thick fabric pieces stood in the corner, and work tables held clusters of metal tubes. The class instructor, Peter Dow, watched as two teams of students worked on a project they had been planning for several weeks: constructing a     tube with a finished exterior. Later they would have a chance to tweak their plans and try it all over again, a lesson in the manufacturing principle of “continuous improvement. ” For all the ways in which technology has changed the manufacturing industry, one of the most striking to an outsider is the appearance of the work space itself. The students in the clean room wore white coats and safety glasses as they used hair dryers and refrigerant spray to fiddle with the sticky material. Outside their small work area, the facility’s spotless manufacturing lab offered the capacity to build a product from start to finish: a huge,   loom for weaving carbon fiber, a   machining center, an automatic autoclave. Practically every piece of equipment seemed to feature a keyboard or touch screen. But manufacturing’s new     profile is also what makes it daunting for many older workers looking for new careers. The dilemma illustrates some of the broader challenges of retraining later in life. Kerri Uyeno, a    single mother of three who graduated in the Great Bay program’s first cohort in 2014, began working at Safran as a bonding operator three weeks after earning her certificate. It was such a happy ending that she featured prominently in early publicity materials for the program. But she had conflicts with her supervisors and lasted just over a year in the job before quitting. She didn’t work again for six months her house went into foreclosure. An administrator at Great Bay tried to persuade her to come back and work toward her associate degree, but the prospect was exhausting. “It was so hard to get through that six months to my certificate,” she said, “I just didn’t have it in me to get more schooling. ” Today she is an office manager at a flooring showroom nearby. She still exudes pride when she talks about earning her certificate, but she also calls the experience “one of the biggest heartbreaks I’ve ever gone through. ” At 49, Dean Kandilakis is one of the oldest students in the program’s current cohort. He has a master’s degree in international relations, but he spent most of his career doing administrative work. “There’s a really large learning curve for someone who’s just   from a different field,” he said during a break from class. “It’s been a very stressful time for me, because it’s an adjustment in my identity as a human being. ” But he says it’s worth it to feel as if he’s finally becoming a specialist in something. It can take enormous intellectual and emotional efforts to pursue retraining, especially for people who have been rattled by sudden job loss or depressed by declining career prospects. For all his grandiosity, Donald Trump’s approach to   voters was characterized by relentless pessimism: dark visions of “poverty and heartache,” warnings about Mexicans “taking our manufacturing jobs. ” Nostalgia, with its disdain for the present and mistrust of the future, is actually quite a gloomy sentiment. Job training, by contrast, makes the    assurance that starting over is possible with help and time. It takes optimism on the part of both policy makers and workers. Back in the lab, Kandilakis’s team had been having some difficulty with their tube the material was too warm, and it was thickening too quickly as they molded it. “We’re having some problems today,” he said, but he didn’t sound concerned. “Thankfully we’ll have another run. ”	1

142	WASHINGTON  —   The resignation of Michael T. Flynn as national security adviser caps a remarkably tumultuous first month for President Trump’s White House that has burdened the early days of his presidency with scandal, legal challenges, personnel drama and questions about his temperament during interactions with world leaders. Mr. Flynn, a retired Army lieutenant general, lasted only 24 days before his tenure was cut short by an admission that he had misled the vice president and other White House colleagues about the contents of a phone call with the Russian ambassador to the United States. The resignation on Monday night and the continuing turmoil inside the National Security Council have deeply rattled the Washington establishment. Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, railed against the administration on Tuesday, decrying the “dysfunction” of the country’s national security apparatus and accusing the White House of being a place where “nobody knows who’s in charge and nobody knows who’s setting policy. ” Gen. Tony Thomas, head of the military’s Special Operations Command, expressed concern about upheaval inside the White House. “Our government continues to be in unbelievable turmoil. I hope they sort it out soon because we’re a nation at war,” he said at a military conference on Tuesday. Asked about his comments later, General Thomas said in a brief interview, “As a commander, I’m concerned our government be as stable as possible. ” But Mr. Flynn’s   departure just added to the broader sense of chaos at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. In record time, the 45th president has set off global outrage with a ban on travelers from   countries, fired his acting attorney general for refusing to defend the ban and watched as federal courts swiftly moved to block the policy, calling it an unconstitutional use of executive power. The president angrily provoked the cancellation of a summit meeting with the Mexican president, hung up on Australia’s prime minister, authorized a commando raid that resulted in the death of a Navy SEAL member, repeatedly lied about the existence of millions of fraudulent votes cast in the 2016 election and engaged in Twitter wars with senators, a sports team owner, a Hollywood actor and a major department store chain. His words and actions have generated almost daily protests around the country. “I’ve never been so nervous in my lifetime about what may or may not happen in Washington,” said Leon Panetta, a Democrat who served as chief of staff, secretary of defense and C. I. A. director during a   career that spanned nine presidents from both parties. “I don’t know whether this White House is capable of responding in a thoughtful or careful way should a crisis erupt,” he said in an interview on Tuesday. “You can do    stuff over a period of time. But at some point, I don’t give a damn what your particular sense of change is all about, you cannot afford to have change become chaos. ” Mr. Trump’s allies note that the president has moved forward in areas that are more typical of the early days of a   administration. Mr. Trump nominated a Supreme Court justice 12 days into his tenure, and has issued a dozen executive orders, including ones to limit the influence of lobbyists, reduce regulations, pare the Affordable Care Act, move forward on pipeline construction, end trade deals and speed up deportations. Those accomplishments are catnip for the president’s most fervent supporters across the country, said Sara Fagen, who served as a senior aide and political director for former President George W. Bush. The perspective on the White House is very different far outside the interstate freeway that rings Washington, she said.’ ”“If you’re someone inside the Beltway, you think it’s been really rocky,” she said. “If you are outside the Beltway, you think, ‘That’s why we sent him there.’ There has been a lot of chaos and a lot of growing pains, but they have gotten a lot done. ”” ’Still, half of the president’s cabinet has yet to be confirmed by the   Senate, and several other key White House aides have become lightning rods for daily mockery by   comedians. It all has official Washington reeling and exhausted as it tries to make sense of  —   and keep up with  —   the nearly constant tornado of activity swirling around the president and his advisers. “If you had   Obama, you’ve got      Trump,” said John Feehery, a veteran Republican strategist, who compared the last several weeks to the chaotic start to Newt Gingrich’s tenure as speaker of the House in 1995. “Newt never settled down. It was always one crisis after another,” Mr. Feehery recalled. “This might be the new normal. People will start getting used to the new normal, but will also be exhausted by it. ” As a candidate, Mr. Trump promised to move quickly to stop illegal immigration, bring jobs back, end trade deals and reduce crime. Central to his campaign agenda was his pledge to be a disruptive force in Washington  —   and he has certainly done that. Since winning the election, Mr. Trump and his closest aides have embraced the turmoil, viewing it as evidence of their aggressive efforts to fundamentally reorient the government. The West Wing also uses the chaos as a tactical weapon, believing that the flurry of   presidential tweets, controversial statements during the afternoon briefing and surprise executive actions work to keep their adversaries, the media and others off balance. On Tuesday, Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, happily kept reporters waiting while he did “a quick recap of the president’s activity,” proceeding to offer a long list of meetings and phone calls with foreign leaders, female entrepreneurs, local officials and educators. Yet the disruptions have come at a cost: the president has so far made little progress on legislation that would repeal President Barack Obama’s signature health care law. The White House has not proposed a promised infrastructure bill to repair deteriorating roads, bridges and tunnels. And the president’s aides have not yet drawn up plans for an overhaul of the nation’s tax code. “It’s pretty predictable,” Mr. Feehery said. “This guy has never been in government before and he promised to be disruptive. ” It may also have consequences for Mr. Trump’s ability to help Republicans win in the 2018 midterm elections. And Republican campaign experts acknowledge that his chances for winning   may hinge on his ability to contain the White House frenzy. “You are processing so much information in a day now. This stuff would have doomed anyone else, just one or two of them,” said Thomas M. Davis, a former Republican member of Congress from Virginia. “They have got to produce something. If all you’ve got is a bunch of executive orders and a Twitter feed, you don’t want to go into an election like that. ” Kevin Madden, who served as a senior adviser to Mitt Romney during both of his presidential campaigns, said Mr. Trump’s voters in 2016 wanted him to overhaul an establishment in Washington, which they view as long on promises, long on process but short on action. “Voters certainly asked for change. They certainly wanted to see disruption,” Mr. Madden said. “But if change begins to look like confusion and disruption morphs into disorder, you risk losing a certain level of confidence with voters. ”	1
133	DURHAM, N. C.  —   As soon as Chris Rock strode onstage here on Monday in the first performance of his   “Total Blackout Tour,” he explained why, nine years after his last   special, he’s pacing stages again: “That’s what alimony will do to you. ” Mr. Rock, who was married for 16 years,  divorced last year, and while his quip had the jackhammer snap that has long made him the best deliverer of punch lines in comedy, the old swagger faded during his     show. Now 52, Mr. Rock, looking trim in casual black pants and jacket, talked about his vanity, insecurities and failures with startling frankness. “I wasn’t a good husband,” he said, standing still, shifting into a quieter register. “I didn’t listen. I wasn’t kind. I cheated. ” Mr. Rock paused as the audience waited for the joke. It arrived eventually, but it did not match the impact of this silent, dramatic beat. In his new set, Mr. Rock appeared to be after something more than laughs. It is rare to see a celebrity discuss his infidelity with the specificity that he did here  —   detailing who and how many  —   but he talked about this in an anguished, searching tone that fans may find surprising. At times, Mr. Rock sounded like a man confessing his sins, turning vulnerability into his latest provocation. Ever since his breakthrough 1996 HBO special, “Bring the Pain”  —   his new set includes giant initials evoking that seminal show  —   Mr. Rock has maintained a secure place in the   pantheon. But in contrast with peers like Bill Burr and Louis C. K. his specials are infrequent enough that every one is a major event. His current show will be released as a special on Netflix, part of a   $40 million deal. His last, “Kill the Messenger,” was recorded during the 2008 election, and it’s hard not to be struck by his cheerful mood then, sounding positively giddy as he pokes fun at John McCain, skewering him as a “war hero who got captured. ” In the recent presidential campaign, Donald J. Trump made the same point about Mr. McCain in similar language, but without the punch line. In the past nine years, the line for transgression has shifted. But Mr. Rock didn’t try to adjust to it. Nor did he approach the recent election with what has become the standard alarm of many comedians. Barack Obama was the anomaly, he argued, while Mr. Trump is a return to business as usual in a conservative country always run by rich white men. “I’m not scared,” Mr. Rock said, looking to the evils of history for comfort. “I’m black. The future is always better when you’re black. ” Comedy is about surprise, and one reason Mr. Rock has been his generation’s finest political   is his ability to consistently go against the grain with conviction. (Unlike some, he always seems to believe the premises of his jokes.) The rise of Mr. Trump, he concluded, taking his critique to a comic extreme, stems from our battle against bullying. “We got rid of bullies,” he said. “When a real one showed up, we didn’t know what to do. ” He also discussed police shootings in an unexpected way, saying that he would think that law enforcement might try to shoot a white kid for once, “just for appearances. ” But he also spent time sympathizing with police officers, describing work that has zero room for error and draws pay that is far too low. If his current social commentary has a common thread, it’s an alertness to how economics colors every issue. “Whole Foods does not say ‘No Blacks Allowed,’” he said. “But a $7 orange does. That’s the new Jim Crow. ” What stood out most about this show, however, was the personal, not the political. Mr. Rock has mostly kept the audience at a distance from his private life. He isn’t the type to dwell on his demons or soul search on a podcast. So it’s a surprise to see him tell jokes about the dark consequences of his addiction to pornography or the excruciating details of family court. This is not his funniest show, but it might be his most compelling, a departure even in its form. The distance between his forceful   persona and the   more thoughtful one he displays in interviews has shrunk a bit  —   and his jokes are more intricate, denser. What remains firm is a lyricist’s gift for concision, boiling down a thought to its comic essence. On bullying: “Pressure makes diamonds. Not hugs. ” Mr. Rock’s comedy has always been happily cynical about marriage, his jokes regarding relationships rooted in regressive stereotypes about men and women. He’s found many laughs in sympathy for men behaving badly, blaming Hillary Clinton for her husband’s cheating and pointing out how O. J. Simpson had to pay steep alimony while his former wife slept with another man. (“I’m not saying he should have killed her, but I understand. ”) When discussing his own marriage, however, he blamed only himself, repeatedly, allowing sadness to creep into his dynamic voice. He also dug into his past, telling a story about his grandmother disparaging poor men that stuck with him for years, and another about his grandfather mocking him for crying. Mr. Rock wants to tell us where he came from, and also where he hopes to go. “I’m trying to get a little bit of religion,” he said, before backtracking: “Not a lot. ” He added that he believes in God, but only a bit. Onstage, Mr. Rock has always had the intonations of a preacher  —   which his grandfather was  —   repeating premises until they sound like incantations. But his real religion is comedy, and at the end of this discussion of his relationship with God, he contrasted the sureness of faith with the questioning nature of a comic. But as comedians go, Mr. Rock has always been one of the most forcefully confident. What’s different is he now sounds more anxious. And while the election and his divorce may have added heaviness to his gait, this evolution may also stem from simply growing older. In a line he repeated over and over on Monday, Mr. Rock explained his spiritual search in the hardheaded pragmatic terms we’ve come to expect from him: “I want to find God before God finds me. ”	1
140	In the hours since Michael T. Flynn resigned as national security adviser late Monday, two narratives have emerged. One, embraced by many in the traditional legacy media, centered on what Mr. Flynn had done that led to his resignation: discussing sanctions against Russia in a conversation with the Russian ambassador, and then misleading Vice President Mike Pence about it. The other, which developed among the more   news media, focused on the leaks from Washington that had put pressure on Mr. Flynn to step aside, and whether these leaks were intended to damage President Trump. One narrative holds Mr. Flynn, and others who knew about his discussions, accountable. The other portrays Mr. Flynn more as a victim. The focus on leaks intensified on Wednesday, after The New York Times reported late Tuesday that Trump aides and associates had made repeated contact with senior Russian officials during the presidential campaign. Which narrative does Mr. Trump ascribe to? On Tuesday morning, he attributed Mr. Flynn’s resignation to “illegal leaks. ” On Wednesday morning, Mr. Trump again denounced the leaks in a blizzard of tweets. It is not unusual for news media to promote different story angles. And the division between   and   news organizations is certainly not new. But the rift between the mainstream media and more partisan news organizations has grown starker in the nearly four weeks since Mr. Trump took office, reflecting a widening political and ideological rift. The growing division means that some readers are getting their news through an   prism. Americans who get their information predominantly from Breitbart News, a   news and opinion site, for instance, or from the conservative Fox News are getting a very different version of the news from Americans who read The Washington Post or watch CNN. Late Monday night, as the news broke that Mr. Flynn had resigned, news organizations rushed to publish articles. Not Breitbart. For roughly an hour after Mr. Flynn’s resignation letter began circulating, Breitbart did not change the main story on its home page, which was about immigration policy. When Breitbart made the Flynn resignation its main story, around midnight, the account hewed closely to the facts of Mr. Flynn’s resignation and quoted heavily from his resignation letter. The site also put up a more analytical article that raised questions about the motives behind the government’s monitoring of communications between Mr. Flynn and the Russian ambassador. “Democrats are clamoring for a deeper investigation of Russian ties to Trump,” the article said. “But the more serious question is whether our nation’s intelligence services were involved in what amounts to political espionage against the newly elected government. ” The article also raised questions about how the news media got its information, reinforcing a distrust of the press that Mr. Trump and his administration have assiduously tried to foster. “The fact that the contents of Flynn’s phone conversation  —   highly sensitive intelligence  —   were leaked to the media suggests that someone with access to that information also has a political axe to grind,” the article said. The emphasis on the leaks continued into Tuesday afternoon with an article at the top of Breitbart’s site on the White House briefing and the assertion by Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, that the leaks were an overlooked part of the reporting on Mr. Flynn. The narrative gained more steam on Wednesday morning, after the damaging reports Tuesday night: An article on the Breitbart home page seized on Mr. Trump’s early morning tweets attacking the coverage rather than the news about the Russian contacts. Fox News also advanced this   narrative on Tuesday and Wednesday. During one segment on “Fox  Friends” on Tuesday, Laura Ingraham, a conservative commentator and Fox News contributor, suggested that the leaks were politically motivated. “The long knives were out for Flynn almost the moment that he was announced,” she said. “I think this really was the death by a thousand leaks,” Ms. Ingraham added. “The leaks that were coming out of this administration and the transition, before the administration, were at a level that I don’t remember seeing for quite some time. ” Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, a Republican, also focused on the leaks during an appearance on the channel. “Who tapped the phones, who was listening to it, who leaked it? I think those are legitimate questions to ask,” he said. “Let’s face it,” he later said, “leaks of this nature are incredibly damaging to America, to our national security, and we need to look into it. ” Tuesday night ended on a predictably outraged note, with Sean Hannity, a Trump supporter, suggesting on his show that the left was “willing to do anything to stop President Trump from draining the swamp and changing the status quo. ” “Impeachment of the president is clearly the end goal for the left,” Mr. Hannity added. “Facts, truth, it doesn’t really matter. Mike Flynn is just a small casualty of that bigger plan. ” On Wednesday, the main article on the Fox News home page highlighted the president’s condemnation of the leaks to the media. Journalists at more centrist news organizations, including CNN and NPR, attributed Mr. Flynn’s resignation to the strong reporting and investigative journalism that had exposed details of Mr. Flynn’s talks with Russia. Rather than casting aspersion on leaks about Mr. Flynn, these commentators praised their contributions to accountability journalism. Joe Scarborough, a host of MSNBC’s “Morning Joe,” went so far as to call the person who had leaked information “a patriot. ” “The only reason we’re finding out about it now is because a patriot did leak this to The Washington Post, did get this information out there, or else we wouldn’t have even known about it,” said Mr. Scarborough, a former Republican congressman from Florida. The Columbia Journalism Review, a publication that chronicles and analyzes the news media, was perhaps the most pointed. An article on Tuesday  —   with the headline “Flynn resignation shows leaks under Trump are working. Keep ‘em coming. ”  —   described how several recent leaks had ultimately forced the Trump administration to reverse course or make changes. “Some of these leaks have halted a Trump appointment and controversial policies in their tracks,” the article said, “and it’s a lesson showing how   and leaks to the press are vital for democracy. ”	1
666	 Last week, during a promotional press conference for The History Channel’s upcoming series “First Ladies in Their Own Words,” series’ host Ron Reagan shared clips of his interviews with all living former First Ladies of the United States. In a brief video clip with his mother Nancy Reagan, she offered her endorsement of Hillary Clinton as President saying, “The time for a woman to serve as our President has come – really, now is the time – and I think the idea of having a former First Lady as the leader of the free world is really quite a marvelous notion. I want Hillary to win. Even though I admire two of the current potential Republican nominees, I have no interest in seeing either of them lead this country.” National Report is a news and political satire web publication, which may or may not use real names, often in semi-real or mostly fictitious ways.

60	Raymond Smullyan, whose merry, agile mind led him to be a musician, a magician, a mathematician and, most cunningly, a   logician, died on Monday in Hudson, N. Y. He was 97. His death was confirmed by Deborah Smullyan, a cousin. Professor Smullyan was a serious mathematician, with the publications and the doctorate to prove it. But his greatest legacy may be the devilishly clever logic puzzles that he devised, presenting them in numerous books or just in casual conversation. Sometimes they were   and sometimes they were embedded in longer narratives to explain mathematical concepts, such as Boolean logic, as he did in “The Magic Garden of George B and Other Logic Puzzles” in 2015 or retrograde analysis, as he explored in the “The Chess Mysteries of the Arabian Knights” in 1981. He was also a character. With his long white hair and beard, Professor Smullyan resembled Ian McKellen’s wizard, Gandalf, from the “Lord of the Rings” film series. He was lanky, hated exercise and loved steak and eggs. He studied Eastern religion. He told corny jokes and performed   magic to anyone near him. He played the piano with passion and talent into his 90s. (A career in music had been derailed by tendinitis when he was a young man.) And he was fond of his philosophical, if silly, sayings, such as, “Why should I worry about dying? It’s not going to happen in my lifetime!” Melvin Fitting, a retired professor of mathematics, philosophy and computer science at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York, recalled Professor Smullyan’s demeanor as his teacher at Yeshiva University in the 1960s while Professor Fitting was pursuing his doctorate. “He’d be smiling in anticipation of the many beautiful things he was going to show you,” the professor said in an interview. Professor Smullyan saw beauty in the puzzles that he created, seemingly nonstop, over the decades, and viewed them as tools to spread the gospel of mathematics. In his 1982 book “The Lady or the Tiger? And Other Logic Puzzles,” he wrote about the greater popularity that Euclid’s “Elements” would have achieved had the Greek mathematician framed it as a puzzle book. He wrote: “Problem: Given a triangle with two equal sides, are two of the angles necessarily equal? Why, or why not?” His puzzles were so much a part of his identity that he posed one on his first date with his future wife, Blanche de Grab. What he posed to her was a statement that, in the way he framed it, could only result in a kiss from her. Reminiscing about it, he wrote that it was a “pretty sneaky way of winning a kiss, wasn’t it?” Jason Rosenhouse, a mathematics professor at James Madison University, who edited a book in 2015 celebrating Mr. Smullyan, said the clarity of his puzzles could unveil the beauty of math to those who could not previously grasp it. “It was like fooling a kid into eating his vegetables,” Professor Rosenhouse said in a telephone interview, adding, “Raymond took something like Gödel’s incompleteness theorems and used a string of logic puzzles as a device for presenting them. ” Martin Gardner, himself a renowned math puzzler, compared Professor Smullyan to the Oxford logician Charles Dodgson, who also was an author better known by his pen name, Lewis Carroll. Professor Smullyan paid tribute to Carroll in his 1982 book “Alice in  : A Carrollian Tale for Children Under Eighty. ” In one chapter, Professor Smullyan wrote, Alice thinks to herself about how confusing, yet remarkably logical, Humpty Dumpty is. “I wonder,” she says, “how he manages to be both confusing and logical?” There was, it would seem, some confusing logic in the zigzagging path of Mr. Smullyan’s life. Raymond Merrill Smullyan was born in Far Rockaway, Queens, on May 25, 1919. His father, Isidore, was a businessman his mother, the former Rosina Freeman, a homemaker. His education was peripatetic and eclectic. He attended both Pacific University and Reed College in Oregon, then studied mathematics and logic on his own. He learned magic. He created chess puzzles that were more concerned about moves that had been made than the ones that should be made. He put together a magic act, and performed under the stage name   Merrill at nightclubs like the Pump Room in Chicago, where he worked for tips. He went on to get his bachelor’s degree in mathematics from the University of Chicago and a Ph. D. from Princeton. He taught at Princeton, Yeshiva, Lehman College of the City University of New York and Indiana University. His philosophy of teaching was a little puzzling. “My policy is to teach the student as much as possible and to require from him or her as little as possible,” he told Donald Albers and Gerald Alexanderson, the authors of “Mathematical People: Profiles and Interviews” in 2008. But, he added, the impact of his apparent lenience was that many of his students worked harder in his course than in any other. Professor Smullyan is survived by his stepson, Jack Kotik six   and 16   . His wife Blanche, a   pianist and music educator, died in 2006. His first marriage ended in divorce. Mr. Kotik recalled being with his wife at the Smullyans’ house in Elka Park, N. Y. and listening to a radio report about the high salaries of professional athletes. His mother, Blanche, said they were excessive. Professor Smullyan said that to be paid so much was unfair. “I said, ‘Raymond, isn’t it true that you’re more intelligent than most people?’ ” Mr. Kotik said during a phone interview. “ ‘Yes,’ he said. So I said, ‘I think that’s unfair. We should take out part of your brain and distribute it to people who could use it.’ “He was silent for a minute, and finally he said, ‘I can’t give you any reason, but I wouldn’t do it.’ ” Puzzles were an essential part of Mr. Smullyan’s patois  —   a logician’s way of greeting and testing people. When he met his most recent editor, Rochelle Kronzek, he asked her to solve some problems. “It intimidated me at first, but I came up with creative answers,” Ms. Kronzek, the executive editor of World Scientific Publishing, said in an interview, “and more than once he smiled because he liked the way I was thinking. He got a lot of joy out of seeing how other people thought. ”	1
164	WASHINGTON  —   House Republican leaders on Thursday presented their    members with the outlines of their plan to replace the Affordable Care Act, leaning heavily on tax credits to finance individual insurance purchases and sharply reducing federal payments to the 31 states that have expanded Medicaid eligibility. Speaker Paul D. Ryan and two House committee chairmen stood with the new secretary of health and human services, former Representative Tom Price of Georgia, preparing Republican lawmakers for a weeklong Presidents’ Day recess that promises to be dominated by angry or anxious questions about the fate of the health law. But the talking points they provided did not say how the legislation would be paid for, essentially laying out the benefits without the more controversial costs. It also included no estimates of the number of people who would gain or lose insurance under the plan, nor did it include comparisons with the Affordable Care Act, which has extended coverage to 20 million people. With the House proposal’s rollback of Medicaid payments to the states, it appears likely that the number covered would be smaller. House Republican leaders asserted in a document describing their plan that they would not “pull the rug out from anyone who received care under states’ Medicaid expansions. ” But Kenneth E. Raske, the president of the Greater New York Hospital Association, expressed alarm, saying the proposals would “put a huge amount of pressure on state budgets and put many Americans at risk of losing health care coverage. ” Sketchy as the outline was, it envisions major changes. It would fundamentally remake Medicaid, a Great Society program that provides health care to more than 70 million Americans, not just the poor, but also   people who have run out of money and need nursing home care. Under the plan, Medicaid, an   entitlement program designed to cover all health care needs, would be put on a budget. The Affordable Care Act’s subsidies, which expand as incomes decline, giving the poorer people more help, would be replaced by fixed tax credits to help people purchase insurance policies. The tax credits would increase with a person’s age, but would not vary with a person’s income. And new incentives for consumers to establish savings accounts to pay medical expenses still assume that workers would have money at the end of a pay period to sock away. The House Republican plan would also make it easier for consumers to buy health insurance from companies licensed in other states, an idea long promoted by Republicans in Congress and championed by President Trump in his campaign last year. After the recess, Mr. Ryan said: “We intend to introduce legislation to repeal and replace Obamacare. It has become increasingly clear that this law is collapsing. People’s premiums are getting higher and higher. Their deductibles are soaring, and their choices are dwindling. ” Mr. Price told House Republicans that Mr. Trump “is all in on this. ” Mr. Ryan’s presentation on Thursday was meant to generate a sense of momentum for the Republicans’ campaign to eviscerate President Barack Obama’s health care law  —   a campaign that has been plagued by apprehensions, doubts and divisions among Republicans in the last few weeks. It was not clear whether the plan as outlined would get Republicans much closer to resolution. Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, chairman of the Senate health committee, said that he and other Senate committee chairmen were working with their House counterparts, with the goal of developing a “consensus document. ” The House, he said, will probably act first but “will have the input of senators and the president. ” House conservatives are saying that any plan must begin with a full repeal of the Affordable Care Act and a replacement that looks nothing like it. Representative Mark Meadows, Republican of North Carolina and the chairman of the   Freedom Caucus, said Republicans needed to talk about replacement measures “in specific terms, not in aspirational terms. ” “We believe that it’s time that we make some very difficult decisions and move forward,” Mr. Meadows said. Any plan that can satisfy House conservatives would face great uncertainty in the more moderate Senate. The plan unveiled on Thursday by House Republican leaders would make huge changes in Medicaid. It would eventually undo the Affordable Care Act’s expansion of Medicaid and give each state a fixed amount of money for each beneficiary. As an alternative, they said, a state could receive a lump sum of federal money for all of its Medicaid program, or a block grant. In either case, the federal government would gradually reduce the extra payments it makes to states that have expanded Medicaid under the 2010 health care law. States could continue providing Medicaid to the newly eligible beneficiaries, but the federal share of the costs would decline to the regular federal share of Medicaid costs for other beneficiaries. The federal government now pays more than 90 percent of the costs for newly eligible beneficiaries in states that expanded Medicaid. Under the House Republican plan, the federal share would decline to 50 percent in states like New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and California, resulting in a significant loss of federal revenue. In a number of states that have expanded Medicaid, Republican governors and Republican members of Congress have made clear that they do not like the idea of a block grant or a   allotment. The Congressional Budget Office says that 12 million people have insurance because they became eligible for Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, and it estimates that federal spending for this group will be $70 billion this year. The House Republican plan would immediately eliminate tax penalties for people who do not have insurance and employers that do not offer it. It would also eliminate taxes and fees that help pay for the expansion of coverage under the 2010 health care law. These include fees collected from health insurance companies and manufacturers of   prescription drugs and an excise tax on makers of medical devices. House Republicans have repeatedly said that they would continue providing some protection for people with   medical conditions. But the document describing their proposal does not say how they would do that. Mr. Ryan said the tax credits envisioned by House Republicans were different from those provided in the Affordable Care Act. Under that law, the tax credits are available only for insurance products that meet detailed federal standards and are purchased through an insurance exchange like HealthCare. gov. By contrast, Mr. Ryan said, with the Republican version of tax credits, people can “buy the health insurance plan of their choosing,” which could cost less and have less generous coverage than the plans now available. “You get the freedom to do what you want and buy what you need,” Mr. Ryan said. During a transition period, House Republicans would continue “Obamacare subsidies,” but they would provide a little more assistance to young people and a little less to older Americans. The House Republican plan would provide an unspecified amount of money for “innovation grants,” which states could use to help defray consumers’    costs or to establish “  pools” for people with serious chronic conditions.	1
932	 Did Pope Benedict say that the Bible and the Q’ran are the same? True or false? On Monday the Bishop Of Rome addressed Catholic followers regarding the dire importance of exhibiting religious tolerance. During his hour-long speech, a smiling Pope Francis was quoted telling the Vatican’s guests that the Koran, and the spiritual teachings contained therein, are just as valid as the Holy Bible.“Jesus Christ, Jehovah, Allah. These are all names employed to describe an entity that is distinctly the same across the world. For centuries, blood has been needlessly shed because of the desire to segregate our faiths. This, however, should be the very concept which unites us as people, as nations, and as a world bound by faith. Together, we can bring about an unprecedented age of peace, all we need to achieve such a state is respect each others beliefs, for we are all children of God regardless of the name we choose to address him by. We can accomplish miraculous things in the world by merging our faiths, and the time for such a movement is now. No longer shall we slaughter our neighbors over differences in reference to their God.”   On Wednesday the Bishop Of Rome addressed 11,000 ticketed guests on the South Lawn of the White House, during which he pontificated on the dire importance of exhibiting religious tolerance. During his hour-long speech, a smiling Pope Francis was quoted telling the White House guests that the Koran, and the spiritual teachings contained therein, are just as valid as the Holy Bible, and should therefore be respected as such.	0

108	A couple of weeks ago, people boycotted Nordstrom for one reason: The department store sold Ivanka Trump products. Now people are boycotting Nordstrom for another reason: The store said it would not sell her products. These days, a shirt is not always just a shirt, and a store is not always just a store. Handbags, dresses and other ordinary items  —   and where they are bought  —   have become politicized, turning shopping decisions into acts of protest for the millions of people in   and   Trump camps. Under Armour, L. L. Bean, T. J. Maxx and many other companies have already been pulled into a sort of ideological tug of war. But perhaps no retailer has been in the hot seat like Nordstrom. The “boycott Nordstrom” movement instantly changed political direction after the department store scrubbed Ms. Trump’s name from its site last week. Thousands of people lashed out at the retailer online. Even President Trump himself posted on Twitter that his daughter had been treated “unfairly. ” The sharp reaction before and after Nordstrom’s decision  —   made quietly, with no announcement  —   highlights the tightrope companies must walk in this   environment. “Companies are nervous,” said Andrew Gilman, chief executive of the crisis communications firm CommCore Consulting Group. “I know several companies that have war rooms set up. ” “They have playbooks on what to do if there is a product recall or if the C. E. O. has a heart attack,” he added. “Now they have a different chapter on how to deal with a tweet from the president. ” Many retailers and brands would clearly prefer to fly below the political radar and stay away from the outrage on Twitter and Facebook. Calls or emails sent to a   of the country’s largest department stores about how they are handling Ms. Trump’s products, for example, resulted in either no comment or carefully neutral statements. None of the stores agreed to discuss how they made decisions around Ms. Trump’s merchandise or details about sales of the products. But many of these companies  —   like L. L. Bean and Macy’s  —   still find themselves in the eye of a social media storm. So, too, does the Ivanka Trump brand. “In recent days, we’ve seen our brand swept into the political fray, becoming collateral damage in others’ efforts to advance agendas unrelated to what we do, which is produce accessible,   products for our loyal customers,” the brand said in a statement. The   maker Under Armour also encountered the perils this week, when its chief executive, Kevin Plank, called Mr. Trump a “real asset” for the country. Within hours, the hashtag #boycottunderarmour emerged on social media. Under Armour moved quickly to contain the damage, clarifying Mr. Plank’s remarks by saying he supported Mr. Trump’s business policies, not his social viewpoints. It is unclear how much the boycotts and activism are shaping businesses’ financial results, especially at big department stores, which are battling weak sales across the board. The Ivanka Trump brand said it had experienced “  growth” in revenue last year, and planned to continue expanding its offerings and distribution in 2017. Consumer companies, more broadly, have long faced campaigns against their products for political, social or environmental reasons. There have been boycotts over the use of sweatshop labor, dangerous chemicals and even microbeads. But now, companies are dealing with even more intense pressure, as they have become targets in a politically charged environment fueled by social media. After Nordstrom pulled Ms. Trump’s products, many people opposed to Mr. Trump cheered the decision. But Josh Cornett, a    Trump supporter in Cleveland, was quick to tell his 25, 000 followers not to shop at the department store. “All you have to do is write out a sentence, and you’re done,” he said. “Anything that helps him, I try to promote,” he said, referring to Mr. Trump. “And anyone who attacks him, I try to defend. ” Nordstrom said that Ms. Trump’s products were simply not selling well, and that remaining inventory would still be available in some physical stores. But that has not stopped people like Mr. Cornett from viewing the decision through a political lens, and asserting that the company took a stand. “Companies are now being swept up into this political consumer activism in a way that they have not been in the past,” said Maurice Schweitzer, a professor of operations, information and decisions at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. Nordstrom is one of more than a dozen other retailers that have found themselves in the cross hairs of Grab Your Wallet, an online campaign to boycott companies associated with the Trump brand. The movement has also protested brands that donated to Mr. Trump’s campaign or advertised on “The New Celebrity Apprentice,” on which he is credited as an executive producer. Some major companies, including Macy’s, the country’s largest department store, still sell Ms. Trump’s shoes, handbags and clothes. Those companies remain on Grab Your Wallet’s list. Macy’s did not respond to multiple requests for comment. But many companies that are on the   list argue they have not picked a side and should not be there. For instance, in the days before his inauguration, Mr. Trump tweeted his thanks for the support of an L. L. Bean heir and encouraged consumers to buy products from the merchandiser. Soon, the company, based in Maine, was the focus of the Grab Your Wallet campaign. In a statement also posted on social media and elsewhere, L. L. Bean urged the campaign to reverse its position, explaining that the Trump supporter, Linda Bean, was one of more than 50 family members involved in the business. It added that L. L. Bean did not endorse political candidates or take positions on political matters. “Simply put,” the statement read, “we stay out of politics. ” Still, other business leaders appear eager to dash into the political fray. After Mr. Trump signed an executive order in late January that suspended the country’s refugee program and barred individuals from certain countries from entering the United States, Howard Schultz, the chief executive of Starbucks, announced plans to hire 10, 000 refugees over the next five years. Like with Nordstrom, the response was largely split down the political divide. “There’s a real difference in styles emerging here. L. L. Bean wants to stay low, saying, ‘We’re not political. We don’t want to pick sides,’” said Professor Schweitzer, of the Wharton School. “But Howard Schultz is positioning Starbucks as a more   place,” Professor Schweitzer continued. “He’s aligning the company with the employees and most of the customers in taking that stance. ”	1
255	PALM BEACH, Fla.  —   On Friday night, Fox News aired an alarming   segment in which the host, Tucker Carlson, interviewed a documentary filmmaker about a crisis of violence in Sweden ignited by the recent wave of Muslim migration. “The government has gone out of its way to try to cover up some of these problems,” declared Ami Horowitz, the filmmaker. “That is grotesque,” Mr. Carlson responded. One of his viewers agreed, and in that moment was born a diplomatic incident that illustrates the unusual approach that President Trump takes to foreign policy, as well as the influence that television can have on his thinking. After watching the program, Mr. Trump threw a line into a speech the next day suggesting that a terrorist attack had occurred in Sweden the night before. Just like that, without white papers, intelligence reports, an interagency meeting or, presumably, the advice of his secretary of state, the president started a dispute with a longtime American friend that resented his characterization and called it false. The president’s only discernible goal was to make the case domestically for his plans to restrict entry to the United States. The Swedes were flabbergasted. “We are used to seeing the president of the U. S. as one of the most   persons in the world, also well aware of the importance of what he says,” Carl Bildt, a former prime minister of Sweden, said by email on Monday. “And then, suddenly, we see him engaging in misinformation and slander against a truly friendly country, obviously relying on sources of a quality that at best could be described as dubious. ” While aides sought to clarify that Mr. Trump’s remarks were about a rising tide of crime in general, rather than any particular event or attack, the president chose to escalate. In a Twitter post on Monday, he accused American journalists of glossing over a dark and dangerous situation in Sweden. “Give the public a break,” he wrote. “The FAKE NEWS media is trying to say that large scale immigration in Sweden is working out just beautifully. NOT!” Sweden’s prime minister, Stefan Lofven, responded hours later at a news conference, noting that Sweden ranks highly on international comparisons of economic competitiveness and human development. “We have challenges, no doubt about that,” he allowed. But he added pointedly, “We must all take responsibility for using facts correctly and for verifying anything we spread. ” Sweden is hardly the first American friend to find itself uncomfortably at odds with the new president. Mexico’s president canceled a meeting with Mr. Trump over his plans to build a border wall and bill the United States’ southern neighbor for it. Mr. Trump reportedly lit into Australia’s prime minister over refugees in a telephone call that was said to have ended abruptly. But the episode underscored that Mr. Trump obtains, processes and uses information differently from any modern president. He watches television at night and tends to incorporate what he sees into his Twitter feed, speeches and interviews. “It begs the question of where the president gets his information as he articulates his administration’s global approach,” said Mark Brzezinski, the ambassador to Sweden under President Barack Obama. “To do so in an improvisational way, based on snippets picked up from cable news, is a major mistake. ” Immigration is a hotly debated issue in Sweden, Germany and many other European countries. Sweden, which prides itself as a humanitarian leader, processed a record 163, 000 asylum applications in 2015. But statistics in Sweden do not back up the suggestion that immigrants have created a major crime wave. Preliminary data released last month by Sweden’s crime prevention council found no significant increase in crimes from 2015 to 2016, even with the influx of migrants. The council did note an increase in assaults and rapes last year, but it also recorded a drop in thefts and drug offenses. Still, a Pew Research Center survey last year found that 46 percent of Swedes said refugees were more to blame for crime than other groups. Manne Gerell, a doctoral student in criminology at Malmo University in Sweden, said in an interview that immigrants were disproportionately represented among crime suspects, particularly in more serious and violent offenses. But he noted that many of the victims were other immigrants, whether members of criminal networks or simply residents of poor neighborhoods. “Immigration will come with some cost, and we will likely have a bit more crime  —   but that’s in a society with low crime rates and in a society that works really well, so in my opinion, it’s something we can live with,” he said. “I know everybody won’t agree with that. But immigration will not double the crime rate, make everybody go broke or turn Sweden into a living hell. ” Although terrorism is a concern for Sweden  —   an   Swede blew himself up in central Stockholm in 2010  —   the authorities say they are equally worried about racist hate crimes, including attacks on migrants. The Fox News segment featured an interview with Mr. Horowitz, whose short film, “Stockholm Syndrome,” depicted Sweden as a place where rape and violence have been on the rise since it began accepting more refugees from Muslim countries. In the Fox interview, Mr. Horowitz acknowledged that most Swedes do not see the situation as he does. “They’ll make excuses for it,” he said. “The majority of the population in Sweden still wants to have an   policy. It’s confounding. ” Mr. Trump was clearly struck by the interview, and he cited Sweden at a rally in Melbourne, Fla. on Saturday as he argued for stronger borders. “You look at what’s happening last night in Sweden,” he said. “Sweden! Who would believe this? Sweden. They took in large numbers. They’re having problems like they never thought possible. ” Aides later said “last night” referred to the Fox program, not to an episode the night before. Mr. Carlson argued on Monday that although “the president ought to be precise in what he says, there should be no confusion about what he means. ” Mr. Carlson said that assimilation had failed and that immigration was “in the process of totally changing these ancient cultures into something different and much more volatile and much more threatening. ” Critics of Sweden’s migration policies have pointed to a Facebook post on Feb. 3 by a police officer, Peter Springare, who said that migrants were taxing Sweden’s pension, education and health systems and that they were the principal culprits in assaults. “Half of the suspects we cannot even be sure of because they don’t have any valid papers,” he wrote. “Most often this means they are lying about their country of origin and identity. ” But the Swedish newspaper Dagens Nyheter on Monday quoted two police officers interviewed by Mr. Horowitz, Anders Goranzon and Jacob Ekstrom, as saying that the filmmaker had selectively edited and distorted their comments to prove his thesis. They said that Mr. Horowitz had asked them about   neighborhoods and that they did not agree with his argument about links between migration and crime. “We don’t stand behind what he says,” Mr. Goranzon said. “He is a madman. ” Mr. Horowitz did not respond to a request for comment, but he went back on Mr. Carlson’s show on Monday night to defend his work, citing crime statistics and asserting that the police officers had recanted because they were under pressure. “My record stands for itself,” he said, “and what you saw on that video clear as day stands for itself. ”	1
769	 Friend posted this on FB. Is it true? “Hatchet Massacre: 53 Dead After Man Slaughters Guests In Their Sleep On Halloween Night” Queen Mary’s “Dark Harbor” is an annual Halloween tradition, where people come from across the country to stay on the haunted ship during the Halloween holiday. The event consists of mazes, monsters, séances and haunted tours. However, the real scare came in a way no one ever expected it to.On Sunday morning, aboard the Queen Mary ship in Long Beach California, a graphic scene emerged as police did their best to get an accurate body count. At 2:33 AM, a guest aboard the ship approached the bartender at the Observation Bar dazed and confused. “Please, go down the hallway and see if you saw what I saw. It’s a massacre, a complete massacre,” said Paul Brown, a hotel guest on the ship.The bartender phoned security, and followed the man’s instructions. What they found down the hallway were 32 open room doors with trails of blood, so much blood that it was unlike anything detectives had seen before. 58 blood covered corpses awaited the police upon their arrival at the crime scene.	0
394	Twenty million dollars. That’s how much Julien Mellon needs to live the life he wants. With that kind of cash, Mr. Mellon, a    tour guide, could buy a “beautiful” home with enough left over to spend $100, 000 a year (“in 2017 dollars”) until the day he dies. That same number would also work for Celeste Hilling, the founder, chief and product formulator at Skin Authority. Twenty million would allow her to put her    daughter through college, “give to philanthropy  —   especially women’s and children’s causes  —   start another company, and travel as part of work combined with personal pursuits,” said Ms. Hilling, 58. And then there is Susan Sosnow, a real estate investor and landlord. All Ms. Sosnow, 49, needs to feel secure is $36, 000 a year. Really. She nets a fraction of that as a landlord. Explaining the relatively low figure, she said: “I’m not interested in traveling I’m interested in creating paradise at home, Candyland. I’m still driving the ’99 Ford Escort wagon I bought for $3, 200 cash in 2004. But sometimes it sits in my driveway for a week and I just ride my bike around. ” With just a bit more, she said: “I’d be able to pay my bills, contribute to my I. R. A. and have some left over for home improvements. Money may not buy happiness, but it can certainly buy freedom and security, which contribute mightily to happiness. It also helps alleviate sadness, as a 2015 paper found. In the study, researchers examined data from over 12, 000 Americans. Wealthier individuals did not experience greater feelings of happiness on a    basis, but they did experience reduced feelings of sadness. “We argue that this reduction in sadness occurs because money provides a sense of perceived control,” said Elizabeth W. Dunn, a psychology professor at the University of British Columbia and a   of the paper. She also   the book “Happy Money: The Science of Happier Spending. ” Jill Falcon, 46, a single    mother of a    agrees. While she does not believe there is a number to buy happiness, “Money buys safety, convenience, luxury,” she said. “It can reduce worries and stress. I would love the freedom money would bring. ” At a time when the ranks of the ultrawealthy  —   millionaires and even billionaires  —   are on the rise, the magic number for many people is surprisingly modest. So how much is “enough”? Clearly, the definition of enough depends on where you live and your responsibilities. Ms. Sosnow is single and lives in Gainesville, Fla. which is significantly less expensive than San Diego, where Ms. Hilling lives with her husband and daughter, or Brooklyn, where Mr. Mellon resides. For Ms. Falcon, “enough” is somewhere between $8 million and $10 million, so she could give her daughter “the best of everything,” as she put it: “Private school, college, money for an advanced degree at an Ivy League university, two homes, unlimited vacations. Retirement. Cars, gas, food, shelter, extras. I’d also like to make sure my mom is set for life not having to worry about money. ” But it’s not pure hedonism. Ms. Falcon also wants to contribute to charity. So does Andrea Todd. Her number hovers around $65 million. With that she would travel with her family. But “I see that as an educational experience more than a luxury item purchased with a windfall,” said Ms. Todd, 51, a writer and teacher in Sacramento who is married with three children. “We’d travel cheap and dirty, with immersion in mind. ” But she would also buy a farm for animals, as Jon Stewart and his wife, Tracey, did. While Ms. Todd would continue teaching at Cristo Rey, a Catholic high school in Sacramento, she would not take a salary. She would also give money to all her alma maters that would be used for tuition. “I worked my way through Catholic school and college,” she said. “It would make me very happy to ensure other students were relieved of that stress. ” “We have a half mil in the bank, and I panic all the time about not having enough,” Ms. Todd said. In addition to her parents and   all of whom are in their 90s “with two pension plans possibly running out,” her two children will be heading to college in the next five years. She also has a $500, 000 home with $400, 000 still owed on it and a retirement fund that did not begin until 2002, when her husband graduated from law school. Others would like enough money to allow them to pursue other interests. Valerie Smaldone, a media personality and brand strategist in New York, who declined to give her age, said she could make it work with a monthly stipend of $10, 000 for the rest of her life. She’d like a minimum of $250, 000 in retirement income on top of that, which would continue to appreciate yearly. She doesn’t plan to ever stop working, but if she had “stupid money” to live off, she said, she would “produce a film or a play, or provide funding to animals who are abused. Learn something I always wanted to learn. Take a serious wine course, or do something in the food industry. ” Melissa Soalt, the founder of global   programs for women, would be set with a cool $5 million. “Being   often means having to ‘sing for my supper,’” said Ms. Soalt, 61, of Amherst, Mass. “This would take some of the pressure off. It would not only make my life more secure  —   I would purchase a modest home  —   but allow me to do more to help the world. ” “Without the actual money, things remain realistically out of reach,” she added. Kendall Rush, 47 and a grandfather, knows exactly how he would allocate his fantasy $6 million: He would take $2 million to pay off debts for himself and his immediate family, secure housing and transportation, and set up a communal trust fund with the rest for emergencies and medical. “The third million would go toward relocation of myself and my household,” Mr. Rush, a   administrator for the Niagara Frontier Transportation Authority in Buffalo, wrote in an email. “Half a million for educational trust fund for kids and family. Half a million in personal accounts for    expenses. One million for investments  . One million to invest in small, local businesses. ” Steve Sims, 50, a father of three and the founder of Bluefish, an international executive concierge service with United States headquarters in Los Angeles, has a more philosophical approach to lucre. “Being an unwealthy kid from East London, and now living on Mulholland Drive in Hollywood, I’m not exactly living on street corners,” Mr. Sims said. “In East London, if I got 250 pounds a week, I thought I was golden boy, because I could walk into a pub and drink myself stupid. ” As he got older and made money, he felt the need to show off all the trappings of his rich life. “I remember buying a Porsche and then a Bentley because it looked better,” he said. He has also owned a Ferrari. He got rid of them (now he collects motorcycles  —   he has nine) but he is fond of his lifestyle. So if for some reason he could no longer work, he would like $10 million. “Ten million dollars wouldn’t affect my lifestyle and allow me to continue it,” which includes zipping around the world at a moment’s notice, he said. Lynne Dewhurst McBurney, 50, who manages litigation for a financial services company and lives with her husband and son in Ridgewood, N. J. would not quit her job if she got her $6 million. But she might retire earlier. “Maybe it’s a secret homage to Lee Majors,” she said, referring to the actor who played the lead in “The Six Million Dollar Man,” a 1970s television show. “But it’s more like, own my home plus a    in Paris, and a cottage in Maine, and live off interest income from the $4 million we’d have left,” she said. Mr. Mellon has a more visceral reason for how he arrived at his $20 million number. “The real story for me personally is how bad it hurts that I don’t believe I will ever be able to own a home in the place where I grew up,” said Mr. Mellon, who was raised in the Flatbush section of Brooklyn. The actress Michelle Williams “bought the house I grew up dreaming of” in the Victorian Flatbush Historic District, said Mr. Mellon. If housing weren’t an issue, he would need very little: just enough to invest so he would never need to work again. “If I assume that I can own it outright, I imagine having enough to replace the boiler and fix the roof and keep up with my membership at MoMA,” he said. As for Ms. Sosnow, her life is simple and straightforward. “If I wanted more money, I could pursue it, but why?” she said.	1
323	OXON HILL, Md.  —   In an administration hardly five weeks old, Stephen K. Bannon’s reputation has taken on almost mythic proportion as a   populist, emerging power center, man of mystery. When Mr. Bannon, President Trump’s chief strategist, appeared in public on Thursday for the first time since the president was sworn in, it was to deliver, in his own combative way, a message of soothing reassurance to the conservative activists gathered here for their annual assessment known as the Conservative Political Action Conference. Do not believe the “corporatist globalist media” that was “crying and weeping” on election night and is still “dead wrong” about what the Trump administration is doing. Inside the White House, Mr. Bannon said, everything is going according to plan. The “deconstruction of the administrative state” has just begun. Appearing with Reince Priebus, the president’s chief of staff, he joked about how well the two get along despite the friction that had always existed between them. “I can run a little hot on occasion,” Mr. Bannon said, complimenting Mr. Priebus’s equanimity. And he urged a ballroom full of activists to stick together against the forces that were trying to tear them apart. “Whether you’re a populist, whether you’re a   conservative, whether you’re a libertarian, whether you’re an economic nationalist,” he said, “we want you to have our back. ” Despite Mr. Bannon’s assurances, a simmering unease remains among conservatives over whether Mr. Trump will honor his promises to them, given that he was not part of their movement  —   or any political movement, for that matter  —   until very recently. Not too many years ago CPAC almost denied Mr. Trump a speaking slot because it feared he only wanted to promote himself. As for Mr. Bannon, he was essentially banished from the premises when he was running Breitbart News. So Mr. Bannon started a  rival conference at a hotel down the street and called it The Uninvited. Kellyanne Conway, the White House counselor, acknowledged the discomfort that comes with any hostile party takeover when she addressed the meeting. Mr. Trump, she said, had to uproot the political system. “Every great movement ends up being a little bit sclerotic and dusty after a time,” she said. She predicted that CPAC would wholly embrace the new president. “Well, I think by tomorrow this will be TPAC,” she said. Part of what has been so problematic in Mr. Trump’s first month is that the disruption he promised to unleash on the federal bureaucracy so far seems to be occurring in the wrong place: his administration, which has been rife with infighting and rattled by early missteps. The destructive forces that Mr. Bannon and other conservatives complain about can sometimes come from within. Mr. Trump’s first nominee for labor secretary withdrew after allegations of domestic abuse and revelations that he had employed an undocumented immigrant he did not pay taxes on. His hastily carried out executive order barring refugees and all visitors from seven predominantly Muslim countries has been tangled up in the courts and blocked from going into effect. He fired his national security adviser. And questions of how closely members of his inner circle may have worked with the Russians to sabotage Hillary Clinton’s campaign continue to attract interest from investigators. “Disruption is a good thing,” said Matt Schlapp, the chairman of the American Conservative Union, which hosts CPAC. Still, he acknowledged, “on some days they do it better than others. ” There is another lens through which to see the disorder that has characterized this White House, Mr. Trump and his supporters say. And that is to understand that the president’s enemies  —   especially in the news media  —   want to distort his actions, exaggerate his mistakes and not discuss issues like safety and unemployment that are on the minds of his supporters. Gov. Matt Bevin, Republican of Kentucky, said he was appalled by the “unbelievable incessant focus on the most mindless things,” with regard to how the president is portrayed in the news media. “Let’s talk about crime rates. Let’s talk about economic viability. Let’s talk about joblessness,” Mr. Bevin added. “Let’s focus on things that matter and stop being so   and titillated by idiocy. ” Ms. Conway said the stories of disarray in the White House, including recent accounts that she has been sidelined lately, were nothing more than tiresome palace intrigue. And without naming names, she said the attacks directed at her were really desperate attacks against the president by political enemies still sore about the election. “To try to remove me from the equation would remove one of his voices and one of his trusted aides. And that would be hurtful to him,” she said. “They didn’t see this coming. They weren’t prepared for this result  —   even though they all ran around and said: ‘We’re a divided country! We’re a divided country! ’” It was not as if the support for Mr. Trump, who will speak to the conference Friday morning, is not enthusiastic. “I always said he’s not a stupid man. And if he has the right people around him he’s going to do the right thing,” said Daniel Cirucci of Cherry Hill, N. J. who was standing in line on Thursday evening to listen to Vice President Mike Pence, a conservative he said he deeply admired. “I think he realizes the enormity of the job,” Mr. Cirucci added. “Now does that mean Trump is going to stop being Trump? No. ” These should be good times for conservatives  —   and much of the time they are. They control not just the White House but both houses of Congress and appear on the verge of regaining a majority on the Supreme Court. They have not dominated so many state governments in close to a century. But part of the subtext of CPAC this year has been how conservative leaders are trying to smooth out the rougher edges of their movement, not all of which involve Mr. Trump. Because of the association that a fringe element of Trump supporters has with white nationalists, the CPAC organizers held a panel discussion on Thursday to signal their strong disapproval. Its title: The   Ain’t Right at All. Yet after the panel was over, the white nationalist leader Richard Spencer stood in the hall just off the main stage and declared himself a conservative. “I’m a conservative in a deep sense, in a sense that I care about people and defending a culture. ” And the organizers had to cancel a planned speech by Milo Yiannopoulos, the former Breitbart editor and Trump supporter who has a history of insulting Jews, Muslims,   and other minorities, after a tape surfaced in which he condoned sex with boys as young as 13. The projections of placidity inside CPAC tried to mask how fractious the movement remains. Yet optimists were not hard to find. Mr. Pence said the Trump victory has given conservatives “the most important time in the history of our movement. ” “My friends, this is our time,” he told the conference Thursday night. “This is the time to prove again that our answers are the right answers for America. ” In his brief remarks, Mr. Bannon ended on a conciliatory note. He insisted that conservatives all had more in common than most people realized. “We have wide and sometimes divergent opinions,” he said. But the core of what conservatives believe is “that we’re a nation with an economy, not an economy just in some global marketplace with open borders  —   that we’re a nation with a culture and a reason for being. “And I think that’s what unites us,” he added. “And I think that’s what’s going to unite this movement going forward. ”	1
137	When Jared Kushner was 17 years old, he stood where a million Jews had been murdered and listened to Israel’s prime minister stress the country’s importance. “The Holocaust could have been prevented. We know it could not have taken place had the Jewish state been established a few years earlier,” the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, said in 1998, standing amid the ruins of an   crematory. He had just led Mr. Kushner and thousands of other teenagers waving Israeli flags in a procession through the camp’s gates and past the barracks. As part of the commemoration, the group would soon leave Poland and fly to Israel, to complete the journey from slaughter to Zionist rebirth. Back then, Mr. Kushner was a high school basketball player, a Billy Joel fan, a quiz team manager and no one’s guess to become a negotiating partner with Mr. Netanyahu. But unlike other students on the trip, he knew the prime minister, who was friendly with his father, a real estate developer and donor to Israeli causes. Mr. Netanyahu had even stayed at the Kushners’ home in New Jersey, sleeping in Jared’s bedroom. (The teenager moved to the basement that night.) On Wednesday, when the Israeli prime minister visits the White House, Mr. Netanyahu and Mr. Kushner will reunite on far different terms from before  —   and yet their meeting will be imbued with some of the shared ideas of those old encounters. Mr. Netanyahu is on his second stint as prime minister Mr. Kushner, now 36, is President Trump’s    and a leading adviser on Middle Eastern affairs with a daunting assignment. Mr. Trump has said that Mr. Kushner will try to “do peace,” which the president has called “the ultimate deal. ” Mr. Kushner, on something of a crash course in diplomacy, has been speaking with Arab leaders in recent weeks. But he is a mystery to most Middle Eastern officials. He has no experience in government or international affairs. His   exposure to the Arab world amounts to little more than trips to a handful of Persian Gulf countries and a   jaunt to Jordan. Though Mr. Kushner has visited Israel since childhood, and more recently to do business, he is little known there. He holds strong views about the state of Israel, but he has not been outspoken about them, save for editorials in The New York Observer, the newspaper he owned. His thinking on matters like settlements is not well understood. “Israel wasn’t a political discussion for him it was his family, his life, his people,” said Hirschy Zarchi, rabbi at the Chabad House at Harvard, where Mr. Kushner was an undergraduate. Rather than diplomatic experience, Mr. Kushner has ties to Israel that are personal and religious. His visit to Auschwitz was stark, but its themes were not new to him. His grandmother survived the Holocaust by crawling through a homemade tunnel in Poland. His grandfather escaped the massacres by hiding in a hole for years. An Orthodox Jew, Mr. Kushner was instructed to protect Israel, remember the genocide and assure the survival of the Jewish people, those close to him say. He was educated at Jewish schools where second graders were expected to draw maps of Israel from memory and the West Bank was often referred to by its biblical names, Judea and Samaria, a practice that emphasizes Jewish claims to the land. His family used its real estate fortune to donate millions of dollars to American Jewish and Israeli hospitals, schools and other institutions, including a few in settlements, according to public records. In his classes, Palestinians were regarded at a distance, in part as security threats who committed acts of terrorism  —   including one that killed a sister of a classmate of Mr. Kushner’s. When Mr. Trump ran for president, his   ’s stances on Israel helped shape the campaign. Mr. Kushner helped script a speech to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee and consulted with Netanyahu officials behind the scenes. When he brought the candidate and the prime minister together for a meeting, his father, Charles Kushner, was invited to join them. Thanks in part to the younger Mr. Kushner, Mr. Netanyahu will arrive at a White House that has already adopted many of the prime minister’s perspectives on the region. Now Mr. Kushner is helping Mr. Trump and Mr. Netanyahu craft a strategy to recruit Sunni Muslim countries that oppose Iran to help foster an   peace agreement. The approach is a long shot: Negotiations are dead. The Israeli right is pushing for more settlement in the West Bank as talk among Palestinians turns to a single state in which they have equal rights. Mustafa Barghouti, a Palestinian leader who was involved in peace talks both with Israelis and internally, said Palestinians were skeptical of Mr. Kushner, and Mr. Trump’s team generally, seeing them as close only to the Israeli side. As part of its philanthropy, Mr. Kushner’s family has made donations to the Beit El settlement, which Mr. Barghouti finds particularly worrisome. “We need somebody who is really impartial,” Mr. Barghouti said, pointing out that it is unclear whether Mr. Kushner has ever visited a Palestinian area (the White House would not say). “There is no indication he is interested in hearing from the other side. ” Through a White House spokeswoman, Mr. Kushner declined to respond or be interviewed. But others said his life had given him cause to believe in the improbable. His grandparents survived against all odds, then came to America and made the kind of money of which most people can only dream. Mr. Kushner plunged into his   ’s presidential campaign with no experience and helped him win. “This is a region that has resisted solutions from people with vast résumés,” said Ken Kurson, editor of The New York Observer, suggesting that his former boss may do better. “For   years we’ve been sending the best diplomats in the world, and it’s yielded zero results. ” Mr. Kushner’s religious upbringing may have been intense, but his high school yearbook message was   with an ode to his   sneakers. He was a “6 ft. 2 inch basketball and hockey player who just loves to be comfortable,” the message said, noting that he also liked to deliver frozen yogurt and Slurpees to his siblings. There was little mention of Jewish identity beyond his Hebrew name, Yoel Chaim. But that was Mr. Kushner, classmates said in recent interviews: easygoing and polite, a decent student but not a standout, not particularly engaged in religious questions or the urgent political matters of the day. He did not participate in the high school club devoted to criticizing coverage of Israel in The New York Times. Many of his peers spent a year after graduation studying religious texts in Israel he did not. But his family was busy building a world to replace the one it had lost: schools, organizations, synagogues, campuses. The Kushners’ Judaism and support of Israel were one and the same, friends said: about ensuring survival. The major Jewish institutions of Mr. Kushner’s life  —   school and synagogue  —   emphasized the connection between religion and Zionism. “In the modern Orthodox community, the state of Israel has an important place in identity, as a religious ideal, not only a political reality,” said Elie Weinstock, rabbi at Kehilath Jeshurun, the Manhattan synagogue Mr. Kushner joined. At his elementary school, the Hebrew Youth Academy in Livingston, N. J. it was impossible to walk the halls “without seeing the flags of Israel and Israeli historical figures and how the kids celebrate Israeli holidays,” said Stephen Flatow, whose daughter Ilana was in Mr. Kushner’s grade. In eighth grade, their class was stunned by the killing of Ilana’s older sister, Alisa, in a bus bombing in the Gaza Strip. The school community “couldn’t fathom how a young man can load himself up with dynamite and blow himself up in a van and have his parents celebrating his death,” Mr. Flatow said. A few years later, the school was renamed for Jared Kushner’s grandfather, Joseph, and when a new building opened, the family dedicated the flagpole that flies the Israeli flag to Alisa’s memory. During high school at the Frisch School in northern New Jersey, where Mr. Kushner spent long days attending mandatory prayers (morning and afternoon) and studying in English, Hebrew and Aramaic (the language of the Talmud) every year of his education was interwoven with events in Israel. In 1995, when Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin was assassinated, teachers and students mourned together. In 1996, a recent graduate named Sara Duker was killed in another bus bombing, sending shock waves through the school again. In 1997, about the time Mr. Kushner was on a   summer trip to Israel, a double suicide bomb in the main Jerusalem market killed more than a dozen people. But classmates say the environment Mr. Kushner lived in could feel apolitical, because most everyone shared similar views, and Palestinian perspectives were barely considered. Some teachers told students that “Palestinian” was a   identity, a label adopted for political reasons. There was little discussion of what it was like to live under occupation, several classmates of Mr. Kushner’s recalled. Many rabbis and teachers seemed comfortable with settlements, and some students said they never learned that Israel’s borders were a highly contested topic. “There was such an assumption that Jews deserve to have this place, that it was theirs for thousands of years by biblical fiat,” said Eli Schleifer, who graduated the year before Mr. Kushner. “There was such a strange blindness to the complexity of the situation. ” In 1999, Mr. Kushner left New Jersey for Harvard, where he no longer wore a skullcap to classes, but continued to follow rules of Orthodox Jewish life. Jordan Reid Strauch, a friend of Mr. Kushner’s, could not recall his mentioning Israel. Soon the second intifada, or Palestinian uprising, was setting off criticism of Israel on campus and then responses from students who defended the country, but Mr. Kushner kept his head down. Instead he spent time at the Chabad House, where Rabbi Zarchi was struck by how Mr. Kushner “never felt the need to apologize for his differences, his religious commitments,” he said. Mr. Kushner sometimes expressed his views during long Sabbath meals at the house. “He certainly believed that a strong and secure Israel was in America and the world’s best interest,” Rabbi Zarchi said. He didn’t believe that Israel needed “the approval of Europe, the United Nations or even Washington or London,” the rabbi continued. While Mr. Kushner was at Harvard, Mr. Netanyahu once again visited his father, speaking at his office, kicking a soccer ball at one of the schools that carried the family name and sitting down for a tabbouleh lunch with students, including Jared’s younger brother, Joshua. Mr. Netanyahu’s visits helped lead to an unexpected outcome: Charles Kushner’s brother, Murray, sued him for misusing the family company’s funds by paying hundreds of thousands of dollars in speaking fees to the Israeli leader, among other   figures. The suit was eventually settled, but it set off investigations and misdeeds by Charles Kushner that eventually led to a   prison sentence for tax evasion,   and making illegal campaign donations. A few years later, Charles Kushner and Mr. Netanyahu still seemed close: When the Israeli media obtained Mr. Netanyahu’s partly handwritten list of wealthy Americans most likely to fund his party’s primary elections, Mr. Kushner was near the top. Last June in Washington, Yousef   the ambassador of the United Arab Emirates, received an unexpected request from his friend Thomas Barrack Jr. a   businessman and Trump  : Would he meet with Jared Kushner? “What struck me in our first meeting is that he asked a lot of questions and listened,” Mr. Otaiba said. Since then, the two have been in touch, with Mr. Kushner playing the student, asking Mr. Otaiba for his impressions of shifting forces in the Middle East, Syria, Iran, extremism, relationships. Mr. Kushner had become a force in his family’s real estate business, and a member of a synagogue known for a brand of religious Zionism similar to the one he was raised with. He took out loans for the real estate business from Israel’s Bank Hapoalim and almost bought a major Israeli insurance company called Phoenix. Though he had been raised a Democrat, Mr. Kushner endorsed Mitt Romney in the 2012 presidential race, in part because of disappointment with President Barack Obama on Israel. “Rather than strengthen the nation’s relationship with Israel as the Arab world imploded, Mr. Obama treated Jerusalem as less a friend than a burden,” the Observer endorsement read, using language similar to what Mr. Trump would eventually say. Now Mr. Kushner has given up his life in New York for a government ID card and a groaning portfolio. Many foreign policy experts wait their entire careers for a White House job, but Mr. Kushner is fielding inquiries from foreign leaders even as he is still learning to navigate the subject. He is far from the first American Jew with strong ties to Israel to wade into Middle Eastern diplomacy  —   Rahm Emanuel, the former White House chief of staff, is the son of a former Jewish paramilitary fighter  —   but the others were Washington professionals or seasoned negotiators. In his first weeks in the White House, Mr. Kushner has had exchanges with officials from Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Mexico and elsewhere, and greeted King Abdullah II of Jordan, whom he met several years ago on a trip to that country that included the actors Nicole Kidman and Hugh Jackman. It is unclear what shape Mr. Kushner’s role will take, especially as figures like Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson and others in the foreign policy apparatus become engaged in Middle Eastern diplomacy. Some observers see Mr. Kushner as a welcome counter to an unpredictable president and to firebrands like Stephen K. Bannon, the White House strategist, and David M. Friedman, the ambassador designate to Israel. Mr. Kushner “could be a moderate voice,” said Dan Gillerman, Israel’s former ambassador to the United Nations, who got to know Mr. Kushner in New York. “The strange thing is, that    kid may end up being the   in the room. ” Many years after his teenage encounters with Mr. Netanyahu, he may also be in a position to help the Israeli leader, who is facing multiple corruption investigations and   challenges from the right. But Mr. Kushner’s task is formidable. Mr. Netanyahu and Mr. Trump want to set in motion a chain of events that could block Iran, redefine Israel’s relationship with the Arab world and create   peace  —   “the deal that can’t be made,” as Mr. Trump has said. “The prime minister is coming into the meeting with the hope to forge a common policy with the president, and Jared’s role is critical in that,” said Ron Dermer, the ambassador of Israel, with whom Mr. Kushner has been in close contact. “He’s someone who, in my interactions with him, has really been able to deliver. ”	1
888	 Here is the site in question with the article in question being that a girl (claiming she’s a virgin) is claiming a pig raped her one night (ripped her pants off & easily bc she wasn’t wearing panties) impregnating her with a baby pig. She (of course) is refusing a sonogram to find out if in deed there is a “pig baby” in her belly. She says she feels it will come out looking human instead of a mutant pig. She’s claiming no other way possible for her to be pregnant for she’s never been sexually active. Her parents are backing her 100% saying she has promised she’s never been with a boy. I find this story repulsive honestly. The mere story is enough to make you sick to your stomach!! Angie Houston recently told Ellis County News that she expects to give birth to a baby pig.Houston alleges that one night she came home from a night of playing miniature golf and was pounced on and raped by a 400lb boar named Pete.“People think I’m crazy and need mental help because of my story,” Houston said. “They ask how’d the pig get my panties off to mount me? I wasn’t wearing any panties is how! This pig been hot for me for years. Constantly sniffing at my genitals. He’s tried to rape me a hundred times. This is just the first time he successfully got inside me.”	0

338	A woman was arrested on charges of animal cruelty after officials found all the signs that her pit bulls had been used for dog fighting, according to prosecutors in Queens. Huddled in cages inside a garage in Far Rockaway, Queens, the four dogs had torn ears, bruises, broken teeth, puncture wounds and cuts. But it wasn’t just the battered dogs that detectives said confirmed their suspicions. Investigators also found a stockpile of training equipment, like a bloodied “break stick,” a tool commonly used to separate a dog’s clenched jaws, as well as a device known as a slat mill, a   treadmill often used to make fighting animals firm and fleet. The discovery opened a window into the world of how dogs are trained to fight, in particular the murky business of building and selling slat mills and similar devices, which are essentially conveyor belts set on wheels that dogs can run on endlessly. They sell briskly on Facebook and eBay, typically marketed as a great way for a dog to blow off steam. Yet animal cruelty experts and the police say that these machines are the dog fighting world’s open secret and are found and used as evidence in most dog fighting stings nationwide. Some pet owners, manufacturers and veterinarians say that the devices can be a healthy way to strengthen dogs and that they can help produce prize dogs for the somewhat obscure world of canine strength competitions. The machines can be used by any dog, their defenders say, but the avalanche of online instructional videos show overwhelmingly that it is pit bulls  —   the chief breed used in dog fighting  —   doing the running. With brand names like Dogtrotter USA and the Game Changer, the largely homemade machines look something like miniaturized treadmills, but are typically not motorized. Dogs are tethered to an overhead bar and move the belt by running on it. Neither of the companies that make the Dogtrotter or the Game Changer responded to requests for comment. Dogtrotter devices have been recovered in several police operations, according to news reports. At the offices of the Humane Society of the United States in Gaithersburg, Md. Chris Schindler, the director for animal cruelty and fighting prevention, keeps as a teaching tool a slat mill recovered during a sting operation. Owning a running machine or making one hardly means that a person is involved in dog fighting  —   people living in apartments or with limited mobility might find them a practical way to exercise energetic dogs. Dr. Richard Goldstein, the chief medical officer of the Animal Medical Center in Manhattan, said the center used motorized treadmills to rehabilitate patients, adding that the machines must be monitored at all times by trained workers. Nonmotorized treadmills can be a cheaper and safer alternative for pet owners, he said, adding that sled dogs, for example, are often trained on treadmills before races so they can run indoors. “We understand that there is obviously abuse of the techniques to train dogs to strengthen their endurance,” Dr. Goldstein said, “but it is a legitimate tool for training dogs. ” Slat mills are a preferred piece of equipment for dog fighters, said a man who trained and fought pit bulls across the United States for over 20 years, before quitting in 2010 and becoming an informant for animal rights groups and law enforcement. “You can be very discreet with your illegal activity. You can portray it as saying that it’s just exercise equipment,” said the man, who declined to be named because he is an informant. “The reality is, it’s all illegal and it is made to make these dogs fighting machines. ” Experts say there is a strong correlation between fighting and the running tracks commonly sold on the web. “A lot of things can be inhumane in the wrong hands,” Mr. Schindler said. Dog fighting is illegal nationwide, and in 20 states, including New York, possession of slat mills is, too, if there is proof of intent to use them for dog fighting purposes. “You’re not talking just about the mill itself, you’re talking about the totality of the evidence seized, that show this person is involved in dog fighting, which is inherently cruel,” Mr. Schindler said. Randall Lockwood, senior vice president for forensic sciences at the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, said that in the last two years in Baltimore alone, there had been close to 20 dog fighting busts and in nearly all of them a slat mill or similar device was found. “It’s relatively compact, you can keep it in your basement, no one sees you involved in the training, and it can be secretive,” Dr. Lockwood said. “That is why it is one of the preferred pieces of conditioning equipment. ” Slat mills were discovered on the property of Michael Vick, a former professional football player who was convicted in 2007 of running a dog fighting ring on his Virginia estate. A regimen used to condition dogs to fight is called “a keep” and incorporates diets and exercises that differ from trainer to trainer. Many employ some kind of running device. To train a dog to run, the dog is usually confined to a running machine while food or even a live animal is placed just out of reach. Some instructional videos show dogs sprinting on separate mills, pointed at one another. Brian Miller, who breeds Olde English Bulldogges, a slim and powerful bulldog variant, in Holton, Kan. just north of Topeka, runs his dogs on mills that he makes himself and that he markets as Revolution Carpet Mills. Mr. Miller’s dogs enter   competitions, legal Iron   bouts in which dogs haul weights a short distance on their own volition. Running on a carpet mill offers a type of resistance training, he said, and helps his pulling dogs, with names like Static and Smash, build their muscles. When people call to order mills, however, he has learned to listen for certain buzzwords and unusual questions to try to keep them from falling into the wrong hands. They may mention “a keep,” or ask how long a dog can run until exhaustion. “I end the conversation abruptly,” Mr. Miller said. “It is for my own mental and emotional  . ” The woman who has been charged with animal cruelty by Queens prosecutors, Cherise Mickens, 27, had rented a garage in which her dogs were found starving, stacked in metal crates, alongside a slat mill. She faces up to four years in prison if convicted. A lawyer for Ms. Mickens did not respond to a request for comment. Advocacy groups like People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals condemned the discovery and stressed that laws around the running machines should be strengthened. The whole slat mill industry is problematic, the dog fighting informant said. Manufacturers “can’t differentiate between if I’m a dog fighter or not,” he said. “They should be banned in every state and every country. ”	1
163	For days, news reports have noted the presence of a Russian naval ship lurking in international waters off the East Coast of the United States. For some critics of President Trump, the vessel has become a symbol of the administration’s ties with Russia. Mr. Trump himself referred to the ship at a marathon news conference on Thursday, saying that his critics probably think “the greatest thing I could do is shoot that ship that’s 30 miles offshore right out of the water. Everyone in this country’s going to say, ‘Oh, it’s so great.’ That’s not great. That’s not great. ” A Coast Guard official on Thursday said the presence of the intelligence ship, called the Viktor Leonov, so close to American shores is not unprecedented, and is not a cause for alarm. The vessel has been traveling along the Eastern Seaboard and was spotted near the states of Connecticut, Virginia and Delaware. Capt. Andrew Tucci, who oversees Long Island Sound and coastal Connecticut, said the Coast Guard knew the Russian ship had been traveling from the Caribbean “for some time. ” “This vessel was transiting all up the Eastern Seaboard, and the Coast Guard and other military and federal government agencies are aware,” Captain Tucci said. By the time the public learned of it on Wednesday, it had started to move in the direction of a submarine base in Groton, Conn. staying at least 30 miles offshore. Captain Tucci said that his region is traversed mostly by commercial fishing vessels and oceangoing freight ships, but that the Coast Guard had no reason to contact the Russian ship. Asked how often a foreign military ship passes off the U. S. coast, he said, “A couple times a year. ” “It may not be a daily occurrence, but it is not unusual,” he said of the appearance of the Russian vessel. “This vessel was in international waters for the entirety of a transit, so it is not a violation of American sovereignty in any way,” Captain Tucci said. “And yes, Russian vessels transit through international waters,” he added, “and certainly American vessels transit through international waters, and it is a legitimate and lawful activity that doesn’t raise any particular concerns. ” United States territory extends 12 miles out to sea. While the ship was being treated publicly as little more than a maritime curiosity, its presence became entangled in the political discourse. That was especially true after  Michael T. Flynn’s resignation this week as national security adviser amid a scandal over his contact with a Russian diplomat. Mr. Trump, who spent part of the news conference denouncing leaks to the press, later used the ship as an example of a national security matter that he would not discuss with journalists. “So when you ask me what am I going to do with a ship, the Russian ship as an example, I’m not going to tell you,” he said. “But hopefully, I won’t have to do anything, but I’m not going to tell you. ” Earlier in the week, some had seized on the Russian ship as a symbol. Representative Joe Courtney, a Democrat from Connecticut and a member of the Seapower and Projection Forces Subcommittee, said on Wednesday on the House floor and in a statement that the presence of the Russian “spy ship” about 30 miles from the Groton submarine base was one of several “destabilizing” actions by Russia and its president, Vladimir V. Putin. “This unacceptable, aggressive action, combined with the buzzing of U. S. Navy ships in the Black Sea yesterday, are clearly testing the resolve of a new administration,” Mr. Courtney said in the statement on his website. “While I have total confidence in our Navy’s vigilant, responsible readiness, the White House needs to move past their seeming infatuation with Putin and treat him like the serious threat to global peace and security that he has been for the last five years. ” In Congress, the representative said the appearance of the ship fit into a Russian pattern of aggression, including the recent deployment of a new cruise missile that American officials say violated a landmark arms control treaty. “This administration needs to wake up and recognize that and move on to a bipartisan effort to respond to this threat,” Mr. Courtney said. “And they can do that by again disclosing all of the background regarding General Flynn’s interactions with the Russian government, because it is part and parcel of all those incidents which I listed in terms of aggressive actions that are happening in real time as we are here in Washington, D. C. today. ” Though Representative Jim Himes, a Democrat from Connecticut, said in a statement on Wednesday the ship did “not present a direct threat to our physical safety,” he added that its appearance was troubling, however, viewed in conjunction with the stories of “Russian ties and interference in the Trump administration and the recent deployment of a Russian cruise missile in apparent violation of international agreements. He added, “In my opinion, Russia is making a show of strength and pushing established boundaries and norms to gauge the reaction of a new administration in disarray. ” Senator Chris Murphy, a Democrat from Connecticut, said that while the appearance of the Russian ship  was not “wholly unprecedented,” it showed the Trump administration had given Russia the green light to “flex his muscles. ” For years, the   ship, which has equipment monitoring sonar and communications and carries defensive weaponry, has been patrolling near naval installations on the East Coast and was spotted two years ago near the Navy’s Trident ballistic missile submarine base in Kings Bay, Ga. The Hartford Courant newspaper reported. “It’s been going on for years,” said Jeff Walsh, a retired Navy senior chief, who served 22 years aboard attack submarines and who works at Electric Boat in Groton. Mr. Walsh was quoted by the newspaper as saying that the attention roused by the ship was amusing to people who understand the context. “It’s going to keep going on until everyone wants to play nice. ” The Associated Press quoted an unnamed military official as saying the ship had made a port call in Cuba previously and was monitored off Delaware’s coast. It was not immediately clear how long the Russian ship had remained off the Connecticut coast. Captain Tucci said he did not have information about the location of the Russian ship on Thursday. “It came up here, it turned around and left, and to my knowledge the last briefing I got, it was headed back down,” he said.	1
382	Khaled Khatib, a Syrian rescue worker who served as a cinematographer on the   documentary short “The White Helmets,” has been barred by American officials from traveling to Los Angeles for Sunday’s Academy Awards ceremony, according to the Associated Press. The AP reported that the Department of Homeland Security blocked Mr. Khatib after discovering “derogatory information” about him. Mr. Khatib had planned to fly from Istanbul to Los Angeles on Saturday. The AP said he had been detained earlier in the week by Turkish officials for undisclosed reasons, and that he needed a passport waiver to travel to the United States, which was denied. Raed Saleh, the leader of the White Helmets, was also to attend the Oscars there was no indication that his plans were upended. Mr. Khatib had planned to attend the ceremony after the Trump administration’s travel ban was lifted. The ban had halted or slowed travel from seven   countries, including Syria, but it was frozen by the courts. A member of the White Helmets, a group that searches for survivors in the rubble of   buildings, Mr. Khatib also filmed the group’s rescue efforts for the   film, which was made for Netflix and directed by Orlando von Einsiedel. In an interview with The Times earlier this month, Mr. Khatib said he hoped his appearance at the Oscars would convey the urgent message of the movie, and pressure President Bashar  ’s regime and the Russian government to stop bombing Syrian civilians. Representatives for the filmmakers and the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences did not immediately respond to requests for comment.	1

182	The addition of the incendiary   writer Milo Yiannopoulos to Friday’s lineup for the HBO   series “Real Time With Bill Maher” quickly proved controversial on Wednesday evening when another guest, the journalist Jeremy Scahill, said he would not appear on the show because of Mr. Yiannopoulos’s booking. Mr. Scahill, a   and editor of the news site The Intercept,  announced his decision on Twitter only hours after Mr. Yiannopoulos’s scheduled appearance was made public. Mr. Scahill said that allowing Mr. Yiannopoulos to appear on “Real Time” was “many bridges too far. ” “He has ample venues to spew his hateful diatribes,” Mr. Scahill said in a statement. “There is no value in ‘debating’ him. Appearing on ‘Real Time’ will provide Yiannopoulos with a large, important platform to openly advocate his racist,   campaign. It will be exploited by Yiannopoulos in an attempt to legitimize his hateful agenda. ” But Mr. Maher defended his decision. “My comments on Islam have never veered into vitriol,” he said. “Liberals will continue to lose elections as long as they follow the example of people like Mr. Scahill whose views veer into fantasy and away from bedrock liberal principles like equality of women, respect for minorities, separation of religion and state, and free speech. If Mr. Yiannopoulos is indeed the monster Scahill claims  —   and he might be  —   nothing could serve the liberal cause better than having him exposed on Friday night. ” Mr. Yiannopoulos, an editor at Breitbart News, often engages in provocative displays to highlight what he considers the intolerance of the political left. At an appearance in December at the University of   he mocked a transgender student while displaying her photograph during his talk. This month, a planned appearance by Mr. Yiannopoulos at the University of California, Berkeley, was canceled when protests against the speech turned violent and led to rioting that caused around $100, 000 in damages. He had been invited to speak by the school’s College Republicans group. In a Facebook video posted after the speech’s cancellation, Mr. Yiannopoulos said that the “hard left” was to blame, having “become so utterly antithetical to free speech in the last few years. ” “They simply will not allow any speaker on campus, even somebody as silly and harmless and gay as me, to have their voice heard,” he added. Other schools have withdrawn invitations to him in recent weeks. In January, a man was shot during protests outside a speech Mr. Yiannopoulos was giving at the University of Washington in Seattle. Last summer, Mr. Yiannopoulos was barred from Twitter after helping rally other users to direct racist and sexist remarks at Leslie Jones, a star of “Ghostbusters” and “Saturday Night Live. ” Mr. Maher, a comedian who is liberal on many issues  —   he donated $1 million to a “super PAC” supporting President Barack Obama’s   in 2012  —   features guests from across the political spectrum on “Real Time. ” His show on Friday was set to include the comedian Larry Wilmore, the actress Leah Remini and former Representative Jack Kingston, Republican of Georgia.	1
732	 Donald Trump has been dominating the polls for weeks and has shown no sign of slowing down in this Presidential race.So it came as a shock to everyone when he announced that he will be withdrawing from the race this week.“I have never been a fan of politicians and just realized I was slowly becoming my own worst enemy. I’m dropping out of the race to leave a path for others to succeed since I am so awesome that nobody else could have stood a chance against me.”	0
88	PEWAUKEE, Wis.  —   Michelle Roelandts had a question for her congressman: If the Affordable Care Act and its premium subsidies were repealed, what would happen when her daughter turns 26 this year and needs to get her own health insurance while attending law school? Representative Jim Sensenbrenner, a durable Wisconsin Republican who has served in the House since 1979, had little to offer in response. “If I could give you an answer today, I would, but I can’t,” Mr. Sensenbrenner said at a    meeting on Saturday, where about 70 people packed a room at the Pewaukee Public Library. Ms. Roelandts’s question and others like it are being asked with increasing anger and urgency across the country, and Republicans have found themselves on the defensive  —   for all their fury aimed at repealing the law, so far they have not agreed on an alternative. Soon after, a man yelled to Mr. Sensenbrenner: “How many times did you vote to repeal without knowing what the replacement would be? How many times? Dozens!” The congressman, who prides himself on his prolific schedule of    meetings, banged his gavel and insisted that his rules for civility be obeyed. While Mr. Sensenbrenner did not face the kind of anger that some of his peers did in recent days, he must answer the same question: Is this resistance a sign of a sustainable organic movement, or one that will soon flame out? And like his colleagues, he is also coming to grips with how much he will be saddled with the combative comments made by President Trump. Mr. Sensenbrenner, in an interview, attributed the turnout at his gatherings to “organized opposition by people who were on the losing side of the election. ” Facing restive audiences in public meetings is not new, but in the age of social media, an ugly scene in one congressional district can quickly attract widespread attention. “I’d be lying to you if I told you it was fun,” he said. In California, Representative Tom McClintock was escorted by police officers after a    meeting earlier this month in Utah, the crowd chanted “Do your job!” at Representative Jason Chaffetz, the chairman of the Oversight Committee. At a meeting last week, House Republicans were advised on security precautions so they would be prepared for protesters at    meetings or their district offices. The questions from voters on display this weekend at a series of    meetings in Wisconsin’s Fifth Congressional District, many of which were focused on the future of the health care law, underscored the quandary many lawmakers are facing even in solidly Republican districts. The imminent problem: Constituents want answers, and without any consensus on how to go about replacing the law, Republicans have little to say. “It’s kind of like, you know, getting a   jigsaw puzzle for Christmas,” Mr. Sensenbrenner said, “and, you know, cleaning off the dining room table and seeing how long it takes to put all the 30, 000 pieces together in the right place. It’s not going to be easy. ” Mr. Sensenbrenner won   last year by 37 percentage points. His   district, which includes suburbs around Milwaukee, voted decisively for Mr. Trump over Hillary Clinton. At three    meetings over the weekend, Mr. Sensenbrenner sat at the front of the room to take questions from people who submitted slips of paper listing their name and address. When he called on people, he read their names and where they live  —   a practice that makes people “less likely to make fools of themselves,” he said in the interview. At the meetings, he faced crowds that were adversarial but generally civil, and he fielded questions on a range of issues. At moments when the gatherings grew a bit unruly, he did not hesitate to bang his gavel. Like a frustrated   teacher, he offered some unsolicited advice about comportment. “This is not a session on who can cheer or boo the loudest,” he said as he began the Pewaukee meeting on Saturday, urging people to “be respectful of opinions that you do not share. ” The tough questioning of Republican lawmakers has been driven partly by concerns over health care, but also by outrage over Mr. Trump’s presidency. That was true in Wisconsin, too. Mr. Sensenbrenner, who has long worked on immigration issues in Congress, said the executive order on immigration was “completely messed up” and a “train wreck. ” And he suggested he would be of little assistance in reining in Mr. Trump. “Do you think I’m able to control anybody else’s mouth, from the president on down?” he asked. Repeatedly, the questions Mr. Sensenbrenner faced over the weekend showed the challenge that lawmakers have in explaining the effects of repealing the Affordable Care Act, especially now, when Republicans have yet to coalesce around a replacement plan. Pressed by one questioner to oppose a replacement for the health care law if that replacement would raise costs for sick people, he explained that “there are winners and losers” when bills are passed. A woman told him she learned she had skin cancer in 2005, and she asked about coverage for people with   conditions. Another woman told him that her    mother was in a nursing home, and she wondered whether changing Medicaid to give each state a fixed amount of money, called a block grant, could cause her mother to be “put out on the street. ” Leigh Levas, 35, a medical technologist, told him that her    daughter had juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. “I’ve been sending him postcards with her photo, because I think he needs to see the people that it affects,” Ms. Levas said after the Pewaukee meeting. Mr. Sensenbrenner offered a reassurance that some popular aspects of the health care law would remain: insurers would not be able to deny coverage because of   conditions, young adults could stay on their parents’ health plan until they are 26, and lifetime limits on coverage would not be allowed. And he acknowledged the stakes of the repeal effort. “From a political standpoint, we Republicans know that we will own whatever the replacement will be, just as Obama and the Democrats own the A. C. A. ,” he told Ms. Roelandts, who asked about health coverage for her daughter. “We got to get it right, and we got to get it right the first time. ” Ms. Roelandts, an accountant, said later that she was not happy with his answer. “I kind of interpret it as they don’t really know what they’re going to do yet,” she said, adding that she was alarmed by the comparison to a   jigsaw puzzle. “Don’t talk about repealing something until you have valid ideas on the table for replacing it,” she said. “I mean, it’s causing me to literally lose sleep at night. ” Still, Mr. Sensenbrenner was blunt and unapologetic about the Republican push for dismantling President Barack Obama’s signature domestic achievement. “I won by 146, 000 votes,” he said in the interview. “I represent the majority. Now, they’re a vocal minority. ”	1
131	NEW DELHI  —   India’s rapidly worsening air pollution is causing about 1. 1 million people to die prematurely each year and is now surpassing China’s as the deadliest in the world, a new study of global air pollution shows. The number of premature deaths in China caused by dangerous air particles, known as PM2. 5, has stabilized globally in recent years but has risen sharply in India, according to the report, issued jointly on Tuesday by the Health Effects Institute, a Boston research institute focused on the health impacts of air pollution, and the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation, a population health research center in Seattle. India has registered an alarming increase of nearly 50 percent in premature deaths from particulate matter between 1990 and 2015, the report says. “You can almost think of this as the perfect storm for India,” said Michael Brauer, a professor of environment and health relationships at the University of British Columbia and an author of the study, in a telephone interview. He cited the confluence of rapid industrialization, population growth and an aging populace in India that is more susceptible to air pollution. Pollution levels are worsening in India as it tries to industrialize, but “the idea that policy making should be led by government is lacking,” Bhargav Krishna, manager for environmental health at the Public Health Foundation of India, a health policy research center in New Delhi, said in an interview. As air pollution worsened in parts of the world, including South Asia, it improved in the United States and Europe, the report said, crediting policies to curb emissions, among other things. The report’s website that provides    data on pollution levels and the health and mortality effects. Environmental regulations in the United States and actions by the European Commission have led to substantial progress in reducing fine particulate pollution since 1990, the report said. The United States has experienced a reduction of about 27 percent in the average annual exposure to fine particulate matter, with smaller declines in Europe. Yet, some 88, 000 Americans and 258, 000 Europeans still face increased risks of premature death because of particulate levels today, the report said. A fraction of the width of a human hair, these particles can be released from vehicles, particularly those with diesel engines, and by industry, as well as from natural sources like dust. They enter the bloodstream through the lungs, worsening cardiac disease and increasing the risk of stroke and heart failure, in addition to causing severe respiratory problems, like asthma and pneumonia. The report offers good news globally, in some ways. Although deaths caused by air pollution grew to 4. 2 million in 2015 from 3. 5 million in 1990, the rate of increase of about 20 percent was slower than the rate of the population rise during that time. That’s because of improved health care in many parts of the world, as well as public policy initiatives undertaken in the United States, Europe and other regions that reduced emissions from industrialization, the authors of the study said in telephone interviews. China also offers an encouraging sign. Premature deaths from particulate matter each year have stabilized at around 1. 1 million since 2005, the report said. Still, that is an increase of 17 percent since 1990, when it was a little more than 945, 000. The health effects of the ultrafine particles are still being studied and the full effects are only beginning to be understood, said Majid Ezzati, a global environmental health professor at the Imperial College, London. “These studies are hard to do, and isolating the effects of air pollution is hard,” Dr. Ezzati said. “The numbers are still dynamic and nobody should claim an exact number of deaths is known. ” But if he were an Indian citizen, he said, “I’d say, ‘Let’s not sit there and do nothing about it. Let’s not be exposed to it today as more research is being done. ’” Although few studies of the health problems brought by air pollution are based in India, Dr. Ezzati said, “it’s hard to imagine air pollution that is bad for people in London is not bad for people in India. ” Neither India’s environment minister nor its environment secretary could be reached for comment Monday evening. Robert O’Keefe, vice president at the Health Effects Institute, said China’s trajectory on deaths from air pollution had stabilized as a result of the country’s efforts to reduce air pollution. India, on the other hand, had yet to undertake sustained public policy initiatives to reduce pollution, said Gopal Sankaranarayanan, an advocate at the Supreme Court of India who successfully petitioned it to ban licenses to sell fireworks in the New Delhi metropolitan area last year. Fireworks during the festival of Diwali contributed to hazardous levels of air pollution late last year. Weak environmental regulation in India, he said, leaves India’s citizens with few alternatives other than to petition the courts to take action to protect the public’s health. But the courts often lack the power or mechanisms to enforce their actions, he said. India’s environmental court, the National Green Tribunal, ordered farmers to stop burning their crops in the region around New Delhi in 2015, but the practice still continued last year. Smoke from the farm fires contributed about one quarter of the levels of the most dangerous air pollution in the Indian capital, environmental experts said. “If you can’t enforce the directives of the courts  —   it becomes a problem,” Mr. Sankaranarayanan said. “We need practical solutions to save lives here in India. ”	1

866	 The Pope recently shocked supporters and detractors alike with stunning proclamations during a climate change encyclical. For starters, he claimed that the first step in combating climate change is to ease mankind’s carbon footprint by sterilizing all unwed mothers. “If your yard is filled with weeds, you pull the weeds. We have an over-surplus of individuals who are having children at younger and younger ages. These people have nothing of value to impart upon their offspring. They are a burden to society as well as the earth. If a young lady has proved that she is unable to deal with the responsibility of motherhood once, we ought to erase the possibility of it ever happening again.”He continued to elaborate on how overpopulation is the number one factor causing drastic changes in climate. “Childbirth is no longer a sacred event. People are producing out children at an alarming rate and it must end immediately. We spay and neuter our pets, so why do we not perform the same on members of society too irresponsible to be a parent? Why should the children continue to suffer? Why should the world continue to suffer? Why do we keep charging in the same direction, blind to the obvious solution before us? We need to provide for the children who are here at this moment, but we should not bring any more into this world. To do so is to court our own demise.”	0

202	SAN FRANCISCO  —   Facebook’s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, on Thursday stepped into the raging debate about globalization. In a   letter he posted publicly, Mr. Zuckerberg expressed alarm that what was once considered normal  —   seeking global connection  —   was now seen by people and governments around the world as something undesirable. He pledged that he would push Facebook, which has more than 1. 8 billion users worldwide, in a direction that would help convince individuals and governments that “progress now requires humanity coming together not just as cities or nations, but also as a global community. ” The letter comes close to a political statement by a chief executive who, as the leader of a global company, is essentially arguing against a tide of isolationism that is rising across the world. Mr. Zuckerberg, 32, chose to make the statement as an update to his original founder’s letter, which was published in 2012 when Facebook went public. In that letter, he wrote that the social network “was built to accomplish a social mission  —   to make the world more open and connected. ” In an interview this week at the company’s headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif. Mr. Zuckerberg said that when he started Facebook, “the idea of connecting the world was not controversial. ” “The default assumption was that the world was just incrementally moving in that direction,” he said. “Now, that’s actually a real question. ” Mr. Zuckerberg released his missive amid a fierce debate over the merits of globalization. In the United States, President Trump has displayed a deep streak of nationalism. Last year, Britain voted to quit the European Union. Those moves and others have been taken as signs of how globalization has caused strains  —   making it more difficult for companies to navigate a new world order. Against that backdrop, the timing of the letter is notable. While other technology executives, including Jeff Bezos of Amazon and Larry Page and Sergey Brin of Google, regularly update their founder letters each year  —   often tied to financial results  —   it is the first time Mr. Zuckerberg has refreshed Facebook’s mission statement since the company’s initial public offering. Mr. Zuckerberg said his reasons for writing the updated letter began to take shape before last year’s presidential election, spurred by broader trends. He said he recognized that more people were feeling left behind by globalization, and by societal and technological changes. As a result, he wanted to focus different parts of Facebook in a way that helped people better come together. “We have to build a global community that works for everyone,” he said. “I really don’t have much doubt that this is the right direction to go in the long term. ” Mr. Zuckerberg said he planned to reorient Facebook, which turned 13 this month, around these new realities. His letter is filled with abstract ideas, including the notion of “social infrastructure” and how to create stronger online communities, with few detailed steps about how to realize those goals. One top priority is building inclusive online communities that are supportive, safe and informed environments, to help strengthen bonds in the offline world as well. Mr. Zuckerberg also stressed the idea of using Facebook to create this “social infrastructure”  —   essentially a digital means of connecting people around shared interests  —   mirroring social groups in the physical world like churches, governments and unions. That may encourage connections among people that transcend national and international barriers, he said. While Mr. Zuckerberg mentioned several concrete steps that Facebook has taken toward some of these goals, he gave few other specifics. He did not address how his vision might conflict with those of political leaders around the world, nor did he mention how emphasizing global connections benefited Facebook’s finances. Getting to this point did not come easily. Since going public, Facebook has been on a growth tear, becoming one of the world’s biggest and most valuable public entities. Yet the power that Facebook has amassed has raised hackles globally. The social network is blocked in China, has stumbled in India and is facing a thicket of regulatory questions in Europe. More recently, Mr. Trump’s election prompted an outcry over whether Facebook influenced the American electorate with false stories on its site. The company has scrambled to contain the fallout, undertaking several experiments to better sort through what people see on its site. A key moment for Mr. Zuckerberg’s shift in thinking about how to be a global company happened six months ago. In September, Facebook censored an iconic photograph that featured a naked    girl fleeing napalm bombs during the Vietnam War. Mr. Zuckerberg said the image, titled “The Terror of War,” was rightly censored by Facebook at the time because the company’s content policies did not allow child nudity. Facebook users disagreed, arguing that the photograph was not titillating but rather illustrated the perils of modern warfare. The social network eventually allowed the image to be posted on its site, noting that it had inherent news value. Mr. Zuckerberg said the episode made him realize how ineffective Facebook’s content policy was at a global scale, given that cultural norms vary greatly by country. He said Facebook needed to get to a place in which users could perhaps choose their own content policies based on local laws and preferences, a marked departure from the company’s blanket global approach of the past decade or more. “I don’t think that we, sitting here in California, are best positioned to know what the norms in communities around the world should be,” Mr. Zuckerberg said. “At some point, you just need a more dynamic system where people can just express that themselves. ” Mr. Zuckerberg spent much of his letter focused on the importance of personal relationships. He pointed to “very meaningful groups”  —   Facebook groups that people frequently engage in and return to  —   that are often centered on topics like parenting, sports or other shared interests. When people find an interest they are passionate about and form such a group, they are some of the most tightly connected relationships on Facebook, he said. To foster more of these groups in a safe way, Mr. Zuckerberg said Facebook needed to change some of the ways that it operated. That includes improving community safety with product updates similar to Facebook’s “safety check,” a tool that lets people mark themselves safe during catastrophes. Mr. Zuckerberg said that governments regularly called Facebook to confirm that Safety Check was activated during crises like the massacre at a nightclub in Florida last year. Mr. Zuckerberg also emphasized Facebook’s role in keeping communities   which will necessitate tackling misinformation and highly polarized news. He alluded to Facebook’s shifting role as a distributor of news, saying the social network is “not just technology or media. ” Facebook’s goal, Mr. Zuckerberg said, was not to usurp traditional institutions like governments, religious groups and other communities that share interests. (When asked if he wanted to run for president of the United States, he laughed and declined.) Instead, he said, creating tightly knit online groups would make these traditional institutions stronger. It also would not hurt that such groups and connections could well make Facebook more essential to people, which in turn may increase the company’s profits. “There’s a social infrastructure that needs to get built to deal with modern problems in order for humanity to get to the next level,” Mr. Zuckerberg said. “I just think it would be good if more people thought about things like this. ”	1
206	An   police sergeant in Missouri has filed a discrimination lawsuit against his employer, alleging that he was told he would not be promoted unless he toned down his “gayness. ” The sergeant in the St. Louis County Police Department, Keith Wildhaber, said that over the years his performance reviews have said he “exceeds standards” or is “superior” in all categories. But in 2014, the suit says, after Sgt. Wildhaber became one of nine top candidates eligible to move up to lieutenant, he and another officer, who had disciplinary and performance issues, were the only ones denied promotion. That same year, the lawsuit says, the sergeant was told by John Saracino, a member of the St. Louis County Board of Police Commissioners, which supervises the department, that the command staff “has a problem with your sexuality. ” “If you ever want to see a white shirt (i. e. get a promotion) you should tone down your gayness,” Mr. Saracino said, according to the suit. Mr. Saracino could not be reached by telephone on Friday. But he told The St. Louis   which reported on the suit: “I never had a conversation like that. I would never say anything like that. That’s not me. ” The lawsuit, filed on Jan. 10 in Circuit Court, names St. Louis County as a defendant and seeks compensation, back pay, promotion and other damages. Sgt. Wildhaber was hired by the Police Department as a security officer in 1994 after he served for four years in the Army, according to the lawsuit. He attended the Police Academy, became a patrolman in 1997 and rose through the ranks. He became a detective in 2006 and a sergeant in 2011, the lawsuit says. He was given a Medal of Valor for saving a man trapped in a burning car in a commuter parking lot in November 1998, when he was still a rookie, according the St. Louis  . Last April, Sgt. Wildhaber filed a discrimination complaint with the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and the Missouri Commission on Human Rights, alleging employment discrimination based on his sex or gender, the lawsuit says. A month later, he was transferred to a different precinct and put on night shift. The suit says St. Louis County believes that Sgt. Wildhaber “does not fit the stereotypical norms of what a ‘male’ should be” and it has “failed to take any action to investigate or take corrective action” in response to his multiple complaints. Sgt. Wildhaber could not be reached by telephone or email on Friday, but his lawyer, Russell C. Riggan, said in an email, “Until the case goes before a jury, we will allow the petition to speak for itself. ” A spokeswoman for St. Louis County, Allison Blood, referred questions to a Police Department spokesman, Sgt. Shawn McGuire. He did not immediately reply to a voice mail message on Friday.	1

992	 A former student of the acclaimed physicist and author, Stephen Hawking, is accusing the famed scientist of sexual assault in 1994. The accuser, Gabrielle J.

372	SAN FRANCISCO  —   Sitting in a basement office that she rents by the hour, Shannon Coulter ticks off the activities she gave up in defiance of President Donald J. Trump: renting movies with her husband on Amazon, and shopping at Nordstrom, Macy’s and other retailers that sell Ivanka Trump’s products. A Nordstrom bag sat on a nearby table. It represents a victory lap of sorts for Ms. Coulter, who has almost   spearheaded a retail revolt against the president and his family. She was wearing a new silver Elizabeth and James lariat necklace purchased at the department store soon after it scrubbed Ms. Trump’s name from its website. “The goal,” Ms. Coulter said, “came originally from a place of really wanting to shop the stores we loved again with a clear conscience. ” It’s been a wild ride these past few months for Ms. Coulter, who runs her shoestring movement from her home, or from cheerfully decorated work spaces like this one  —   surrounded by   furniture, clam chairs and decorative pillows that feel more Silicon Valley than   war room. Enraged by a video that emerged last October of Mr. Trump bragging about sexually assaulting women, Ms. Coulter began a boycott of any sort of product connected to Mr. Trump. At first, it was just a tweet  —   a list she had compiled of companies that sold Trump products  —   but the ember quickly turned into a    blaze. Thousands of people have contacted the stores Ms. Coulter has on her boycott list, including Macy’s and Amazon. Retailers including Nordstrom, Neiman Marcus and T. J. Maxx have backed away from products connected to Ms. Trump, the president’s oldest daughter, since Ms. Coulter’s efforts began. A herd of activists and celebrities, including the feminist writer Gloria Steinem, the Olympic diver Greg Louganis and the actress Lucy Lawless of “Xena: Warrior Princess,” have expressed support. The attention has transformed Ms. Coulter, 45, a digital marketing specialist, into the unlikely general of the digital army now supporting her campaign, Grab Your Wallet. “People describe me as an activist in media coverage, I don’t know who they’re talking about,” she said. “I’ve never done anything this organized or structured or purposeful. ” The new role has taken up much of her time, and has made her the target of criticism and attacks from Trump supporters. She’s lost count of how many times she has been called a “bully” or a “disgrace. ” The abuse gets more menacing with each victory a recent email included her mother’s name in the subject line, with threats to publish more of her personal information. In the latest twist, the boycott has drawn Ms. Coulter, a   progressive liberal, into a growing debate over whether targeting Ms. Trump is sexist. And she said she worries that people will think she is profiting from the venture. Ms. Coulter was particularly upset when a knockoff “Grab Your Wallet” group sold clothing and other merchandise on Facebook. “We don’t even have a   we don’t have stickers, nothing,” she said, adding that she does not accept compensation from companies, or donations. “I don’t think either of us envisioned that some of the things that have happened would happen,” said Sue Atencio, who helped Ms. Coulter get the site started. In many ways, Ms. Coulter has embraced her new position. She answers emails at all hours and scours Twitter for tips on companies to add, or remove, from the boycott list. Then there are the phone calls  —   lots and lots of phone calls  —   from angry Trump supporters or journalists or the companies that want to get off her list. There is no doubt that it has changed her life. She doesn’t sleep or socialize as often as she used to. Most of her work on Grab Your Wallet is done after she eats dinner with her husband, taking up what free time she has. “She went underground, basically,” said Amie Penwell, a fellow San Francisco resident who hasn’t seen much of her friend of seven years recently. The negative attention has made Ms. Coulter careful about her privacy. She insisted on meeting at the work space for an interview, to avoid having a reporter at her home, out of fear that it could be targeted. She would not let her husband, whom she met online in 2010, be interviewed. Born in Indiana, Ms. Coulter studied journalism at Penn State. She said she began her career by “piggybacking” on the Bay Area’s technology boom, helping   with their email marketing. A year ago she started her own agency, DoubleKnown, which helps executives and small businesses build their online presence through blog posts, social media feeds and other digital tools. The company has one other employee and a handful of education and technology clients, but has stopped taking on new accounts since Grab Your Wallet took off. Political activism has not been a big part of Ms. Coulter’s life since college, when she spoke at a rally raising awareness about violence against women. Her most recent organized effort came after the shooting at Umpqua Community College in Oregon in 2015, when she circulated a list of lawmakers who had voted against tougher gun control measures. “Maybe that gave me a taste of what something like this would be like,” she said, describing herself as a chronic list maker. “I like the efficiency of them. ” After becoming incensed by the video, Ms. Coulter began searching retailers’ websites for   products and collecting the names on a spreadsheet. Wondering who else might be interested in a boycott, she looked at Twitter, and found Ms. Atencio, who had tweeted “fashion not fascism. ”Ms. Coulter contacted her and suggested they announce the boycott together. Since then, most of the work has fallen to Ms. Coulter, though she refers to Ms. Atencio as her “spiritual guide” and sounding board. Ms. Atencio, 59, sees herself as the less visible half of a musical duo. “I feel like I’m the Garfunkel and Shannon is Paul Simon,” Ms. Atencio said. Grab Your Wallet now includes a list of places to shop and not shop, and a short script for people who want to call companies to complain. As many as 32, 000 people visit her site in an hour, Ms. Coulter said. When the women’s marches took place across the country in January, 350, 000 people arrived during a   period. In early February, Nordstrom and Neiman Marcus removed Ms. Trump’s name from their websites. Employees at T. J. Maxx and Marshalls were instructed not to display Ivanka Trump products and to throw her signs in the trash. None of the retailers credited Grab Your Wallet with their decision  —   the department stores blamed poor sales  —   and it is not possible to know to what degree Ms. Coulter and her followers have influenced the companies’ decision making. But in the waning days of January,   complaints, many of which mentioned Grab Your Wallet, were Nordstrom’s most common customer feedback, according to a person with direct knowledge who was not authorized to speak publicly. Nordstrom said it did not have “specific numbers” on the number of customers it had heard from. “I attribute it directly to the Muslim ban,” Ms. Coulter said, referring to the executive order on immigration that Mr. Trump issued on Jan. 27. “I can see when the numbers spike when certain news events happen. ” Monitoring those spikes, updating her list and responding to emails, tweets and press inquiries have become Ms. Coulter’s second   job. “My life is so completely here,” she said, gesturing to her MacBook, “that it all just sort of overlaps and is an endless stream of emails and tweets and Facebook posts. ” She does get some help from volunteers, like the woman who helps run the legitimate Grab Your Wallet Facebook group, which has more than 12, 000 members. But for the most part, Ms. Coulter is on her own. That means the threats and negative attention are also directed largely at her. People ask her why she’s “attacking another woman,” or call her a bully. People like the Fox host Jeanine Pirro have argued that Ms. Trump’s brand has nothing to do with the White House, and that she is being unjustly targeted. Defenders also point to a proposed maternity policy that Ms. Trump developed with her father’s campaign, and her brand’s hashtag, WomenWhoWork, as examples of how she promotes women. “We have to stop destroying women based on the men in their lives,” Ms. Pirro said during a recent episode of her show. S. E. Cupp, a conservative author and commentator, stopped short of calling the boycott of Ms. Trump’s products sexist. But in an email, Ms. Cupp said that it seemed “misdirected. ” “I’m never a fan of going after the kids, grown or not, of presidents,” she said. “Nor does it feel consistent with the   argument  —   that he’s ‘ ’  —   to economically punish his daughter, a working wife and mother. ” A spokesman for Ms. Trump’s brand declined to make someone at the company available for an interview. In a statement, the company said it had been “swept into the political fray, becoming collateral damage in others’ efforts to advance agendas unrelated to what we do. ” Ms. Coulter finds such comments perplexing. She pointed out that Ms. Trump moved to Washington and has taken on an informal advisory role in the White House. She frequently sits in on her father’s meetings with foreign leaders. Ms. Trump’s husband, the real estate developer Jared Kushner, is a top adviser to President Trump. In addition, Ms. Coulter said, Ms. Trump played a prominent role in the presidential campaign. “Someone who passionately campaigned for a man who likes to grab women by the genitals will never convince me that she’s on the side of women,” she said. “Ever. ” Ms. Steinem also said that Ms. Trump was fair game, particularly after the election, when it can no longer be argued that she is just doing her “filial duty” on the campaign trail. “It’s appropriate to boycott her not because he is her father,” Ms. Steinem said, “but because she supports his policies. ” Ms. Steinem specifically faulted Ms. Trump’s proposed   policy for its exclusion of fathers and   mothers. Despite the long hours, Ms. Coulter said she could continue running Grab Your Wallet indefinitely. She’s considering turning the campaign into a nonprofit and running it full time, and is struggling to figure out what to do with her fledgling business. “I’m trying to understand what the right next step is,” she said. “I think as long as he’s in office, this will be alive. ”	1
196	LOS ANGELES  —   First came the anxious calls in the days after the election of President Trump. Now, people begin lining up before 8 a. m. and crowd the waiting rooms inside the Mexican Consulate here. Mexican citizens come to renew passports that have been unused for more than a decade. They desperately ask lawyers if they can do anything to help them stay in the United States. They register their children for Mexican citizenship, just in case they are sent back and decide to move their whole family with them. When the consulate began to get reports of dozens of Mexicans being arrested by immigration officials last week, they immediately dispatched lawyers to the federal detention center downtown. Officers closely monitored social media, simultaneously trying to get information and quash unfounded rumors. In one case, they helped a man whom immigration officials had quickly sent to the border for deportation return to Los Angeles for a hearing in immigration court. These are demanding times for the 50 Mexican consulates scattered throughout the United States. With Mr. Trump’s promise to crack down on immigrants living in the United States illegally and an executive order that vastly expands who is considered a priority for deportation, Mexicans living here illegally are increasingly on edge. And consulates are moving quickly to help. As official representatives of the Mexican government in the United States, the consulates can provide legal guidance and resources for people and families dealing with immigration issues. Mexicans make up about half of the country’s 11 million undocumented immigrants. The relationship between Mexico and the United States is at its lowest point in years. After a    mother of two American citizens was deported in Arizona last week, the Mexican government warned their citizens living in the United States of a “new reality. ” It urged “the entire Mexican community” to “take precautions” and be in touch with the nearest consulate. Mexican officials say they are eager to keep families already living in the United States together. There are economic concerns too: Mexicans living abroad send more than $25 billion back home, with most of the money coming from the United States, according to Mexico’s central bank. Perhaps nobody is as busy as Carlos García de Alba, the consul general in Los Angeles, one of the largest offices in the country. He has begun to train nearly every employee in basic legal services and expects to bring in many more immigration lawyers. Still, in recent months, Mr. García has felt torn between his efforts to increase services to worried constituents and trying to calm their nerves. “We don’t want to provoke and feed a kind of paranoia among our nationals here,” Mr. García said in an interview. “There is a kind of psychosis, people are really scared. Up to now we haven’t seen anything that is really different than the last several years, but the environment is making people panic and they are completely fearful. They want to know what is going to happen and how to protect themselves. ” In the last week, the Mexican government has created a   hotline to help answer any questions for Mexicans in the United States. Last month, Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto announced that he would spend $50 million to pay for lawyers at every consulate to help people facing deportations. And consulates have been distributing fliers detailing what to do if someone is approached by deportation agents  —   advising them not to open their doors without proof of a warrant or speak to officers without a lawyer. Foreign service officers who have spent decades in the United States said in interviews that they had all encountered increased anxiety among undocumented immigrants, as several states have passed their own laws to deal with illegal immigration. But they said this was the most hostile national atmosphere for Mexicans in recent memory, making their jobs both more difficult and more urgent. Scared by rumors and rhetoric, some consulates have heard of immigrants taking drastic steps to avoid the authorities, like keeping their children home from school, quitting their jobs or selling their homes for cash. And many immigrants may not immediately consider turning to the Mexican government for help. “There is an inherent feeling of vulnerability that comes with being undocumented in this country, and that vulnerability moves you to get away of anything that is official government,” said Carlos González Gutiérrez, the consul general in Austin, Tex. who estimates that about half of the 200, 000 Mexicans living in the region are undocumented. “The first challenge for us is to make sure that immigrants understand that the consulate is a safe place where they can get accurate information. ” Like other consuls, Mr. González has tried to assuage fears by appearing frequently on   television and radio, offering information that American officials may not be willing to share. He has been careful to emphasize that the operations appeared to be targeted, not widespread raids as some feared, but also pointed out that several people without criminal records had also been arrested. Many of the consulates’ most pressing concerns now are defensive. In several cases last week, immigration agents were “unwilling to provide our nationals with the option to talk with our consulate and the obligation to notify us,” said one Mexican official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the issue was still under investigation. Under the Vienna Convention, a 1963 international treaty, any citizen of another country should be offered a chance to speak with their consulate. Felipe Carrera oversees the department of protection in the Los Angeles consulate, where dozens of lawyers assist with immigration cases. For years, the office has sent a lawyer to the federal immigration center daily, monitoring who is taken in and talking to as many as 15 people a day. Minutes after he heard reports of dozens of arrests last week, several lawyers went there to talk with as many Mexicans as they could. “Our main purpose is to find out if there have been violations of due process,” Mr. Carrera said. “People need to know they have constitutional rights. We want them to know about the Fifth Amendment and make sure they are properly advised about what happens if they plead guilty. ” Claudia Franco, the consul general in Phoenix, said much of her time these days was spent offering a kind of psychological support to immigrants, answering basic questions and calmly listening to their fears. “We want people to consider   scenarios, to be prepared and have a plan,” she said. The    national hotline, based in Tucson, received more than 1, 500 calls one day this week, more than double than the average number of calls before Mr. Trump was inaugurated. Consulates throughout the country said requests for legal assistance had also spiked in the last two months  —   some come from people who received deportation orders years ago that were never enforced. Others have criminal convictions for using fake Social Security cards still others may be eligible for special visas because they were victims of domestic abuse or other crimes. “Most people do not understand what their legal options are,” said Javier Díaz de León, the consul general in Atlanta. “There are a number of people who don’t really have a legal recourse, but it’s much more preferable to know that before you get detained so you can make a wise decision. ” While many people are looking for advice have plans to stay here, many parents of   children are now registering them for Mexican citizenship  —   a kind of insurance in case they are deported and want their children to join them. The Mexican government has offered this kind of dual citizenship for more than a decade. Before the election, Mr. Díaz said, the office handled about 15 applications a day, now they receive double that. Other offices have experienced similar increases. Monica Sanchez, 26, came to Los Angeles from Morelia, Mexico, more than 10 years ago. Although she has stayed out of legal trouble, she said she was constantly worried that things would change quickly and she would be forced to move back. “I want to do something, whatever I can do to feel safer and less scared,” she said. “We all want help to take the control we can get, to have some power. ”	1
914	 Egypt’s Antiquities Ministry announced this morning that a team of underwater archaeologists had discovered that remains of a large Egyptian army from the 14th century BC, at the bottom of the Gulf of Suez, 1.5 kilometers offshore from the modern city of Ras Gharib. The team was searching for the remains of ancient ships and artefacts related to Stone Age and Bronze Age trade in the Red Sea area, when they stumbled upon a gigantic mass of human bones darkened by age.The scientists lead by Professor Abdel Muhammad Gader and associated with Cairo University’s Faculty of Archaeology, have already recovered a total of more than 400 different skeletons, as well as hundreds of weapons and pieces of armor, also the remains of two war chariots, scattered over an area of approximately 200 square meters. They estimate that more than 5000 other bodies could be dispersed over a wider area, suggesting that an army of large size who have perished on the site.

152	In “Natasha, Pierre  the Great Comet of 1812,” a rock opera on Broadway adapted from a section of Leo Tolstoy’s “War and Peace,” Amber Gray and Lucas Steele play Hélène and Anatole Kuragin, a pair of   aristocratic siblings who are impervious to consequence and impossibly chic in their punk romantic  . In other words, they were perfect casting for New York Fashion Week  —  presuming they could get seats to a show. A reporter’s initial plan was to take them to Raf Simons’s debut at Calvin Klein, but with just 400 seats in the house and no   Calvin Klein available for them to wear, the request was declined. They almost didn’t get into Tory Burch either, until Ms. Burch and her team agreed to dress Ms. Gray and seat her with Mr. Steele in the front row at her show Tuesday morning, which took place at the Whitney Museum in Lower Manhattan. (The company doesn’t have a men’s line and therefore couldn’t outfit Mr. Steele). Had so few people in the fashion industry read the rapturous reviews in The New York Times, Variety and The Hollywood Reporter? Or could it be the source material? If it was the latter, Ms. Gray could hardly blame them. She hadn’t read the classic novel when she and Mr. Steele debuted as the scheming siblings in in its first Off Broadway production in 2012. “When I first picked the book up, I cheated and just read the   section the show is based on,” Ms. Gray said, upon arriving at the Whitney in a burgundy leather jacket from AllSaints, along with a smart looking Tory Burch   guipure lace Carolina dress and ’  ankle boots from Ms. Burch. Mr. Steele wore his own vintage black leather jacket, with a borrowed burgundy and black   shirt, borrowed black slacks and borrowed black and red loafers from AllSaints. Behind them was a stylist named Michael Fusco. “He’s here to make sure we don’t look like morons,” Mr. Steele said with a glance, as Mr. Fusco adjusted his jacket collar. On their way into the museum, they ran into the veteran magazine editor and critic Hal Rubenstein, whom Mr. Steele had met over the summer at a charity gala. “I was at your benefit,” Mr. Steele said. “I saw your show,” Mr. Rubenstein said. “It was a wonderful evening. ” A few minutes later, a nervous Mr. Steele and Ms. Gray were introduced to Anna Wintour, who had seen it, too. “I saw it! I loved it,” Ms. Wintour said, going on to marvel at how gloriously “awful” their characters managed to be. In their   seats, the duo chatted about what it has been like to take part in a show that started small before settling at the Imperial Theater in Times Square. Both actors said they struggled for years before being cast in an early production of “The Great Comet” in 2012. Ms. Gray, who is 35 and lives in   Brooklyn, with her boyfriend and young son, worked over the years for the jewelry company Dinosaur Designs. Mr. Steele, who lives in Harlem and is unmarried, did everything from being a nanny to manning sample sales. (Although he is in his 30s, he asked that his age not be printed). Given the quirky format of the show, neither saw its ultimate commercial viability as  . The 2012 production took place in a faux supper club, broke the fourth wall and featured   dance numbers and progressive casting choices, which is how Ms. Gray (who is black) and Mr. Steele (who is white) ended up playing biological siblings. The audience often got inebriated and unruly, Ms. Gray said. ”There was a little groping of the ladies,” she said. “And there was the famous incident when someone threw a cellphone,” Mr. Steele said, referring to the time in 2013 when Kevin Williamson, a writer from National Review, earned plaudits among the cast for taking the device of a texting seatmate and hurling it into the distance. Yet here they were five years later, being photographed by the fashion paparazzi, still not exactly famous but not anonymous either. Around 9:30 a. m. the muslin came up and the models began their march. Roxy Music blared and Ms. Gray joked with Mr. Steele, who noted the similarities to the opulence of the models and their characters in “The Great Comet. ” “They’re all Kuragins,” she said. Like all fashion shows, it was considerably shorter than a Russian novel. Ten minutes later, the pair headed over to meet Ms. Burch, who was holding court in a corner with a gaggle of editors. “Thank you so much for coming,” Ms. Burch said, before apologizing for not having yet been to see them on Broadway. The three posed for pictures, and then Ms. Gray and Mr. Steele exited onto the street and walked over to the nearby Standard Hotel for avocado toast. “There’s no dairy in it, right?” Mr. Steele asked the waiter. Although “The Great Comet” has been on Broadway just two months, Ms. Gray and Mr. Steele have each performed it more than 400 times in its various incarnations. Both said that next fall might be a good time for them to leave. Mr. Steele has had surgery and extensive physical therapy that he attributes to all the   he does in the show. It also gets exhausting, he said, playing one of those people who “peaked in high school. ” Ms. Gray seemed more upbeat. Before departing the restaurant shortly before 11 a. m. she recalled some advice she got early in her career: “If you stand in line long enough, you will get served. ”	1
44	When Republicans in Kentucky seized total control of the state government last year, Damon Thayer, the majority leader in the State Senate, began asking around for advice from counterparts in other capitals where the party already dominated both the legislative and executive branches. How should we handle all this power? he wanted to know. One answer impressed him, Mr. Thayer said, from a senior Republican lawmaker in Wisconsin: “Move quickly. ” Kentucky Republicans have done just that, swiftly passing laws to roll back the powers of labor unions and restrict access to abortion. But they are only getting started, Mr. Thayer said in an interview: They also plan to make sweeping changes to the education and public pension systems this year. And they have plenty of company. While Republicans in Washington appear flummoxed by the complexities of   rule, struggling with issues from repealing the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, to paying for President Trump’s promised wall on the Mexican border, rising party leaders in the states seem far more at ease and assertive. Republicans have    control in 25 states now, holding both the governorship and the entire legislature, and Republican lawmakers are acting with lightning speed to enact longstanding conservative priorities. In states from New England to the Midwest and across the South, conservative lawmakers have introduced or enacted legislation to erode union powers and abortion rights, loosen gun regulations, expand   programs and slash taxes and spending. State Senator Scott L. Fitzgerald of Wisconsin, the Republican majority leader, said conservatives in the states had taken the party’s national victories in November as a directive to “shake up” government. “That has been amped up as a result of Donald Trump being elected president,” he said. “There’s a higher expectation now. ” If Republicans in the states have taken Mr. Trump as an inspiration, in some respects they are also largely unburdened by his personality and his political whims. Republicans in Congress are plainly struggling to overcome deep internal disagreements and to balance traditional conservative goals with Mr. Trump’s distinctive priorities. But for Republicans in state capitals, these are comparatively remote considerations. Some Democrats fear that while their own party is consumed nationally with fighting Mr. Trump, leaders and activists may be too distracted to throw up effective roadblocks to the ideological agenda that Republicans are ramming through at the state level. “Progressives cannot afford to forget about what’s happening in our backyards,” said Nick Rathod, executive director of State Innovation Exchange, a   liberal group focused on state legislatures. “Some of it is even more egregious than what is currently happening in Washington, D. C. ” Republicans have gained power rapidly in the states since the 2008 presidential election, winning 33 governorships and in many instances entrenching themselves in power through legislative redistricting. Riding to office on a wave of discontent with the Obama administration, headstrong governors in states like Wisconsin and Ohio embarked on a ferocious quest to transform their states, repeatedly battling powerful unions and popular backlash. Sidelining Democratic lawmakers and grinding down liberal interest groups, these Republicans may have helped pave the way for Mr. Trump’s victories in a string of traditionally blue Midwestern states last year. Acting fastest at the moment, though, are four states where Republicans won total control of the government only in November. In addition to Kentucky, Missouri and New Hampshire became   states with the election of Republican governors, and Republicans in Iowa snatched away the State Senate, where Democrats had held their last grip on power. In all four states, Republicans are racing to strip back the influence of labor unions, a key Democratic constituency. In Missouri, where union membership has waned, Gov. Eric Greitens, a telegenic former member of the Navy SEALs, signed a “right to work” bill into law on Monday, denying unions the power to require that workers at companies they represent pay dues or their equivalent as a condition of employment. In Kentucky, Gov. Matt Bevin signed a similar measure in January, along with the repeal of a law that kept wages high on public construction projects. And in New Hampshire, State Senator Jeb Bradley, the Republican majority leader, said      legislation was a top priority. In Iowa, Republican leaders announced this past week that they would pursue sweeping changes to the collective bargaining rights of public employees. State Senator Bill Dix, the new Republican majority leader, said his party had campaigned on such changes  —   which would cut deeply into unions’ negotiating power  —   and intended to make good on its commitments. He said Republicans would also seek to change state laws governing health care and to enshrine in the State Constitution the right to bear arms. “Iowans expect us to take action,” Mr. Dix said. His counterpart in New Hampshire, Mr. Bradley, a former member of Congress, echoed that language, but cautioned in an interview that Republicans had to move deliberately and not just fast. “We can’t just start bonfires that we can’t put out,” he warned. “But we can certainly move forward with a conservative agenda that’s a reasonable conservative agenda. ” Democrats and labor unions, which in the past have been able to thwart conservative legislation with the help of a supportive governor or a bloc of allies in the legislature, describe the onslaught in newly Republican states as overwhelming. “They’re killing us here in the state of Missouri,” said John Stiffler, executive   of the St. Louis Building  Construction Trades Council. Some unions in the state, shut out of power, are attempting to put the      law up for a direct vote in a 2018 referendum. For the moment, Mr. Stiffler said, union leaders are seeking to meet with Mr. Greitens in the hope of finding a compromise on other policies, like   legislation. “We’re trying to find a way to get even a small audience with him,” Mr. Stiffler said of Mr. Greitens. The Republican agenda in the states goes well beyond limiting unions. Party leaders in Kentucky, New Hampshire and Missouri have signaled that they plan to expand   and charter school programs and, in some instances, to pursue tort reform and to place new regulations on voting. Beleaguered Democrats see each policy as devised to undercut one of their core political constituencies: teachers, trial lawyers, minority voters or young people. In several states that the party has controlled for a longer span, Republican governors have also announced aggressive plans to overhaul the size and functions of government, including a Wisconsin   proposal, backed by Gov. Scott Walker, and a large program of tax cuts in Florida, championed by Gov. Rick Scott. Both men were first elected in 2010. Republicans in a number of states are also pushing a deeply conservative social agenda. In New Hampshire, Mr. Bradley had long been pushing a bill to let people carry concealed guns without a permit repeatedly, it passed both legislative houses only to be vetoed by Gov. Maggie Hassan, a Democrat. “We had no chance of overriding her veto,” lamented the   Mr. Bradley, but Ms. Hassan was elected to the Senate in November. The gun bill cleared the legislature again on Thursday, and the new Republican governor, Chris Sununu, has “every intention of signing it,” David Abrams, a spokesman of his, said. In Kentucky last month, Mr. Bevin, 50, an activist with close ties to the Tea Party, signed a set of new restrictions on abortion, banning the procedure after 20 weeks and requiring that every woman who seeks an abortion undergo an ultrasound first. Iowa Republicans have advanced a bill to defund Planned Parenthood Missouri legislators have filed a barrage of   bills, including one that would ban the procedure entirely, in defiance of the Supreme Court. In a handful of states including Missouri and Texas, lawmakers are considering legislation that would designate public restrooms and locker rooms as  . And as Mr. Trump attempts to crack down on “sanctuary cities” at the national level, lawmakers in states like Texas and Tennessee have proposed measures to force municipalities to enforce federal immigration law more assertively. Democrats and their allies, including groups like Planned Parenthood, often have little recourse in these states but to rally popular outcry and organize for the next election, or to challenge   policies in court. They have succeeded from time to time, including in North Carolina last year, ousting a Republican governor, Pat McCrory, who signed legislation gutting   protections for gay and transgender people. In 2013, Virginia voters broke a Republican monopoly by electing a Democratic governor, Terry McAuliffe, who campaigned in part against abortion restrictions passed by a   legislature. And in   Louisiana, voters elected a Democratic governor, John Bel Edwards, in 2015, to succeed the unpopular Bobby Jindal, who pursued a   agenda and briefly ran for president. Mr. McAuliffe, one of a growing number of Democrats who have called on the national party to devote more attention to state elections, said Democrats should recognize the role governors play in heading off the kind of conservative legislation they find deeply offensive. Mr. McAuliffe, who has used his veto pen 71 times, said Virginia Republicans had pushed “nuttier, more socially divisive legislation than even North Carolina. ” “This isn’t scare tactics  —   this is actually happening,” Mr. McAuliffe said. “If you had a Republican governor, he would have had to sign them, and think where we would be today. ” In Iowa, a Democratic state senator, Janet Petersen, said the zeal of the new Republican majority had broken a mood of passivity among    Democrats. On the Planned Parenthood issue alone, Ms. Petersen said her office had received about 1, 500 emails from alarmed constituents. “If there’s one positive thing to come out of this horrible legislation,” she said, “it’s that complacency is gone. ”	1
441	ALBI, France  —   The paint is fading, but the word is still clear: Alimentation, “Groceries. ” It seems like a stage prop, grafted above the window of the empty old storefront. Opposite stands a tattoo parlor. Nobody enters or leaves. The street is deserted. Keep walking, and you’ll find more vacant storefronts, scattered around the old center of this town dominated by its imposing   brick cathedral, one of France’s undisputed treasures. Tourist shops and chain clothing stores are open, but missing are the groceries, cafes and butcher shops that once bustled with life and for centuries defined   France. Measuring change, and decay, is not easy in France, where beauty is just around the corner and life can seem unchanged over decades. But the decline evident in Albi is replicated in hundreds of other places. France is losing the core of its historic provincial towns  —   dense hubs of urbanity deep in the countryside where judges judged, Balzac set his novels, prefects issued edicts and citizens shopped for 50 cheeses. In January, I went to Albi while covering the French presidential election. I’ve known the city for nearly 35 years, visiting a handful of times as part of a lifetime’s engagement with France that began at age 4 when my family moved to Paris. My first trip to Albi came in 1982, with my college girlfriend, and I found a bustling,   city that took its   color from bricks that had been used since the Middle Ages and echoed the hot, meridional sun. I was captivated. I returned in January not on the trail of a presidential candidate but to better understand a French paradox just beneath the surface of the campaign: the deep pride felt by the French in what they regard as an unparalleled way of life, always accompanied by anxiety that it is facing extinction. The campaign is like few before it in France, because of the looming question of whether the   candidate, Marine Le Pen, will do the   and win. She has already pushed the discourse rightward and made a visceral promise to voters: to protect not just France, but Frenchness. Whether the menace is defined as Islam, immigration or globalization, her vow to voters is the same: I am the woman to preserve the French way of life. The visible decline of so many historic city centers is intertwined with these anxieties. Losing the ancient French provincial capital is another blow to Frenchness  —   tangible evidence of a disappearing way of life that resonates in France in the same way that the hollowing out of main streets did in the United States decades ago. A survey of French towns found that commercial vacancies have almost doubled to 10. 4 percent in the past 15 years. As these towns have declined, voters have often turned sharply rightward. Albi is traditionally centrist, but the same conditions of decline and political anxiety are present, too. Turn a corner in Albi, and you’ll pass the last school inside the historic center, abandoned a few years ago. Down another street is the last toy store, now closed, and around a corner is the last independent grocery store, also shuttered. Walk down the empty, narrow streets on some nights and the silence is so complete that you can hear your footsteps on the stones. “If nothing is done, a substantial part of the French soul will perish, taking with it more than half the French population,” the businessman Charles Beigbeder wrote in Le Figaro recently, calling for a “Marshall Plan” for “peripheral France. ” I arrived in Albi, population 49, 000, on a Thursday evening, having driven in from Toulouse, an hour away. At the edge of town, I passed a giant shopping center, Les Portes d’Albi, where the parking lot was black with cars. In the Albi I had known before, people had lived in town above their stores. Centuries of accumulated living were packed inside the   boulevards. Shopping was as much about sociability as about buying. Before arriving, I picked up a government report, an autopsy of many French provincial capitals: Agen, Limoges, Bourges, Arras, Beziers, Auxerre, Vichy, Calais and others. In these old towns, many harder hit than Albi, the interplay of the   architecture, weathered stone and brick, and public life had been one of the crucibles of French history and culture for centuries. Now they were endangered, as even the dry language of the report conveyed that an essential part of French life is disappearing. “This phenomenon of the devitalization of the urban centers is worrisome,” the government report declared, “as the stores contribute so much to city life and largely fashion it. ” My first appointment was with the town   who had agreed to give me a tour. Florian Jourdain wasn’t exposing local corruption but the decline of the town that was hidden in plain sight. His meticulous blog, picked up by the French press, caused such resentment among Albi’s commercial establishment that last year the merchants’ association staged a demonstration against him in the main square. With a degree in history and studies in geography, Mr. Jourdain published an online map, with a    marking each vacant store. He discovered that nearly 40 percent of the remaining shops sold clothes, and he suspected that much of the trade was with tourists. Only a single traditional boulangerie, or bakery, remained in Albi’s old core, and not a single   butcher shop. A Parisian by origin, Mr. Jourdain worked   and few in town, even among his allies, seemed to know his last name. I met him on a Friday morning in the windswept plaza of the looming Cathédrale   a giant brick fortress built eight centuries ago to awe the region’s restive heretics. As we started on the Rue Mariès, the city’s main commercial street, Mr. Jourdain pulled his hood down over his head to avoid being recognized, as I struggled to mentally repopulate the empty street with the liveliness that had delighted me 35 years before. “For me, if you are precise, you can’t be attacked,” he said of his work. “It’s a big problem for me that there are no grocery stores in the center of the city. There is no neighborhood cafe. ” Street after street, we took the measure of the town’s fragility. Name tags were missing from buzzers at the doorways of the old buildings. Above them the shutters stayed closed night and day, with estimates that 15 percent of these old houses are vacant. Mr. Jourdain knew something was amiss soon after arriving from Paris in 2013. “Right away I realized it,” he said. “Just across from us, and right next to us, there were two magnificent buildings, vacant. I thought it was strange. And then I started to see more and more empty stores. ” We came to the Place Lapérouse, named after the great French explorer who was born in Albi in the 18th century. I had a flashback. On a warm afternoon many years before, I sat on a bench here, gazing at the old buildings around me. It had been quiet enough to hear the birds in the centenarian plane trees shading the square. Now, it was a frigid intersection combined with a soulless pedestrian plaza. Cars whizzed past. We moved on, passing two storefronts with “total liquidation” written across them. The sense I had many years before, of a dense urban space that was a living, breathing organism, was gone. “Look, here, this used to be a cafe,” he said, pointing to a woman’s clothing store where the faint remains of a traditional cafe awning were still visible. Mr. Jourdain spoke with the fervor of a disappointed suitor. He had moved to Albi to embrace its beauty and to escape the clamor of Paris but instead found a creeping listlessness. He saw his role as waking up his fellow citizens. “The risk is great for our beautiful episcopal city,” he wrote in his blog. We moved on to the empty Rue de la Croix Blanche. Again, we were the only walkers, passing a line of closed stores. On the Rue Puech Bérenguier we passed the last grocery store. On the Rue Peyrolière we saw the abandoned elementary school, closed in 2013, a classic Third Republic building where generations of Albigeois were educated. On the wall inside, a children’s drawing from the last class was still visible. “The cries of children will resound no longer,” the local paper, La Dépêche du Midi, wrote when the school closed. In former days, the covered market, the Marché Couvert, would have been a hub of life and commerce. No more. “You feel as though time has been suspended,” Mr. Jourdain said. Hours had passed on a sunny Friday in the center of town, yet on some streets we saw almost no one. “You see clearly that we are on a street that is dying,” Mr. Jourdain said on Rue Emile Grand as we concluded our tour. “There are whole buildings where there isn’t a soul. ” I called City Hall for a meeting with the mayor, a member of France’s   party, but was met with a distinct lack of enthusiasm from her spokeswoman. I was put off with the promise of a phone call the following week, and when I finally reached the mayor, Stéphanie   she argued that urban “devitalization” has had a “relatively moderate impact. ” She also angrily condemned Mr. Jourdain. “He is an extraterrestrial,” she said, “who came here to get talked about. ” The head of the merchants’ association, who had led the demonstration against Mr. Jourdain, was equally elusive. He was not to be found at the anonymous basement supermarket he runs beneath the Marché Couvert. Nobody knew when he would show up or how to reach him, and the association’s office in the center of town had long since closed. The next morning was a Saturday, the busiest shopping day of the week, with shops promising sales and customers inside the clothing stores. There was a hint of the liveliness I had remembered from many years before, but these were weekend shoppers, many from out of town. I went to see Fabien Lacoste, a Socialist city councilman, in the shadow of the cathedral. As on most Saturdays, he was at work, flipping crepes at his outdoor food stand. To him, Albi’s fate was a cultural misfortune. City leaders had poured money into a   modernistic new culture center at the town’s edge. And the shopping mall had been built. Large grocery chains, called hypermarkets, had also been constructed outside the city, with free parking. It is not that Albi no longer had commerce, or activity. But the essence of the ancient city was being lost. The rise of the shopping centers traced the sharp rise in living standards brought on by what the French call the Trente Glorieuses, the 30 glorious years from 1945 to 1975. Growth was around 4 percent purchasing power of the average worker’s salary rose 170 percent. The boost to consumer demand could not be met by the old   structure of small shops, small purchases. Malls and strip centers were born. Today, France has the highest density of such retail space in all of Europe, even as vacancies in 190 historic town centers have gone to 10. 4 percent in 2015 from 6. 1 percent in 2001, according to the government report. Thus, the French paradox: a newly consumerist society that had stripped France of its “soul”  —   made even worse, now, by the fact that economic growth has collapsed. “There’s no bar, no cafe. We’re in the southwest, for heaven’s sake. It’s a scandal,” said Mr. Lacoste, serving up crepes to his customers. “We’ve lost that conviviality that was our signature. Before, each little neighborhood had its own center, with its own cafe. All that has disappeared. ” “What I deplore is this devitalization,” Mr. Lacoste added. “You won’t be doing your shopping here. ” By Sunday, Albi had reverted to its weekday torpor. I went for my evening run along the green Tarn river and passed a   people at most. In the twilight the town felt abandoned. I finally caught up with the head of the merchants’ association just as he was leaving his supermarket. He did not seem pleased to see me and was even less pleased with Mr. Jourdain. “There are town centers where the situation is much more complicated,” he said. My last interview before leaving town was with Eric Lamarre. Last year, he closed Albi’s last toy store. “Twenty years ago, the center of town was still animated,” he said. “People really came to town to buy. There were loads of lovely things. It buzzed with people. ” The big shopping center opened in 2009, and his business declined until the end, when he was losing 50, 000 euros (about $53, 000) a year. “It’s a political problem,” he said. “These towns have been had. They always say yes to the shopping center developers. ” Albi, he said, “is still a magnificent city  —   for the tourists. ”	1
273	At the steering wheel my father consults his large paper map, turning it this way and that, squinting at the small blue lines that squiggle through tiny Maine coastal towns. He’s heard that the author E. B. White’s house is somewhere around here, and he’s determined to find it. My mother, next to him in the passenger seat of our rusty gold station wagon with my baby sister on her lap, raises her eyebrows at my other two sisters and me,   in the second row. It’s the early 70s, and seatbelts haven’t caught on yet. We gaze back at her, knowing that once Dad gets an idea into his head, it’s almost impossible to stop him. We range in age from 1 to 10 (I’m the oldest) and all of us are literally and figuratively along for the ride. Besides, we’re excited at the prospect of meeting this author we already feel we know. We’ve been lulled to sleep every night by the soft cadence of my dad’s Southern accent as he reads us stories about a wise spider and a hapless pig, a resourceful mouse and a mute swan. Dad pulls off the road into the dusty parking lot of a country store with a lone gas pump, and gets out of the car. We hear him chatting with the attendant through the open window. “Sure is nice around here. ” The guy shrugs. My sisters and I glance at each other. Rural Mainers tend to be   and   averse. But as usual, Dad doesn’t seem to notice. “You lived here long?” “Ayuh. ” Amazingly, before long, and with only a little coaxing, the attendant is telling Dad about his grandkids and his lobster boat and pointing off into the distance, giving him the intel he’s come for. “Mr. White lives right over that hill there. Privet hedge in front. Can’t miss it. ” Back on the road, my sister Cynthia ventures, “Isn’t it rude to show up on someone’s doorstep without asking?” Dad grins and winks at us in the rearview mirror. “He’ll be flattered. ” We pull up to the farmhouse to find a courtly   man trimming the hedge with a set of clippers. “It’s him!” Dad whispers. He rolls down his window and leans out. “Hello, good sir!” The man seems a little nonplused. “I have a car full of young readers here who’d give anything to meet their favorite author. A word from you, and they’ll remember this moment for the rest of their lives. ” What choice does the poor man have? Within a few minutes, the famously reclusive E. B. White is demonstrating to a cluster of little girls in bathing suits that when you crush pine needles between your fingers and hold it to your nose, the smell is as strong as patchouli. And Dad is right  —   we never will forget it. My childhood was rife with moments like this. Dad was always going out on a limb, befriending people who didn’t necessarily seem to want new friends, trespassing on private property, pushing the boundaries of acceptable behavior in quest of adventure. His philosophy was that you don’t need money or plans, only a willingness to be present in the moment and to go where inspiration takes you. If you don’t, you’ll miss the entire point of being alive. Raised dirt poor in rural Georgia by a millworker mother and a father who often went to the bar rather than home after work, Dad learned early on that his quickest route up the social ladder was through charm and smarts. He got himself to college  —   the first in his family  —   on a football scholarship, then used seminary to springboard to a doctorate in a foreign land. As a young academic in the ‘60s, he grew to reject traditional values and had scant respect for the social codes of privilege. At parties, he could often be found talking to the bartender or a    Irish grandmother in the kitchen rather than the hosts. A Southerner through and through, even after moving to Maine, he was constitutionally incapable of walking down a street in New York without stopping to chat with doormen, bodega owners and homeless people. He never met a taxi driver whose story he didn’t want to know. Dad’s unorthodox and sometimes embarrassing friendliness got him, and us, into trouble now and then. Some people didn’t take kindly to probing questions. Others found his   openness suspect or unsophisticated. But his innate, bottomless curiosity about the world also taught his four daughters to be open to new experiences and comfortable with improvisation. Even now, in his late 70s, he lives each day with a kind of purposeful recklessness, asking provocative questions and seeking new experiences in the belief that he can break through to something better, more meaningful, more satisfying. Though my parents had little money, they took us on adventures all over the world. Driving through Scotland in a rainstorm, we pulled over to the side of the road and rode the wild ponies grazing by the fence. We coaxed a stray lamb over to our rented R. V. to feed it. One year my father switched houses, cars, teaching jobs, committees and pets with a professor in Melbourne, Australia, sight unseen. Another year our family of six flew to Crete without a plan at the airport Dad bought a map and started asking random strangers, with the help of a woefully inadequate Greek phrase book: “What should we do?” “Where should we stay?” This spontaneity meant that we missed flights, lost luggage, drove on perilous roads late at night, stayed in some   hovels, and sometimes went hungry. But it also yielded beautiful surprises: an undiscovered beach, a fisherman’s hut with a breathtaking view, a hillside breakfast of goats’ milk yogurt and fresh honey that I still remember 35 years later. It led to his daughters’ sense of the world not as a huge frightening place but as a wonderland ripe for discovery. The Maine farmhouse in Andrew Wyeth’s iconic painting “Christina’s World” was not yet a museum or even open to the public when my father got it into his head  —   soon after our ambush of E. B. White  —   to take a family field trip there. Following his usual routine, he pulled into the small village of Cushing and asked a local how to find the Olson house. When we arrived (no doubt trespassing) we picnicked in the field where the woman in the pink dress in the painting had lain. Looking up at that weathered gray house on the hill, and hearing the story of the woman with my name who spent her lifetime there, I was entranced. Years later, I drew on that experience to tell my own story of the painting in my new book. There’s no doubt that my dad’s endless curiosity has shaped who I am. I often find myself  —   to my own kids’ embarrassment  —   chatting with strangers in lines, accepting spontaneous invitations, and seeking     adventures. I think the most important thing I learned from my dad is that when you go out on a limb there’s a risk it will break, but you’ll get a whole new perspective on the world. And if you’re really lucky, it can feel like flying.	1

413	SEOUL, South Korea  —   Officials from North Korea’s secret police and Foreign Ministry were involved in the killing of the estranged half brother of the country’s leader, South Korean intelligence officials told lawmakers on Monday. Ever since Kim   the eldest brother of the North Korean leader, Kim   was first reported assassinated, the South Korean government has held the North responsible. On Monday, the National Intelligence Service in Seoul provided more details of what it described as   terrorism, saying that four of the eight North Koreans identified as suspects by the Malaysian authorities were agents from North Korea’s Ministry of State Security, the country’s secret police. Speaking on Monday in a   parliamentary hearing, Lee   the director of the National Intelligence Service, said that two other suspects worked for the North Korean Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The remaining two were affiliated with Air Koryo, the North’s   airline company, and Singwang Economics and Trading General Corporation, Mr. Lee said, according to two lawmakers who attended the briefing. Singwang is among North Korean companies facing United Nations sanctions. The Malaysian authorities have said that Mr. Kim was killed by an extremely toxic nerve agent known as VX. They said that the North Koreans had hired and trained two women, one from Indonesia, the other from Vietnam, to attack Mr. Kim at Kuala Lumpur International Airport. The women smeared his face with the chemical while he was waiting to check in for a flight to Macau, where he and his family had a home, they said. The two women are now in police custody in Kuala Lumpur. Mr. Lee, the South Korean intelligence chief, was quoted by the lawmakers as saying that the eight North Koreans, working as two   teams, converged in Kuala Lumpur to carry out the Feb. 13 assassination. He said that Ri   a state security agent, and Ri   a Foreign Ministry official, had brought Doan Thi Huong, a    Vietnamese woman, into the assassination plot, while Siti Aisyah, a    Indonesian woman, was hired by O   a state security agent, and by Hong   a Foreign Ministry official. The four North Koreans who made up the assassination team left Malaysia the same day Mr. Kim was killed and are believed to be back in their country, Mr. Lee was quoted as saying. The Malaysian police have confirmed their departure. Hyon   a senior diplomat at the North Korean Embassy in Kuala Lumpur, and three other North Koreans worked as a support team, Mr. Lee told the lawmakers, keeping track of Kim  ’s whereabouts and providing logistical assistance. Mr. Hyon worked for the Ministry of State Security, he said. Mr. Hyon and the Air Koryo employee, Kim   remain at the embassy in Malaysia. A third member of the support team, identified as Ri   has been arrested in Kuala Lumpur. The fourth, identified as Ri   is believed to be at large in Malaysia. North Korea’s Ministry of State Security specializes in ferreting out people whose loyalty to Kim  ’s totalitarian regime is in doubt. Mr. Kim is believed to have used the ministry in the arrests and executions of senior officials, including an uncle, Jang   who was executed on charges of corruption and sedition in 2013. The ministry also runs a network of prison camps. During the intelligence briefing on Monday, Mr. Lee told the lawmakers that five senior officials affiliated with the State Security Ministry had been executed with antiaircraft guns. He also said that Gen. Kim   who was removed as chief of the secret police in January, was in detention as part of a purge. Mr. Lee said that General Kim and his five deputies had angered Kim   by filing false reports, but he did not elaborate. The South’s intelligence agency had said earlier that General Kim was dismissed on charges of corruption and abuse of power. He was the latest in a series of   party and military officials that Kim   has fired, demoted or executed in efforts to consolidate his power through what South Korean officials have called a “reign of terror. ”	1
653	 Donald Trump has broken all kinds of norms during his presidential campaign, but he just went to a whole new level this morning by tweeting what is supposedly an image of his private-parts. The tweet was quickly deleted but not before being retweeted over 5,000 times.The tweet comes in response to comments made by Marco Rubio about the size of Donald Trump’s hands during the Republican debate last night.	0
70	Meryl Streep, in a fiery speech criticizing President Trump on Saturday night, pledged to stand up against “brownshirts and bots” at a time when she and others are increasingly denouncing his administration’s policies and the president himself. Ms. Streep, in New York City accepting an award from the Human Rights Campaign, referred to the backlash she received after the Golden Globes in January, when she gave a speech denouncing Mr. Trump. “It’s terrifying to put the target on your forehead, and it sets you up for all sorts of attacks and armies of brownshirts and bots and worse, and the only way you can do it is to feel you have to,” Ms. Streep said. “You have to. You don’t have an option. You have to. ” It was not immediately clear to whom Ms. Streep was referring in using the loaded term “brownshirts,” which was originally applied to a paramilitary group that assisted the rise of Adolf Hitler and Nazi Germany. The speech was an even more stinging rebuke of Mr. Trump than her Golden Globes speech. She seemed to relish a new type of role: Trump provocateur. Although this time, Ms. Streep was without a national television audience. She took a moment to respond directly to Mr. Trump, who called her “overrated” in the midst of a barrage of posts on Twitter the morning after the Golden Globes. “I am the most overrated, overdecorated and, currently, overberated actress, who likes football, of my generation,” Ms. Streep said. The crowd applauded wildly. Ms. Streep was receiving the National Ally for Equality Award from the Human Rights Campaign, an advocacy group for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender issues. Near the beginning of her acceptance speech, she addressed, initially in a lighthearted way, one of the most controversial parts of her Golden Globes speech. “I do like football,” Ms. Streep said, to a roar of laughter from the crowd at the Waldorf Astoria. At the Golden Globes, Ms. Streep said, “Hollywood is crawling with outsiders and foreigners. If you kick them all out, you’ll have nothing to watch but football and mixed martial arts, which are not the arts. ” She received a torrent of criticism, particularly from conservatives, for disparaging the two sports, something she acknowledged in her speech and attempted to clarify what she meant. “It isn’t helpful to make it us versus them,” Ms. Streep said. Referring to the film producer and director Mike Nichols, she continued, “I was making a joke, and Mike Nichols told me, ‘If you have to explain the joke, Meryl, you’re doomed. ’” Later in the speech, she returned to criticizing Mr. Trump. “If his catastrophic instinct to retaliate doesn’t lead us to nuclear winter, we will have much to thank this president for,” Ms. Streep said. “Because he will have woken us up to how fragile freedom really is. ” At one point, Ms. Streep referred to Mr. Trump as a “” and said, “The whip of the executive can through a Twitter feed lash and intimidate, punish and humiliate, delegitimize the press and imagined enemies with spasmodic irregularity and easily provoked predictability. ”	1
439	SEOUL, South Korea  —   The head of Samsung, one of the world’s largest conglomerates, was indicted on bribery and embezzlement charges on Tuesday, becoming one of the most prominent business tycoons ever to face trial in South Korea. The indictment of Lee   the company’s de facto leader, came at the end of a special prosecutor’s   investigation of a corruption scandal that has already led to the impeachment of President Park  . When huge crowds took to the streets in recent months to demand that she leave office, they also called for the toppling of Mr. Lee and other corporate titans. Mr. Lee was arrested on Feb. 17, a dramatic development in South Korea’s struggle to end collusive ties between the government and the   conglomerates, or chaebol, that dominate the economy. Four other senior executives of Samsung were also indicted Tuesday, but not arrested, on the same corruption charges as Mr. Lee, and three of the four resigned. Those indictments had been expected and were not seen as indications of a threat to the Lee family’s control of the business. South Koreans have grown weary of endemic corruption and the country’s traditional leniency toward tycoons accused of   crimes. For decades, presidents have entered office vowing to end such favoritism, but they all eventually backtracked. Anticorruption advocates say Mr. Lee’s indictment and trial will be a test of whether the system can finally make a dent in those cozy relationships. Samsung, by far the largest of the chaebol, has long been a symbol of power and wealth in a nation that has transformed itself from an agrarian economy to one of the world’s technological powerhouses. Samsung’s market capitalization accounts for   of the value of all listed companies in South Korea, and its main unit, Samsung Electronics, alone ships 20 percent of the country’s total exports. Mr. Lee was accused of giving or promising $38 million in bribes to Choi   a secretive confidante of Ms. Park. In return, the prosecutor said in his indictment, Mr. Lee received political favors, most notably government support for a merger of two Samsung affiliates in 2015 that helped him inherit corporate control from his incapacitated father, Lee  . Mr. Lee was also accused of committing perjury when he insisted during a parliamentary hearing that he had never bribed Ms. Choi or Ms. Park. He still claims that the “donations” Samsung paid out to Ms. Choi were coerced, suggesting that the company was extorted. Samsung has said it will try to clear Mr. Lee’s name at trial. It did not immediately comment on his indictment on Tuesday. In the South Korean system, once a suspect is formally arrested, indictment automatically follows, unless evidence emerges that proves the person’s innocence. Those cases are extremely rare. Mr. Lee, 48, a vice chairman of Samsung, has been running the company since his father had a heart attack in 2014. His indictment comes after a challenging period for the company, which issued a global recall of its Galaxy Note 7 smartphones, the most ambitious product launched under his leadership, because they were prone to catching fire. The elder Mr. Lee was convicted of bribery and tax evasion twice but never spent a day in jail. Each time, he was pardoned by the president and returned to the company. At least six of the nation’s top 10 chaebol  —   which generate revenue equivalent to more than 80 percent of gross domestic product  —   are led by men once convicted of   crimes. Ms. Park was identified as a criminal accomplice in November, when state prosecutors indicted Ms. Choi on charges of extorting tens of millions of dollars from Samsung and other chaebol by leveraging her connections with the president. But she was protected from indictment while in office. On Tuesday, the special prosecutor, Park   added a bribery charge to the case against Ms. Choi, who is already on trial. He said Ms. Park could also face bribery and extortion charges once she leaves office. Ms. Park denies any wrongdoing, saying the money from Samsung was part of “donations” that businesses provided to two foundations that prosecutors said were controlled by Ms. Choi. Ms. Park’s presidential powers have been suspended since the National Assembly impeached her in December. The Constitutional Court is expected to rule in the coming weeks on whether Ms. Park should be formally ousted or reinstated and allowed to finish her   term, which ends next February. In the current scandal, Samsung was accused of making payments to Ms. Choi in exchange for a crucial vote by the   National Pension Service to support the 2015 merger of two Samsung affiliates. The special prosecutor says Ms. Park ordered the pension fund to support the merger on Mr. Lee’s behalf. The merger caused a loss of at least $123 million for the national pension fund, which held large stakes in the two affiliates, but it increased the stock value of the Lee family by at least $758 million, the prosecutor said. The four executives under Mr. Lee who were also indicted belonged to Samsung Electronics or to the conglomerate’s powerful, secretive Corporate Strategy Office. Critics say the office worked mainly to tighten the Lee family’s imperial control of the conglomerate and enforce the    transfer of leadership. On Tuesday, Samsung said it was disbanding the office as part of its effort to make its corporate governance more transparent.	1
57	Mike Ilitch, a   son of immigrants who founded Little Caesars Pizza in a Detroit suburb and also owned baseball’s Tigers and hockey’s Red Wings, building a business, sports and entertainment empire that made him among America’s wealthiest men and helped change the face of his native city, died on Friday in Detroit. He was 87. His death was announced by his company, Ilitch Holdings. Mr. Ilitch and his wife, Marian, had a net worth of $6. 1 billion at his death, according to Forbes. Mr. Ilitch never went to college and failed in his bid to make it from the Tigers’ minor league chain, where he played shortstop, to the major leagues. He found his calling in the business world when he and his wife opened the first Little Caesars, in Garden City, a Detroit suburb, in 1959. It became the world’s largest carryout pizza chain, known for TV ads announcing “Pizza! Pizza!”    deals. Turning to the sports world, Mr. Ilitch spent freely and eventually turned around franchises that experienced many lean years. His Tigers won two American League pennants, and his Red Wings of the National Hockey League won four Stanley Cup championships. He bought the Fox Theater in downtown Detroit in the late 1980s, refurbished it and created an entertainment hub for the city. He moved his corporate headquarters from suburban Farmington Hills into the   building that contains the Fox. Mr. Ilitch broke into sports ownership in 1982, when he paid a reported $8 million to purchase the Red Wings from the Norris family. Once a powerhouse with names like Gordie Howe, Ted Lindsay and Terry Sawchuk, the franchise was struggling. In August 1985, Mr. Ilitch, commenting on why his Red Wings were aggressive in pursuing free agents, said: “I hate to lose. I happen to be a fan with an owner’s pocketbook. ” His Wings won the Stanley Cup championship in 1997, 1998, 2002 and 2008, and he was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 2003 and into the U. S. Hockey Hall of Fame a year later. Mr. Ilitch, who became known as Mr. I, bought the Tigers from the Domino’s pizza founder Tom Monaghan for $85 million in 1992. Starting in 1994, the Tigers had 12 consecutive losing seasons, but in 2000 they moved from the aging Tiger Stadium to Comerica Park. They won the 2006 American League pennant, then lost to the St. Louis Cardinals in the World Series. They were in the World Series again in 2012, featuring the sluggers Miguel Cabrera and Prince Fielder and pitchers Justin Verlander and Max Scherzer, but were swept by the San Francisco Giants. “I’m not afraid to go out and spend money,” Mr. Ilitch said. “It’s been very costly, but I’m not going to change my ways. ” Mike Ilitch was born on July 20, 1929, a son of Sotir Ilitch, a machinist, and Sultana Tasseff Ilitch, who had come to the United States from Macedonia in 1924. He was an   athlete in baseball and track at Cooley High School, served four years in the Marines, then signed with the Tigers’ minor league system, but his   career ended after a few seasons when he sustained a knee injury. He worked as a    salesman until he and his wife opened the first Little Caesars on May 8, 1959. A food service distribution company soon followed to supply ingredients and other products for restaurants. Blue Line Foodservice grew into one of the largest food service distribution companies in the country. Mr. Ilitch’s charitable endeavors included the Little Caesars Love Kitchen, a restaurant on wheels to feed the hungry and help with food distribution following national disasters. The Ilitch organization has embarked on a $1. 2 billion District Detroit project, transforming dozens of largely vacant blocks in downtown Detroit into a neighborhood including office and residential spaces. All of Mr. Ilitch’s businesses have their headquarters in the Detroit metropolitan area. His son Christopher is president and chief executive officer of Ilitch Holdings. In addition to his wife and his son Christopher, Mr. Ilitch is survived by his sons Michael Jr. Atanas and Ron his daughters, Denise, Lisa and Carole 22 grandchildren and three  . “Mike Ilitch was more than just a shrewd, successful businessman,” Detroit’s mayor, Mike Duggan, said in a statement. “He was a Detroiter through and through. Whether he was making pizza, building successful sports and entertainment franchises or supporting youth organizations in our city, Mr. I helped to bring thousands of jobs and opportunities to our city and attract millions of dollars of investment. ”	1
474	Around this time last year, when Kanye West was griping about the Grammys, he took to Twitter and asked, incredulously, “Has anyone at the Grammys ever heard March Madness? ??” That would be one of several hits by Future, who in a spectacular run beginning in late 2014 and lasting through the end of 2015, released a cluster of outstanding mixtapes and albums that somehow landed out of the reach of mainstream awareness, even as they set the agenda, again and again, within  . That Future wouldn’t be lauded by the Grammys  —   the same thing happened this year, for what it’s worth  —   reflects his precarious relationship to the old   establishment (loosely welcome, but held at arm’s length) as well as the way the new   establishment has little need for the old rule makers, either within the genre or outside. Whether he’s accepted or not, Future persists. He’s perhaps the only rapper working who has successfully mimicked the samizdat, sub rosa feel of the mixtape era and parlayed it into a sustainable   career. He is both ubiquitous and obscure, a cipher who pops up in the most unexpected places. He is always on the horizon, and always in the shadows. Accordingly, he’s put out a pair of new albums in quick succession: “Future,” which was released two weeks ago and topped the Billboard album chart, and “Hndrxx,” which followed last week and is expected to topple its predecessor. (If that happens, he will become the first artist in Billboard history to pull off that feat.) This rainstorm of music is purposeful  —   as much as any aesthetic choice, excess is Future’s art. Most artists try their best to skip from peak to peak, knowing that the valleys in between can be deep and unforgiving. But Future’s consistency has tremendous value  —   he’s as much high plateau as peak, and better off for it. As has become clear over the past three years, Future is telling one long, wide, deep story, rather than dozens of discrete ones. His boasts are built with creatine, his voice soaked in acid. He’s a cryptic storyteller, in so much as his stories have beginnings, middles or ends. Typically, he strings together a few fragments with wild impact, covering the same thin topical range. A good example is the intro of “Hallucinating”: “I seduce you with this Aston Martin I bought   you done did more drugs than me? You must be hallucinating. ” He’s not preoccupied with crafting songs  —   though when he relaxes, he makes some of the most thrilling ones. Rather, he is submerged in a lifestyle, and his lyrics are quick, impressionistic smears. Taken in sum, his music verges on ambient, a   sound without edges or direction. In this way, Future is surprisingly   to the album format  —   he’s best consumed in wide gulps. Others use albums to shape coherent narratives for Future, they’re meant as floods. Total absorption is the thing. Most striking is how “Future” and “Hndrxx” tell two different stories while feeling like part of the same formless narrative. “Future” is closer to his earlier work, with barked brags (the excellent “Super Trapper”) and ruminative   that veers toward the psychedelic (“I don’t ever walk on   float off Earth, always float off Earth”). Antagonism is here, too: There’s a song called “POA,” as in power of attorney, as in what kind of life must you be living that legal terminology is so close to the fore of your creativity? The final two songs on “Future”  —   “When I Was Broke” and “Feds Did a Sweep”  —   strike a tone of deep melancholy that’s picked up on “Hndrxx” and used as a foundation. “Hndrxx” is almost wholly devoted to affairs of the heart  —   how his is fragile, and how he treats others’ carelessly. Several songs are strikingly personal, seemingly inspired by his publicly troubled relationship with the RB singer Ciara, with whom he has a son. “I told you from the start you was gonna turn on me,” he sings at the beginning of “Turn on Me,” then castigates himself for the relationship’s mistakes and its fallout: On both albums, the reference points are the same  —   glistening, wet diamonds Range Rovers purchased with pocket money women from all parts of the globe getting celebrated and mistreated, often in the same breath. Because these albums are best taken in their totality, it doesn’t quite matter if there are duds sprinkled throughout, and of course there are. Instead, it’s more revealing to focus on the technical rules Future revises, or ignores: He long ago melted the line between singing and rapping, but sometimes, he changes the rhyming syllable   as if he’s forgotten, or doesn’t care he raps in abstracted fragments and yet manages to sing a heartfelt duet with Rihanna (“Selfish”). The ocean is far more important than any one wave. On both albums, the rapping is more literal and direct than it has been in recent years  —   the enunciation is stronger (and therefore less intriguing) and often he’s emphasizing the final syllable in each line as a way of planting a flag. That directness hasn’t always been central to his work, but it’s reflective of the slightly more exalted position he holds in pop right now, a level of success where he’s guesting on Ariana Grande and Maroon 5 songs (which come as slightly less of a shock than when he teamed up with the early adopter Miley Cyrus a few years ago). One of the upsides of releasing so much music is that it’s easier to hide an occasional bizarre misstep. But even if Future continues to flirt with pop attention, it’s unlikely to be his dominant narrative. He’s more a state of mind than a set of songs. “Future” and “Hndrxx,” though very good, aren’t his best work, but they’re part of a story that’s still unfolding. Whether anyone’s listening or not, the Future story has no end.	1
479	(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the  .) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. Attorney General Jeff Sessions recused himself from any investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election, but denied that his newly revealed contacts with a Russian official were related to the presidential campaign. Democratic leaders called on Mr. Sessions to resign. Republicans confronted a widening split in their ranks over how to proceed amid a growing uproar over questions about the Trump team’s ties to Russia, even as they mostly resisted calls for a special prosecutor or select committee. The White House disclosed that Michael Flynn, the national security adviser, and Jared Kushner, the president’s    and senior adviser, also met with the Russian ambassador in December. As we reported, the outgoing Obama administration scrambled to preserve intelligence about the campaign’s possible contacts with Russia by spreading it across the government. _____ 2. On Capitol Hill, Ben Carson, the    was confirmed as secretary of housing and urban development. And Rick Perry, the former Texas governor, got final approval to lead the Energy Department, a role that puts him in charge of the country’s nuclear arsenal. Another administration official, the new secretary of the interior, Ryan Zinke of Montana, arrived at his new office on horseback. _____ 3. Republican lawmakers in at least 16 states are trying to rein in protests with bills to make them more orderly or to toughen penalties when they go awry. Some of the bills are backed by the president’s supporters, and some appear to be responses to demonstrations against him and his policies. One activist called the proposals “intimidation from the right. ” _____ 4. Shares of Snap Inc. valued at $24 billion in its public offering, jumped 41 percent in the company’s first day of trading. That’s a powerful showing for Snap’s   messaging service, Snapchat. Wall Street has been on an upward trajectory since Election Day. Our columnist looks at what the booming markets mean for the global economy. _____ 5. Syrian government forces again drove Islamic State militants out of Palmyra, the ancient city that was prewar Syria’s leading tourist attraction. The Islamic State had used the city as a propaganda windfall, making a sport out of pilfering and vandalizing prized antiquities it considered heretical, and using the Roman theater for public beheadings. _____ 6. A year after the European Union closed its borders to asylum seekers, tens of thousands of refugees languish in camps in Greece, many of them children. Their lives in limbo have taken on an air of permanence. “Everyone here feels depressed,” said a young Afghan. _____ 7. China has at least 10 White Houses, four Arcs de Triomphe, a couple of Great Sphinxes and at least one Eiffel Tower. But a replica of London’s Tower Bridge, celebrated as “even more magnificent” than the original, has set off a debate over whether these buildings  —   created as publicity stunts and popular as photo backdrops  —   are actually denigrating Chinese culture. _____ 8. A few prominent artists are working to preserve the   house where Nina Simone was born, in the Blue Ridge Mountains of North Carolina. A previous owner had invested in period 1930s details, hoping to make it into a museum for the legendary singer and civil rights icon, who died in 2003 at age 70. But the project languished. “She formed a lot of who I am and my sense of history,” said one of the artists. “And I think of the town as a portal to a woman who influenced so many. ” _____ 9. New Orleans may be known for Mardi Gras, but Mobile, Ala. dates its Carnival celebration to 1703, making it the oldest in the U. S. More than 70   mystic societies celebrated this year, most of which remain segregated by race and class. Join us inside the   festivities. _____ 10. Finally, the iconic cherry blossom trees that ring the Tidal Basin of the National Mall have heralded the coming of spring for nearly a century. This year, they are one more sign of climate change. The National Park Service says the blossoms could burst and reach their peak as soon as March 14, a full three weeks earlier than normal and the earliest date on record. The jump has set off a scramble to adjust a festival schedule expected to involve up to 1. 5 million people. _____ Photographs may appear out of order for some readers.

14	In a nondescript office building on West 39th Street, behind    doors and a stack of nondisclosure agreements, Raf Simons is at work, rebuilding the house of Calvin Klein. Calvin Klein’s is a name so famous as to have earned pride of place on underwear bands the world over. Maybe yours. Mr. Klein was, in the words of The New York Times, a “pop star” and “the first American designer to become   famous. ” That name is synonymous with American fashion design in the 20th century, part of a small,   pantheon that includes Ralph (Lauren) Donna (Karan) and Oscar (de la Renta). His forte was sportswear: easy, effortless clothes, later expanded to include blockbuster underwear and jeans. But you knew that. It was more than 30 years ago when a young Brooke Shields cooed that nothing comes between her and her Calvins. She did not need to specify which Calvin. Mr. Simons, though by no means unknown, is not Calvin. His name, Raf (rhymes with “laugh,” with a rolled Flemish R) is invoked with adoration in   circles. But even after a successful stint as the artistic director of Christian Dior, he has arrived in New York with less name recognition among the public. His task is to bring energy and excitement back to Calvin Klein  —   and back, by extension, to New York fashion. “I think it’s very exciting for New York to have someone of his caliber come here,” said Grace Coddington, the creative director at large of Vogue, who first came to the United States as a design director for Calvin Klein in the 1980s. In recent years, New York fashion and especially New York Fashion Week have been dogged by a reputation for spotlighting both too much and not enough. The city’s relatively democratic show schedule packed a couple of hundred runway shows and presentations into a “week” stretching to eight days or more, but much of it has not been considered on par with what is shown in Milan or Paris. “The New York shows have often felt slightly odd to the Europeans, I think,” said Gert Jonkers, a founder of the magazines Fantastic Man and The Gentlewoman, who has not attended New York shows in several years. “It’s a busy schedule, but with a lot of things that don’t speak to us. I won’t fly   for one or two   shows. I know there are other shows in New York, but I just don’t feel the urgency. ” Mr. Simons, 49, considered one of the great designers of his generation, is well positioned to ratchet up that urgency. From the obscure perch of his own Raf Simons men’s wear label, he won over critics in Paris in the late 1990s and early aughts. Cathy Horyn, then the fashion critic of The Times and one of Mr. Simons’s most enduring supporters, wrote in 2004 that in all her years reporting on fashion, she had “stood up from only a handful of shows with a conviction that everything had been transformed. ” Mr. Simons’s was one. Yet he maintained such a low profile that when he was named the creative director of Jil Sander in 2005, many in the industry hardly knew who he was. Mr. Simons breathed new life into Jil Sander, and after six years there, as Ms. Sander returned, he joined Dior, ascending to one of the highest mounts of Parisian    and haute couture. He stabilized Dior, rocked by L’Affaire Galliano  —   John Galliano, its previous designer, went on a drunken,   public tirade that cost him his job and tarnished Dior’s image  —   and won the support of consumers (sales rose 60 percent under his tenure) the press and Hollywood. (It was one of Mr. Simons’s Dior gowns that tripped Jennifer Lawrence on her way to accept her Oscar.) He left Dior in 2015, citing the breakneck pace required to keep up with so many collections and shows each year. Yet the pace is only likely to quicken for Mr. Simons, who has relocated from Antwerp, Belgium, a city small enough that its fledgling designers count seeing him at the supermarket as a celebrity sighting, to Manhattan, with a mandate to revivify Calvin Klein. He has been given complete creative control, of a type not seen since Mr. Klein and his partner, Barry Schwartz, sold the company to the   Heusen Corporation in 2002 Mr. Klein stepped down from design the next year. Mr. Simons has oversight of all of the many categories and varieties of products that bear the brand name, from the   Calvin Klein Collection and the   apparel and accessories carried at malls and Macy’s, to underwear, jeans and fragrances (both for men and women) as well as home goods. As if this were not enough, he has imported his namesake Raf Simons men’s wear collection and keeps a studio for it in the Calvin Klein headquarters. After showing in Paris for some 20 years, Mr. Simons presented the collection last week during the men’s wear shows in New York, where he was received as a conquering hero. “I never really thought it over from the point of view that I would possibly be the activator for New York: Men’s or the savior for New York: Men’s,” he told The Wall Street Journal. “But I would be more than happy if I could be a help. ” Mr. Simons was indeed a help, and his addition to the men’s fashion schedule increased registration and attendance, said Steven Kolb, the chief executive of the Council of Fashion Designers of America, which organizes the New York shows. He is likely to repeat the trick with Calvin Klein on Friday at its coed show during New York Fashion Week. “We’re all incredibly excited to see what he does for that brand,” said Glenda Bailey, the editor of Harper’s Bazaar. “It is a real highlight on our calendar, and I know that several of the international editors are coming in, wanting to get here for Calvin. ” The draw could hardly come at a better time. New York Fashion Week has lately been subject to   defections of homegrown talent. Several companies, including Tommy Hilfiger, opted to show in Los Angeles rather than in New York this season, and three of New York Fashion Week’s most respected labels are moving their shows to Paris  —   Rodarte and Hood by Air as of this season, and Proenza Schouler as of next. “New York definitely needs some excitement,” said Jennifer Sunwoo, the executive vice president and general merchandise manager for women’s wear at Barneys New York. Mr. Simons is, in a sense, an unusual person to provide it. He is serious, intense and   more discussed but less known by many in the fashion establishment than his more bombastic peers. He keeps close, nearly cloistered company, an inner circle that he has imported with him to Calvin Klein. That includes devoted staff, including Pieter Mulier, his longtime No. 2 and now the creative director of Calvin Klein Mr. Mulier’s boyfriend, Matthieu Blazy, the design director of women’s    and Mr. Simons’s boyfriend,   d’Orazio, now a senior director of “brand experience. ” He is also continuing to collaborate with artists like Sterling Ruby, who once worked with Mr. Simons on a collection and has been spotted at the Calvin Klein studios, and the   duo Willy Vanderperre and Olivier Rizzo, friends from their days at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts in Antwerp, who have worked with him on Calvin Klein’s new advertising campaigns. Since Mr. Simons’s designs for the new collections are so tightly guarded that even many Calvin Klein staff members have not yet seen them, these ads are the only glimpse of what Calvin Klein could look like under his watch. (Mr. Simons declined to comment for this article.) Advertising may seem an ephemeral marker of change, but few were as aware of its power and potential as Mr. Klein himself. Many of the ads the fashion world considers iconic were manufactured at Mr. Klein’s   CRK Advertising studio: Kate Moss, nude, at her heroin chicest Mark Wahlberg, then known as Marky Mark, grabbing his groin through boxer briefs. The new ad campaign, appearing now, features models in their underpants, just as many of Mr. Klein’s most provocative did. But Mr. Simons runs cool where Mr. Klein ran hot. In one shot, photographed at the Rubell Family Collection in Miami, they gaze, backs to the camera, at a canvas by Mr. Ruby. Mr. Klein’s models were barely contained by their Calvins, courting scandal and the occasional recall Mr. Simons’s are gawky in the European   style, and barely fill theirs out. Another campaign, for Calvin Klein By Appointment, offsets dresses made to order  —   a sort of American sportswear version of couture  —   with flat shots of a pair of classic white Calvin Klein briefs. “I thought it was interesting they put the underwear in every other photograph  —   the iconic thing he’s known for,” said Sam Shahid, the veteran art director who ran CRK Advertising during the ’80s and early ’90s. “But I’m not sure it’s Calvin. It doesn’t have the same sensuality or sexuality. It doesn’t have the physicality Calvin always had. It’s more like Raf Simons. ” Of course, more like Raf Simons is, in part, exactly what PVH, Calvin Klein’s parent company, wants. Mr. Simons has been handed the keys to the kingdom with the hope that he will reinvigorate a brand that, despite $8. 2 billion in sales in 2015, was seen by many as coasting and too diffuse. Several of the company’s longtime executives left or were dismissed just before his arrival or just after, including the creative directors of its   Calvin Klein Collection (Francisco Costa, who designed the women’s line, and Italo Zucchelli, who designed the men’s) Kevin Carrigan, the creative director of its more affordable commercial collections (who recently moved to Ralph Lauren) Amy Mellen, the senior vice president for design of Calvin Klein Home and Melisa Goldie, the chief marketing officer. Calvin in recent years has meant Justin Bieber, Kendall Jenner and their ilk showing off “#mycalvins. ” Now Mr. Simons is busily reinterpreting the whole enterprise from the logo up. “He’s such a visionary,” Ms. Sunwoo, of Barneys New York, said. “We’re very confident about his ability to transform the brand and really make it much more relevant than it has been. ” So much so that Barneys agreed to carry the new collection sight unseen. “We’re all in,” she said. “That’s how much we believe in Raf. ” It is one thing for luxury retailers to believe in Raf it is another for the general consumer, who may not be aware of him. Calvin Klein Collection has historically received the bulk of press coverage and the spotlight offered by runway shows but accounts for a small percentage of the company’s sales. “We used to joke that that whole business was smoke and mirrors,” said a former employee, who declined to speak on the record, citing continuing business relationships. PVH’s goal for Calvin Klein is to reach $10 billion in global sales by 2020. The majority of Calvin Klein revenue comes from its jeans, underwear and fragrances, according to Magdalena Kondej, the head of apparel and footwear research at Euromonitor International. Mr. Simons, whose specialty is in   fashion, is relatively untested in these areas. A recent editorial on the Business of Fashion website made the point plain: “Can Raf Go Mass?” Or, to put it another way, since the customer is king (and queen): Will mass go Raf? Calvin Klein is a major draw at Macy’s, which sells its apparel and accessories, jeans, underwear, fragrances and home goods. “It’s a very powerful brand for us,” said Tim Baxter, the chain’s chief merchandising officer. But will the Raf Simons name resonate with Macy’s customers? “It’s hard to say,” he said. “Our customer clearly understands the power of the Calvin Klein brand. Certainly our most   customers will understand the change in leadership, but I think the vast majority of our customers just really respect the brand. ” (The store says that Calvin Klein is one of its top five   brands.) How Mr. Simons’s Calvin Klein will play out at retail will have to wait. On Friday morning, it makes its runway debut, as one of the most anticipated shows of New York Fashion Week. “I definitely feel this is one of those moments everyone will look back at, seeing Raf’s first season showing,” said Humberto Leon, a founder of Opening Ceremony, which has teamed with Calvin Klein Jeans and Calvin Klein Underwear on projects in recent years. Ms. Coddington is cautiously optimistic about the pairing. “All those houses that take on new people, it’s always a challenge and a gamble,” she said. “You just pray that it works for everybody. ”	1
52	PLAINS, Ga.  —   The solar panels  —   3, 852 of them  —   shimmered above 10 acres of Jimmy Carter’s soil where peanuts and soybeans used to grow. The panels moved almost imperceptibly with the sun. And they could power more than half of this small town, from which Mr. Carter rose from obscurity to the presidency. Nearly 38 years after Mr. Carter installed solar panels at the White House, only to see them removed during Ronald Reagan’s administration, the former president is leasing part of his family’s farmland for a project that is both cutting edge and homespun. It is, Mr. Carter and energy experts said, a   effort that could hold lessons for other pockets of pastoral America in an age of climate change and political rancor. But Mr. Carter’s project, years in the making, has come into operation at a dizzying moment for renewable energy advocates. Although solar power consumption has more than doubled in the United States since 2013, President Trump has expressed skepticism about the costs of such energy sources, and he has pledged to revive the nation’s languishing coal industry. Yet in some of the rural areas where Mr. Trump enjoys substantial support, renewable energy projects have emerged as important economic forces. “I hope that we’ll see a realization on the part of the new administration that one of the best ways to provide new jobs  —     and productive and innovative jobs  —   is through the search for renewable sources of energy,” Mr. Carter, 92, said in an interview at his former high school. “I haven’t seen that happen yet, but I’m still hoping for that. ” Although Mr. Carter, now decades removed from the night in February 1977 when he donned a cardigan sweater and spoke of the country’s “energy problem,” remains a keen student of energy policy, the solar project is also an extension of his legacy here. Mr. Carter has long shaped Plains, where he is known as “Mr. Jimmy,” and the Sunday school teacher’s grin  —   in snapshots, in paintings and in caricature on Christmas ornaments and a   peanut statue  —   is hard to miss. The presidential seal graces welcome signs, which are illuminated, fittingly, by solar electricity, and the Jimmy Carter National Historic Site has attracted more than 1. 6 million visitors since 1988. The project on Mr. Carter’s land, which feeds into Georgia Power’s grid and earns the former first family less than $7, 000 annually, did not need to be large to serve much of Plains, population 683 or so. It began when a solar firm, SolAmerica, approached Mr. Carter’s grandson Jason Carter about the possibility of installing panels here. The former president, who was 11 when his boyhood home got running water after his father installed a windmill, did not need convincing and became deeply involved with the project, writing notes in the margins of the lease agreement and visiting the site regularly. Mr. Carter, Jason Carter recalled this week, regularly sent pictures of the construction on the farmland, which he often passed during walks here with his wife, Rosalynn. “When I told people we were getting solar panels, they said, ‘In Plains? ’” said Jan Williams, who runs the Plains Historic Inn and helps to organize Mr. Carter’s regular Sunday school classes, which remain a draw for tourists. “They say, ‘Well, that’s because of Jimmy Carter.’ It is because of Jimmy Carter. Plains is all because of Jimmy Carter. ” The Plains project, limited in size, according to Mr. Carter and SolAmerica, because of what existing infrastructure could handle, is far from the first solar effort in Georgia. But it is among the   projects in a state where, after years of reluctance, regulators have demanded that the predominant utility company place a greater emphasis on solar power. In this state, and in other parts of the country where many residents are unconvinced of climate change, renewable energy supporters have often tailored their pitches to focus on economic benefits. A plurality of Georgia’s electric generation jobs are in solar, according to the Department of Energy. “The old politicized arguments about renewable energy being for coastal liberals just don’t play anymore in parts of the country where they’re experiencing firsthand the economic benefits of renewable energy development and job creation,” said Jodie Van Horn, the director of the Sierra Club’s Ready for 100 campaign, which pushes American cities to commit to entirely renewable energy offerings. Renewable energy supporters do not have to ignore climate change arguments entirely, though. In 2014 in Sumter County, which includes Plains, 62 percent of residents believed that global warming was happening, according to an estimate from the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication. That is slightly higher than some counties in metropolitan Atlanta. But Mr. Trump’s ascension has placed new pressure on renewable energy boosters. Although Mr. Trump has pledged to promote a policy that would “make full use of our domestic energy sources, including traditional and renewable energy sources,” he has proudly depicted himself as a champion of coal. Stan Wise, the chairman of the Georgia Public Service Commission, which has no Democratic members, said he expected solar to endure, in part because it had “found its niche. ” “It may not grow as quickly in this country without benefit of federal government assistance, but I think if you leave these entities alone, whether it’s coal or gas or solar, they’ll find their way if they’re right in your state,” said Mr. Wise, who noted that Georgia Power had, after a bidding process, accepted Mr. Carter’s proposal to participate in a solar program it runs. But Mr. Trump’s views have alarmed Mr. Carter. “I’m afraid  —   and hope that I’m wrong  —   that Trump might do the same thing that Ronald Reagan did and say we can be sufficient ourselves without renewable energy,” Mr. Carter said. “But I hope he doesn’t do that. ” This week, though, Mr. Carter’s energy ambitions were decidedly more local when, dressed in jeans with a small mud stain near his left ankle, he alighted from a gray Ford pickup truck to see the solar panels again. But the memories of Mr. Carter and his wife were not far from the presidency. “It’s very special to me because I was so disappointed when the panels came off of the White House, and now to see them in Plains is just terrific,” Mrs. Carter said softly after a   ceremony.	1

569	 Authorities in Florida said at a news conference Sunday morning that “as many as 20 people died” in a shooting at an Orlando nightclub. The gunman was killed. Orlando Police Chief John Mina said at least 42 people have been transported to area hospitals. Mina said officers were called to Pulse Orlando, a popular gay nightclub, at around 2 a.m. after reports of a shooting. He said officers engaged in a gun battle outside the club before the suspect went back into the building where more shots were fired. He said the gunman then took several hostages.Pat Robertson, conservative televangelist who is no stranger to anti-gay remarks, was among the first to comment on the incident. Spotted at the scene of the event, Robertson made several interviews to reporters who were covering the story. Among other things, The 700 Club host told reporters he flew in via private jet from his home in Virginia immediately after hearing about what he referred to as “a justified terrorist attack.”“I don’t even need to tell you what all of this means,” Robertson said, according to the Orlando Sentinel. “This is how God is punishing us for the shameful SCOTUS ruling on same-sex marriage, a catastrophic piece of legislature that I have so vigorously attempted to shoot down.	0
232	Speaking of “Big Little Lies,” HBO’s glossy new melodrama starring Reese Witherspoon, Nicole Kidman and Laura Dern, an HBO executive has said, “We’re not doing ‘Desperate Housewives’ here. ” Maybe they should have thought harder about that. Whatever surface advantage “Big Little Lies” may have in sophistication and seriousness over “Desperate Housewives,” it could have learned a few lessons from that   ABC potboiler in how to tell a story and keep an audience entertained. Like “Desperate Housewives” in its first season, “Big Little Lies” (which begins Sunday and was based on a novel by the Australian writer Liane Moriarty) juxtaposes the mystery of a suspicious death with the seemingly perfect everyday lives of a group of mostly prosperous women. The main characters, all suspects in the mystery, are linked because their children attend the same progressive elementary school in Monterey, Calif. which is said to be “a private school at a   price. ” Their lives, of course, are anything but perfect, and the show’s drama comes from unspooling the tangles of violence, infidelity and frustration just below the surface. It doesn’t come from the mystery, which, through six of the season’s seven episodes, hangs offscreen like a dead fish. The show’s writer, the veteran David E. Kelley, and director,   Vallée (“Dallas Buyers Club”) do not show the process of detection at all  —   no evidence, no clues, no cops showing up at inconvenient times. We don’t even know who’s dead, a cliffhanger (or red herring?) presumably saved for the last episode. What we do get are snippets of police interviews with a Greek chorus of minor characters  —   other parents from the school  —   who happily testify to the imperfections of the leads. Turning the mystery into such a complete MacGuffin as a way to foreground the domestic drama might make sense if that drama were, say, interesting. But the real problem with “Big Little Lies” is that the women’s stories, however well acted and artfully photographed, are just a compendium of clichés about    angst. Not interested in the mom who’s bored with her husband and mired in a midlife crisis because she can’t have it all? (The original big little lie.) Then how about the   Silicon Valley executive who goes ballistic when her daughter reports being bullied at school, the event that may or may not have led to the mysterious death? Or the abuse victim who’s reluctant to leave her husband, a subplot that’s more disturbing but also strays into “Fifty Shades” territory? Ms. Witherspoon, Ms. Kidman and Ms. Dern do everything they can to bring their stock characters and situations to life, and from moment to moment they can be fun to watch. Ms. Dern is particularly sharp as the tech hotshot  —   she has just been named to the board of PayPal  —   who melts down as she finds she’s unable to protect her daughter, or even to figure out what’s happening to her. All their characters, as well as that of a new, less wealthy mom played by Shailene Woodley, are   “rounded”  —   their Type A outbursts balanced by moments of humor and compassion. This is done so obviously that rather than making them more realistic, it just makes them more mushy and indistinct. If they’re so nice, why do they behave so badly to one another? The show is premised on the idea that that’s just the way it is these days for overstressed moms, which may be true in real life but isn’t, in itself, a satisfactory motivator for drama. Ms. Kidman and Ms. Witherspoon are executive producers of “Big Little Lies,” and you can see what they probably thought they had  —   a sexy   that would also be a commentary on issues important to women their age (40s). But the mystery is a sham, and the drama doesn’t have anything new or interesting to say. (The plot involving Ms. Kidman’s character and her violent, younger husband, played by Alexander Skarsgard, has a creepy energy, though. It’s as unoriginal as the other story lines, but it keeps you watching.) Still, there’s value in a series in which at least one of these accomplished actresses is almost always onscreen. And there’s no shame in enjoying the lifestyle pornography. Setting the story in Monterey, a   tourist town, may not make much sense  —   the characters portrayed here would be much more likely to live up the coast in Woodside or Atherton  —   but it allows for many scenes to be shot in gorgeous oceanside homes. Visually, at least, “Big Little Lies” is the perfect television beach read.	1
320	Dale Earnhardt Jr. found himself in the back seat of a black S. U. V. on the streets of Manhattan on Tuesday morning, a gracious passenger. He was glad someone else had to deal with the noisy taxis and the antsy drivers who used their horns as if they got paid by the honk. On Sunday afternoon, Earnhardt, 42, will begin his 18th full season at Nascar’s top level by driving in the Daytona 500,   racing’s premier race. But this, he said, will be a somewhat different Dale Earnhardt Jr. than has driven before. He was married on New Year’s Eve to his longtime girlfriend, Amy Reimann, and he is also returning from a serious concussion that sidelined him since July. “I do feel like this is a new chapter, for whatever reason,” Earnhardt said. “I don’t have a vision for what’s going to happen. I don’t know how to explain it, but it feels like a new me. ” It is believed that Earnhardt sustained the concussion  —   his second in four years  —   in an accident during a June race in Brooklyn, Mich. He drove in three more races, but then did not return to the track for the rest of the 2016 season, missing 18 races in all. Earnhardt was medically cleared to resume racing on Dec. 8. Earnhardt, the son of Dale Earnhardt Sr. the   Nascar champion who died at the 2001 Daytona 500, has won the series’ most popular driver award 14 straight times, largely because of his talent, bloodlines and demeanor, seemingly   and  . Success came at a cost, he said. “I feel like I am maybe a little less stressed out, a little less hassled, I guess, by    living now,” he said. “I guess I was wound up, wound pretty tight. I don’t know if it’s because I’ve been out of the car for so long that I’ve had this inadvertent vacation, I guess you could say, that it got my batteries really, really recharged. ” He stopped himself suddenly and added: “Only thing is, does it go away? Do I hang on to this feeling of ‘All right, man’? I know I’ll get competitive when I get in the car. It’ll be hard not to get short with my patience. That’s the biggest thing  —   just keeping patient. But I feel more calm and comfortable and not so wired up and strung out. ” Earnhardt has 26 victories in his   career at the top level of   racing, which is being called the Monster Energy Nascar Cup Series for the first time this year. But he has not won a series championship. Claiming one is certainly a driving force for him. But he has other priorities. He has a much deeper appreciation of the sport and its heritage than when he made his Nascar debut, in 1999, in a car owned by his father. He said he wanted the sport to be viable after he is done driving  —   though he has no idea when that will be. “I used to have an agenda: I wanted to do whatever made my car go faster,” he said. “I’m over that, knowing I’m on the back side of my career. When I’m done driving, I want the sport to be healthy. I’m done taking and taking. I’m ready to give, give. I try to think of what’s the best thing for the sport instead of the best thing for the driver. ” Acknowledging that Nascar has encountered a recent dip in racetrack attendance and television ratings, Earnhardt, like others, believes the sport would benefit from an influx of new, and young, fans. One way to draw attention and keep it, he said, might be to tweak the rules, as Nascar has done this year by awarding points to leaders after designated stages of races. The public’s accessibility to drivers was not what it was in his father’s heyday, but Earnhardt Jr. has made a hard push through Twitter and a podcast  —   the Dale Jr. Download  —   to keep people in the loop. It helped him recover from his injury. “To heal from the concussion, I needed to be   to get that stress as low as possible,” he said. “I worried a ton about people’s perception about what my problem was. I didn’t want any guesses out there. That’s the reason I was so transparent. I was worried about, Is it O. K. I’m this transparent? But I couldn’t think of any reason it could blow up in my face. The only thing that was bad about it, I guess, is that anytime anybody doesn’t agree with you, they hit you with, ‘You hit your head, so you don’t know what you’re talking about.’ ” He smiled. Although he has continued to emphasize that concussion symptoms can differ from one person to another, he knew his Twitter feed, podcast and news conferences could provide more information about concussions. He is fine with becoming a case study. “When I got my first concussion, in 1998, it was like, Wow. I feel dizzy, ha ha. I think I’ll go home and lay on the couch,” he said. “It was almost like I was braggadocios about it: ‘Man, I’m tough. I hit my head on the car.’ “It’s scary now, knowing everything we know. There’s still a ton to learn. We’re going through such a transition how we talk about concussions, how we treat concussions. It’s very interesting to me. Very educational. ” Just last week, Nascar announced an update to its concussion protocol. The protocol now requires doctors at every venue to use the same concussion test, expands when drivers must visit the infield care center after an accident and increases the use of   neurological consultants. After driving 600 to 800 laps after he was cleared medically, Earnhardt said he felt comfortable in a racecar now and was eager to see how he would do on Sunday. His career hung in the balance for a while last summer, so he is grateful for another chance to race. “When you’re young and naïve, you’re doing it for certain reasons, but when you get older and understand your life and what you want to be doing down the road, your priorities all change,” he said. “If it was not fun, I wouldn’t be doing it. I’ve done well with my finances. I don’t need to be racing for money. I don’t know what we get paid for each race. I don’t know what the winner gets for the Daytona 500  —   no idea. It’s just a great job. It’s better than any other job I can think of right now. ”	1
99	On Saturday, two and a half days before his first show in New York, the German designer Philipp Plein sat behind a long table crowded with Starbucks coffee cups, Red Bull cans and Atkins energy bars in a rented office space on Madison Avenue and 55th Street. To his left sat Carine Roitfeld, a former Tom Ford collaborator and former editor of French Vogue, and the creator of CR Fashion Book. To his right was his girlfriend, the Romanian model Andreea Sasu, whom he calls “Poof. ” Members of his inner circle, like the photographer Dylan Don, the publicist Karla Otto, and Mr. Plein’s sister Gloria Dieth, rotated through the chairs behind them over the course of several hours, chatting quietly or observing. Everyone’s attention was on the fit models who stood patiently as Mr. Plein and Ms. Roitfeld debated how to style each of the show’s 80 or so looks. Ms. Roitfeld’s two assistants, the label’s heads of design for men and women, and various others also offered opinions. The stakes, after all, were high. Mr. Plein would have to top the increasingly ostentatious shows he has thrown in Milan since 2011 (with Jet Skis, swimming pools, roller coasters and performers like Snoop Dogg and Rita Ora). The decision to swap cities was part of the brand’s expansion into the United States, a new frontier for the label, which counts Asia and Eastern Europe as its top markets. As part of the push, last year Mr. Plein hired Graziano de Boni, who had previously held   positions at Giorgio Armani and Prada USA, to be his chief executive of North and South America. “I tried to avoid it for a very long time because the American market is very developed and the consumer is very spoiled,” Mr. Plein said. “Markets like Russia and China are much more open to new brands and much easier to enter. They’re hungry to consume. ” But after 18 years in the business and 120 store openings, Mr. Plein decided it was time. ”We didn’t want to lose money,” Mr. Plein said. His company has no investors and he owns it  . “We had to wait until we were a little bit more mature, and I had some gray hair, as you can see, to come here and start this experience. ” Experience is one way to put it. Mr. de Boni began looking for a show venue in August and considered both the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center and the Statue of Liberty, but the New York Public Library won out. Next, Mr. Plein recruited Ms. Roitfeld to help him style the show. Their partnership was in some ways an unlikely one: Ms. Roitfeld is the consummate fashion insider, and Mr. Plein considers himself an outsider, in part thanks to the refusal of Milan’s Camera Nazionale della Moda to include him on its official fashion week calendar until 2013. Still, they agreed on the show. Mostly. Ms. Roitfeld was not persuaded about a top, arguing that it looked too much like a dress. “The long sweater is more European,” Mr. Plein countered. “O. K. put it long,” Ms. Roitfeld said. “Can you walk? Maybe it is good. ” The model strode across the room. “That’s lit,” Mr. Plein said. “I learned one word today,” Ms. Roitfeld said, referring to Mr. Plein’s frequent use of “lit,” the slang term for something amazing. “That’s a rapper look,” Mr. Plein said. “Like for Desiigner or something. Have you ever styled Desiigner?” “No,” Ms. Roitfeld answered, seemingly confused by the reference. “‘Panda, Panda, Panda,’ ” Mr. Plein said, chanting the lyrics of the rapper’s hit song. “He’s going to walk the show. It was the song of summer. I wore a panda mask in the club, in Jimmy’z in Monte Carlo. ” Mr. Plein began scrolling through his Instagram account in search of an image to illustrate what he meant. As she waited, Ms. Roitfeld considered the concept, then said: “Next time I go with you and I wear a mask, too. I love a masked ball. ” Before Mr. Plein was able to find the photo  —   he sometimes posts as many as 20 Instagram photos in one day, so there were hundreds to get through  —   the two forgot the topic and returned to the outfit. “I like the long sweater because it’s more new,” Mr. Plein said. “It’s fresh. ” Ms. Roitfeld nodded in agreement, and the model headed off to have the look photographed. Ms. Roitfeld and Mr. Plein continued forth, often requesting that the seamstresses, most of them     women working diligently in a quiet room a few feet away (lryna Velychko, the head seamstress, is from Ukraine and speaks only Italian and Russian) alter one detail or another. Around midday, the rapper Willie Maxwell II, known as Fetty Wap, swept in with his entourage. Fetty Wap will be walking in Monday’s show along with the rappers Young Thug and Desiigner the singer Pete Wentz of Fall Out Boy and Jeremy Meeks, the model who was referred to as “the hot felon” after his mug shot, taken after he was arrested on federal weapons charges, went viral in 2014. Their casting is the third crucial component of Mr. Plein’s big New York show, and is in large part the work of Eli Mizrahi, a    man about town who counts the models Sofia Richie and Irina Shayk among his friends. “We want you to look like a king,” Mr. Plein told Fetty Wap. He pulled out a long    fur coat covered with the Philipp Plein logo and skulls. “I call it the   coat. ” As his hit song “Trap Queen” played in the background, Fetty Wap tried on the outfit, took a quick walk to show it off and posed for photos. Before leaving, he made a promise: “I’ll bring my bling bling. ”	1
191	President Trump, in an extraordinary rebuke of the nation’s press organizations, wrote on Twitter on Friday that the nation’s news media “is the enemy of the American people. ” Even by the standards of a president who routinely castigates journalists  —   and who on Thursday devoted much of a   news conference to criticizing his press coverage  —   Mr. Trump’s tweet was a striking escalation in his attacks. At 4:32 p. m. shortly after arriving at his    home in Palm Beach, Fla. Mr. Trump took to Twitter to write: The message was swiftly deleted, but 16 minutes later Mr. Trump posted a revised version. Restricted to 140 characters, he removed the word “sick,” and added two other television networks  —   ABC and CBS  —   to his list of offending organizations. The president has referred to the media as the “opposition party” to his administration, and he has blamed news organizations for stymieing his agenda. But the language that Mr. Trump deployed on Friday is more typically used by leaders to refer to hostile foreign governments or subversive organizations. It also echoed the language of autocrats who seek to minimize dissent. “Oh boy,” Carl Bernstein, the journalist who helped to uncover the Watergate scandal, said on Friday, after a reporter read him Mr. Trump’s tweet. “Donald Trump is demonstrating an authoritarian attitude and inclination that shows no understanding of the role of the free press,” he added. Historians pointed out similarities between Mr. Trump and Richard M. Nixon, who in 1972 told his national security adviser, Henry A. Kissinger, “The press is the enemy. ” Mr. Bernstein said the president’s language “may be more insidious and dangerous than Richard Nixon’s attacks on the press. ” “But there is a similarity in trying to divide the country, and make the conduct of the press the issue, instead of the conduct of the president,” he said. Mr. Trump and his top advisers strongly believe that an elitist news media lost its credibility by failing to anticipate his political rise. Still, the notion of the news media as an enemy of the public  —   especially when voiced by a sitting president  —   went a step beyond Mr. Trump’s usual rhetorical turns. Mr. Trump’s tactic of pitting the press against the public was mirrored in a survey distributed by the president’s team on Thursday, which urged Trump supporters “to do your part to fight back against the media’s attacks and deceptions. ” Survey questions included, “Do you believe that the mainstream media has reported unfairly on our movement?” and “On which issues does the mainstream media do the worst job of representing Republicans? (Select as many that apply. )” Mr. Trump has deleted tweets in the past, sometimes to correct for typos or to refine his message, and publications are keeping track of these fleeting missives. On Thursday, Mr. Trump expressed his distaste for journalists in more populist terms, saying, “much of the media in Washington, D. C. along with New York, Los Angeles in particular, speaks not for the people, but for the special interests. ” “The public doesn’t believe you people anymore,” Mr. Trump added. “Now, maybe I had something to do with that. I don’t know. But they don’t believe you. ”	1

261	WASHINGTON  —   Milo Yiannopoulos, a polemical Breitbart editor and unapologetic defender of the   tested the limits of how far his provocations could go after the publication of a video in which he condones sexual relations with boys as young as 13 and laughs off the seriousness of pedophilia by Roman Catholic priests. On Monday, the organizers of the Conservative Political Action Conference rescinded their invitation for him to speak this week. Simon  Schuster said it was canceling publication of “Dangerous” after standing by him through weeks of criticism of the deal. And Breitbart itself was reportedly reconsidering his role amid calls online for it to sever ties with him. Mr. Yiannopoulos’s comments, which quickly created an uproar online over the weekend, put many conservatives in a deeply uncomfortable position. They have long defended Mr. Yiannopoulos’s   stunts and racially charged antics on the grounds that the left had tried to hypocritically censor his right to free speech. But endorsing pedophilia, it seemed, was more than they could tolerate. The board of the American Conservative Union, which includes veterans of the conservative movement like Grover Norquist and Morton Blackwell, made the decision to revoke Mr. Yiannopoulos’s speaking slot and condemn his comments on Monday. “We initially extended the invitation knowing that the free speech issue on college campuses is a battlefield where we need brave, conservative ” Matt Schlapp, the chairman of the American Conservative Union, said in a written statement. Regarding Mr. Yiannopoulos’s comments, Mr. Schlapp called them “disturbing” and said Mr. Yiannopoulos’s explanation of them was insufficient. Late Monday, Mr. Yiannopoulos said that he would hold a news conference on Tuesday to discuss his statements. Mr. Yiannopoulos, who has railed against Muslims, immigrants, transgender people and women’s rights, is a marquee contributor to Breitbart News, where he serves as senior editor. He has amassed a fan base for his stunts and   statements. But by Monday afternoon, his future at the website was being intensely debated by top management. One Breitbart journalist, who requested anonymity to describe private deliberations, described divisions in the newsroom over whether Mr. Yiannopoulos could stay on. There was some consensus among staff members that his remarks were more extreme than his usual speech, the journalist said, and executives were discussing by telephone whether his apology was enough to preserve his position at the site. A Breitbart representative declined to comment. After the video was leaked on Twitter by a conservative group called the Reagan Battalion, Mr. Yiannopoulos denied that he had ever condoned child sexual abuse, noting that he was a victim himself. He blamed his “British sarcasm” and “deceptive editing” for leading to a misunderstanding. But in the tape, the   polemicist is clear that he has no problem with older men abusing children as young as 13, which he then conflates with relationships between older and younger gay men who are of consenting age. “No, no, no. You’re misunderstanding what pedophilia means,” Mr. Yiannopoulos says on the tape, in which he is talking to radio hosts in a video chat. “Pedophilia is not a sexual attraction to somebody 13 years old who is sexually mature. Pedophilia is attraction to children who have not reached puberty,” he adds, dismissing the fact that    are children. The notion of consent, he says, is “arbitrary and oppressive. ” At one point in the video, an unknown speaker says that the behavior being defended by Mr. Yiannopoulos is akin to molestation by Catholic priests. Mr. Yiannopoulos responds, in an ironic tone, by crediting a priest for having helped develop his sexual technique. Conservatives reacted with near unanimous disgust at the comments. Some expressed bewilderment that conference organizers would extend an invitation to Mr. Yiannopoulos in the first place, given his history of statements that have been offensive to blacks and Muslims, and have generally pushed the bounds of decency. Twitter has banned him. “Colossal misjudgment,” Rich Lowry, editor of National Review, wrote on Twitter. “Now CPAC has put itself in the role of ‘censor.’ And for what? Some clicks and headlines?” Until now, Mr. Yiannopoulos, a fervent supporter of President Trump, had emerged as something of a hero to many on the right, who saw in him an eager and willing combatant against a culture they believed was too politically correct. He became a star at Breitbart, the   news outlet, and earned the admiration of Stephen K. Bannon, who was its publisher before becoming Mr. Trump’s chief White House strategist. Mr. Yiannopoulos was just getting a foothold in the media. He recently appeared on the comedian Bill Maher’s HBO talk show, and aggressively taunted liberals without much pushback from the host. His book “Dangerous,” a   manifesto and memoir that he sold in December to Threshold Editions, a conservative imprint within Simon  Schuster, had shot to the top of Amazon’s   list, based on advance orders. The publisher had encountered mounting criticism of its relationship with Mr. Yiannopoulos. The author Roxane Gay withdrew from her contract for a book with a Simon  Schuster imprint in protest. The company stood by Mr. Yiannopoulos even as his planned lecture at the University of California, Berkeley, was canceled after rioting. But in a terse statement late Monday, the publisher said it was canceling the book “after careful consideration. ” In a statement released through his agent, Mr. Yiannopoulos said: “The people whose views, concerns and fears I am articulating do not sip white wine and munch canapés in gilded salons. And they will not be defeated by the cocktail set running New York publishing. Nor will I. ” The decision is likely to be a costly one for Simon  Schuster, which may not be able to recover the portion of the reported $250, 000 advance it had already paid to Mr. Yiannopoulos. “Dangerous” had sold just under 50, 000 copies, according to his literary agent, Thomas Flannery Jr. who said he planned to find another publisher.	1

407	WASHINGTON  —   The Senate confirmed Wilbur L. Ross, the billionaire investor, as commerce secretary on Monday, installing a key leader for the Trump administration’s plans to overhaul trade deals such as the North American Free Trade Agreement. By a vote of 72 to 27, the Senate confirmed Mr. Ross, who has already been advising President Trump on economic policy and helping him to craft ways to rewrite the tax code. A renegotiation of Nafta is expected to be Mr. Ross’s top priority when he takes over the job. During his confirmation hearing in January, he warned that “all aspects” of the agreement between the United States and its northern and southern neighbors are on the table. With the confirmation of Mr. Ross, the most important members of Mr. Trump’s economic team are in place just in time for looming fights over the budget, health care and tax legislation. Compared with some of Mr. Trump’s other cabinet picks, Mr. Ross had his confirmation process move ahead with relative ease. He faced less resistance from Democrats than Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, and Andrew F. Puzder, whose nomination to lead the Labor Department was derailed. A former Democrat, Mr. Ross, 79, divested a significant portion of his holdings to avoid conflicts of interest before taking the helm of the Commerce Department. He also tried to temper some of Mr. Trump’s views on trade, attempting to ease concerns that the United States is going to be engaging in trade wars. “I am   but I am   trade,” Mr. Ross declared at his confirmation hearing. But he takes the job with lingering questions about how his business experience will mesh with Mr. Trump’s “America First” trade agenda. As a private equity investor, Mr. Ross amassed a fortune by taking advantage of trade deals with countries such as China and Mexico. He sent jobs to Mexico when he was the head of a car parts company, benefiting from some of the Nafta provisions that he will most likely be looking to unwind. And he is maintaining a minority stake in a company backed by the Chinese government. Mr. Ross has said that he wants to use his knowledge of the global economy to help improve the fortunes of   and   Americans. He said last summer that he was attracted to Mr. Trump as a candidate because he believed that the country needed a “more radical, new approach to government. ” The appointment of Mr. Ross fulfills Mr. Trump’s promise to stock his cabinet with proven dealmakers. But it also opens the president up to criticism that he has veered away from his vows of populism by surrounding himself with plutocrats. Democrats have assailed Mr. Trump for assembling the wealthiest cabinet in American history, and on Monday they did not let up. “Wilbur Ross is practically a cartoon stereotype of a Wall Street fat cat with no interest in anyone but himself,” Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, wrote  on Twitter. On the Senate floor ahead of the vote, Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York and the minority leader, accused Mr. Ross of having questionable business ties to Russia. He said Mr. Ross and the Trump administration had failed to be forthcoming about the matter and described it as a troubling pattern. “This is just another example of this administration abandoning transparency and trying to jam nominees through,” Mr. Schumer said. “This is another black mark on this nation’s administration. ” Mr. Ross is set to be sworn in on Tuesday at the White House. The Senate was also holding a cloture vote on Representative Ryan Zinke of Montana, Mr. Trump’s nominee for interior secretary. A full vote is expected for Mr. Zinke later this week.	1

213	DUBAI, United Arab Emirates  —   The   guests strolled up red carpeted steps and through lines of smiling young women to reach the newest outpost in President Trump’s international business empire. At the Saturday night opening of the clubhouse of the Trump International Golf Club, Dubai, guests munched on mini chicken burgers and sipped fizzy lemonade while Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr. the president’s adult sons, lauded the ruler of Dubai and their business partner, Hussain Sajwani. Mr. Sajwani, a billionaire businessman who, like Mr. Trump, built his wealth through real estate, told the crowd that working with the Trumps “was and continues to be a pleasure. ” On the other side of the world, in Vancouver, British Columbia, preparations continued for another   on Feb. 28, at a new Trump hotel and condo project there, funded by the Malaysian tycoon Tiah Thee Kian and his son, Tiah Joo Kim. The two projects, the first to open since Mr. Trump became president, are among the dozen international business deals from his former life still moving forward  —   from India to Indonesia, Uruguay to the Dominican Republic. None of them are “new deals,” as defined by the family, as they were already well underway before the election. Mr. Sajwani and Mr. Tiah share traits common among Mr. Trump’s partners around the world, including in Indonesia and the Philippines. They are brash, wealthy developers whose families have personal ties to Mr. Trump or to his children. But the projects in which the two men are involved highlight the complications created when the president of the United States also owns a global real estate company. Condominium units in the Vancouver building, the Trump International Hotel  Tower, have been purchased by affluent buyers, including a family that runs a Hong Kong machinery company   by a Chinese   enterprise, according to real estate and corporate records. The Trump Organization is managing only the hotel, in exchange for a fee. And Mr. Sajwani has contracted extensively with the United States military and spoken of entering the American real estate market  —   moves that could be easier with a friend in the White House. Eric Trump, who with his older brother helps run the Trump Organization now that their father is president, said before the Dubai event that the company was not the owner of either development, but only collected a small share of the revenues, and that it did not control who bought the units in Vancouver or the membership list at the golf course in Dubai. Addressing the guests on Saturday, Eric Trump praised his family’s partnership with Mr. Sajwani. “It is not every day that you have a partner that is also a great friend,” he said. “Hussain, thank you so much for your love, your friendship. ” Donald Trump Jr. praised Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid   the ruler of Dubai, saying it was his vision for the country that allowed such projects to succeed. “It’s a great example of what can be built here and what will continue to be built in the years to come,” he said. But actions by the elder Mr. Trump, since he began his presidential campaign and now that he is in the White House, have repercussions for his projects. Some in the Emirates worry about Mr. Trump’s stance toward Muslims. And Vancouver’s mayor called in December 2015 for the Trump name to be removed from the property there, given Mr. Trump’s statements about instituting a “total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States. ” “Donald Trump’s hateful positions and commentary remind us all of much darker times in our world’s past  —   and it is incumbent upon all of us to forcefully challenge hatred in all of the ways that it confronts us,” Mayor Gregor Robertson wrote in a letter to the developer, citing thousands who had signed a petition to have Mr. Trump’s name removed. “It is their belief, and my belief, that Trump’s name and brand have no more place on Vancouver’s skyline than his ignorant ideas have in the modern world. ” A few years ago, Mr. Trump, then a real estate tycoon, visited what would turn out to be his first project to open after he became president and his first in the Arab world. The Trump International Golf Club Dubai was to form the centerpiece of a luxurious collection of upscale homes, and Mr. Trump wanted to check the details. “We walked through the golf course and he said: ‘You see that tree move it 10 feet there. That tree is too small make it bigger,’” recalled Niall McLoughlin, a senior vice president at Damac Properties, which owns the project. “His attention to detail is tremendous. ” The Trump Organization had been brought in to operate the golf course by Damac, whose chairman, Mr. Sajwani, had known Mr. Trump for years. Like Mr. Trump, Mr. Sajwani rose to billionaire status largely through flashy real estate projects. The son of a shopkeeper, he graduated from the University of Washington, then returned to the United Arab Emirates to found a catering company that provided meals to businesses. He soon found a bigger client: the United States government. During the first Persian Gulf war, in 1991, his company provided meals to American soldiers, and it has held similar contracts elsewhere in the Persian Gulf and in Somalia and Bosnia since then. But his wealth really took off when he focused on real estate in the early 2000s, as an economic boom in Dubai created a growing class of professionals looking for fancy homes. Mr. Sajwani has made his name with splashy promotions, sometimes offering free cars, including Mini Coopers and Lamborghinis, to home buyers. Last year, Forbes called him “The Donald of Dubai,” putting his net worth at $3. 2 billion. Mr. Sajwani now has projects around the Arab world and has expressed interest in investing in the United States. He has also maintained his relationship with Mr. Trump. Dressed in a traditional Emirati robe, Mr. Sajwani appeared at the opening of the Trump International Hotel in Washington in October, weeks before Mr. Trump was elected. And at his first news conference as   Mr. Trump said he had turned down an offer from Damac for a new $2 billion deal in Dubai. Questions swirled about the commitment of Mr. Sajwani, a Muslim in a predominately Muslim country, to the Trump brand in 2015, after Mr. Trump said that if elected, he would impose a ban on Muslims entering the United States. A few days later, billboards near the course in Dubai showing Mr. Trump swinging a golf club and his daughter Ivanka holding a handbag were temporarily taken down, as was Mr. Trump’s name, spelled out in gold letters on a wall near the entrance. Mr. McLoughlin, of Damac, said in an interview in November that the changes had been routine and unrelated to Mr. Trump’s statements. “It was a purely unfortunate coincidence,” he said. “We are an apolitical organization. ” There was no overt mention of Mr. Trump at the clubhouse opening on Saturday, but his name was omnipresent, on flags flying around the golf course and on hats, shirts, visors and balls for sale in the pro shop. No alcohol was served at the opening, though it will be available at the clubhouse. Mr. Trump’s companies, according to a financial disclosure report, were paid $1 million to $5 million for the Dubai golf course project last year, with another $1 million to $5 million coming from a second Dubai golf course still being built, also in partnership with Mr. Sajwani. Members will pay $36, 000 a year, plus a $10, 000   fee, said Mr. McLoughlin, who declined to say how many people had joined so far or who they were. But he suggested that the election had elevated Mr. Trump’s name. “His brand was a global brand, and now it’s an even bigger global brand,” he said. Later this month, Mr. Trump’s sons are scheduled to preside over another grand opening, this time of the Trump International Hotel  Tower Vancouver, which was developed by the Holborn Group, run by Tiah Joo Kim, 37. Mr. Tiah formed the partnership with the Trump family and spearheaded the development of the residence and hotel, his first major project, by making a pitch first to Donald Jr. Eric and Ivanka. Their father eventually signed off on the deal. Mr. Tiah’s father, Tiah Thee Kian, made his fortune in the Malaysian stock market in the 1980s. But in the late 1990s, he was accused of violating securities law and eventually paid a fine of about $900, 000. At the time, he was said to be a supporter of Anwar Ibrahim, then the deputy prime minister, who had challenged the leadership of Mahathir Mohamad, the prime minister. Mr. Anwar was later imprisoned on sodomy charges, a case widely seen as politically motivated. In a country that runs on political patronage, one where many decisions are made behind the scenes, the elder Mr. Tiah’s political alliance with Mr. Anwar may have contributed to his legal setbacks. Political analysts and insiders say he has not been involved in politics since that time and has kept a low profile. The company’s most profitable venture now is the Trump development in Vancouver, the younger Mr. Tiah said, adding that he assiduously avoided any political entanglements. When he reached an agreement with Mr. Trump in 2012, he never foresaw that Mr. Trump would have a political career. The Vancouver project includes 217 residential units. All were sold before the election except for the three penthouses, which have not been put on the market. No buyer has sought to back out, Mr. Tiah said. Two units belong to the Fong family, which paid more than $4. 2 million for them. Public records link the units to Sou Lam Fong, founder of CHTC Fong’s Industries Company Ltd. a   machinery company based in Hong Kong. The company is   by a Chinese   enterprise, China   Group Corporation, according to a recent annual report. “The Trump name represents quality,” said Bill Streeper, the mayor of the Northern Rockies municipality in British Columbia and a major real estate developer, who bought a unit in the tower on the 55th floor in 2013, long before Mr. Trump won the Republican nomination. Mr. Trump’s election victory has brought a great deal of attention, good and bad, to the hotel, the younger Mr. Tiah said. There have been a number of   protests, but the hotel has also received plenty of free publicity. On a recent visit to the hotel’s champagne bar, Brittany Dacosta, 26, was having a drink with her sister. She said it was her second time at Trump Vancouver in the past week. “This place is very controversial, so it kind of made us want to come here more,” she said. “I know it sounds bad, but Trump is glamorous. ” Mr. Tiah said he tried to steer a middle course and encourage tolerance. “The American people have chosen,” he said, “so let’s respect their decision and give him a chance. ”	1
90	WASHINGTON  —   Despite sharp differences on immigration, refugees, trade and climate change, President Trump and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada struck a cordial tone on Monday in their first meeting, alternating between attempting to bridge those gaps and steering clear of them. Mr. Trump has called for a halt to the admission of refugees, saying that terrorists might slip into the United States among them, while Mr. Trudeau has held out Canada as a haven for refugees, particularly people who have fled the war in Syria, publicly hugging newly arrived families. When asked at a White House news conference whether he now sees the northern American border with Canada as insecure, Mr. Trump skirted the question, speaking instead of his administration’s efforts to deport criminals from the United States. In the same vein, Mr. Trudeau declined to say whether he agreed with the president’s executive order restricting immigration. “The last thing Canadians expect is for me to come down and lecture another country on how they choose to govern themselves,” he said. Maintaining the country’s close political and economic links with the United States was top of the Canadian leader’s agenda before his visit to Washington. Mr. Trudeau had forged an unusually close relationship with former President Barack Obama, but many of Mr. Trump’s policies, particularly his protectionist stance on trade and his call for renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement, are chilling for Canadians. They count on trade with the United States for about 25 percent of their country’s gross domestic product. “It is a real concern for many Canadians because we know that our economy is very dependent on our bonds with the United States,” said Mr. Trudeau, who has expressed a cautious openness to renegotiating the trade pact. Mr. Trump’s complaints about trade have focused primarily on Mexico, another partner in the North American agreement, and China, which he has accused of taking advantage of the United States. He did not answer a question about whether he sees Canada as a fair trader, but suggested that he does not foresee deep changes in that relationship, which he called “outstanding. ” “We’ll be tweaking it,” he said. “It’s a much less severe situation than what’s taking place on the southern border. ” He said the two leaders had spoken privately about “doing some   things that will make it a lot easier for trade and a lot better and a lot faster. ” They issued a joint statement pledging to continue border security programs that began under Mr. Obama, and reaffirming their commitment to NATO, an alliance that Mr. Trump had previously questioned. In presentation and speech, Mr. Trump, a bombastic Republican, and Mr. Trudeau, a more   Liberal who is 25 years younger, are poles apart. But the prime minister has carefully avoided direct criticism of Mr. Trump and his policies. After the American election, he reorganized his cabinet to better deal with the change of power in Washington and swiftly sent emissaries to meet with Mr. Trump’s advisers. The meeting was the first test of the Canadian leader’s effort to foster a good working relationship. Mr. Trump greeted Mr. Trudeau warmly, a reception similar to the president’s greeting last week to Shinzo Abe, Japan’s prime minister. The leaders shook hands heartily when Mr. Trudeau arrived at the White House, patting each other on the shoulder with their free hands. Mr. Trudeau appears determined to maintain friendly relations with Mr. Trump despite their differences, while signaling to Canadians who are wary of their powerful neighbor that Canada still charts its own course. “We continue our policy of openness to immigration and refugees without compromising security,” the prime minister said. “There have been times where we have differed in our approaches, and that’s always been done firmly and respectfully. ” Mr. Trudeau presented the president with a framed photograph taken in the 1980s, showing Mr. Trump speaking at the head of a table of people including Pierre Elliott Trudeau, a former Liberal prime minister of Canada and the current prime minister’s father. The cabinet ministers who traveled with Mr. Trudeau on Monday had prepared for meetings with their American counterparts by emphasizing the importance of the   relationship to Canadians. Chrystia Freeland, Canada’s foreign minister, had reminded Trump administration officials that trade between the countries is roughly in balance, and that Canada is the largest buyer of American exports from 35 states. “The combination of Canada being smaller and the United States being bigger and the relationship largely being   means a lot of Americans don’t spend a lot of time thinking about Canada,” Ms. Freeland said in a recent interview. “Americans are not always fully aware of the economic significance of the relationship. ” Canadian business leaders expressed some relief after their prime minister’s meeting with Mr. Trump. “On the whole, this was a good day,” said John Manley, the president and chief executive of the Business Council of Canada, which represents 150 large Canadian corporations. “There’s still lots of things to be anxious about, but I think the tone and the substance were all very positive. ” Some of those anxieties stem from uncertainty over what small changes to the United   trade relationship could mean for some sectors of the economy. There had been concerns after Mr. Trump’s election that he might go after the Canadian auto industry, a major employer in Ontario, which exports most of its production to the United States. Flavio Volpe, the president of the Auto Parts Manufacturers’ Association, a trade group, said that it was important for his members to hear Mr. Trump’s message that he is not planning to dramatically remake the United States’ trade relationship to Canada. The two leaders also met on Monday with several women who are chief executives of companies from both countries to announce that Canada and the United States would set up a   council to advance women into executive roles, and to encourage entrepreneurship.	1
875	 Gabrielle Samuels was listening to iTunes on her iPhone 6 Plus last night while attempting to fall asleep. The 19-year-old did nothing more than what she does every night before going to bed. She had just graduated high school and was enjoying her summer break before attending college in the fall. Sadly, this night was the last night that Samuels would enjoy her bedtime playlist.[Her friend Hassan Gates’] gruesome discovery would forever change him and the Samuels family. Gates was given a key to the Samuels residence prior to this incident incase of emergencies. Gates used the key to enter the home where he noticed a ‘burnt’ smell. “I thought I smelled burnt bacon so I checked the kitchen first. I just saw a box of cereal on the table and two half-filled cups of coffee. Since I didn’t see any food cooked, I decided to go upstairs and surprise my bae. The burnt smell got stronger as I got upstairs. When I opened the door to Gabby’s room, it smelled like someone had been barbecuing, that’s when I found Gabby in the bed. I immediately ran over to her to see if she was okay but she was unresponsive so I called 911” said Gates.	0

524	 Southern Regional Police busted an Amish Dobergoat fighting ring this morning just south of Quarryville.The bust which happened at 3am resulted in the arrest of 12 Amish men and the confiscation of more than 30 dobergoats.“I never seen nothing like it. There was dead and injured Dobergoats everywhere.” said SRPD officer Matt Nevins.Dobergoats are the result of crossbreeding a Boer Goat and a Doberman Pinscher. Originally bred by the Amish to protect cattle and sheep, Dobergoat fighting was popularized by Lancaster Amish in the 1980’s. After much deliberation at the People of Lancaster News Room it has been decided that People of Lancaster will no longer be referring to itself as a “Satire” website and instead classify itself as a “News” website. What has lead to the change is that “News” websites have historically enjoyed a more distinguished presence on the internet with greater following and thus more advertising dollars.When asked for comment, head writer and lighthouse keeper Abner Hockenfoos released the following statement which was delivered via courier Doberman:“We have decided to make this dramatic change in light of the fact that a large percentage of our readers believe everything we publish is true. With Snopes investigating most of our articles on a daily basis we decided why fight it. Only 8% of Fox News information is verifiably true, we can easily beat that. There is a Lancaster, we have Amish, and we do make stuff up. This alone accounts for at least 10% of our content.” People of Lancaster is a mix of news, opinion, and satire about the people, places and interests of Lancaster County, PA.Much of the content on this site is satire inspired by real people or events that we love to coat with a heavy layer of snark and sarcasm.How can you tell what is real and what is satire?Well, if ‘obvious’ escapes you and you lack the intellectual curiosity to discover the truth for yourself you can view the tags assigned to every story published on the website.

342	OXON HILL, Md.  —   Stephen K. Bannon brought the battle plan. President Trump brought the fight. A day after his secretive chief strategist laid out a   new definition of conservatism animated by attacks on “the administrative state,” globalism and the “corporatist media,” Mr. Trump delivered a visceral gut punch of a speech that executed almost all of the tactics that define the   philosophy of the   West Wing. Speaking to the Conservative Political Action Conference on Friday, Mr. Trump launched what was easily the most blistering attack on the media and corporate elites of his already bellicose and eventful presidency. His speech also included a promise to throw undocumented immigrants “the hell out of the country” and a recitation of his    campaign promises. It represented a   friendly takeover of CPAC, an establishment Republican group whose leadership once viewed the party’s surprise   as a noisy interloper. Mr. Bannon, the former Breitbart chief executive who has a hand in nearly every scripted public Trump utterance, had expressed a similar sentiment at the conference the day before. “If you think they’re going to give you your country back without a fight, you are sadly mistaken,” he said during an appearance with Reince Priebus, the White House chief of staff. “Every day, it is going to be a fight. ” His onstage discussion, it turned out, was a   preview of Mr. Trump’s populist broadsides, with an admonition to anyone who continues to underestimate the determination of the Trump White House to disrupt the Washington establishment. Mr. Trump’s less restrained approach energized CPAC attendees who had once viewed the     as a   celebrity curiosity  —   they serenaded him with chants of “Trump” and “U. S. A. ” And his message is resonating with Republican voters, over 80 percent of whom approve of his job performance, despite historically low levels of support among all voters. But Mr. Trump is intensifying his assault on his enemies on the eve of his first national address before a joint session of Congress, a time when most new presidents are moving in the opposite direction, pivoting from martial campaign rhetoric to the more positive, inclusive language of governance needed to build the coalition necessary to pass major legislation. On an operational level, Mr. Trump’s inexperienced but confident White House staff members  —   dominated by Mr. Bannon  —   are leaning on Hill Republicans to draft tax overhaul measures and a replacement bill for the Affordable Care Act. In the meantime, they have focused on enacting a series of   executive orders, an approach often adopted by presidents at the end of their terms when their legislative leverage has been exhausted. As they did during the campaign, Mr. Trump and Mr. Bannon believe they are tapping into an American public less interested in the standard optimistic tropes of presidential politics and more interested in someone who speaks truth to their anxieties. Moreover, aides to Mr. Trump say he fares best when he’s able to target  —   and nickname  —   an opponent, whether it is “Little Marco” Rubio, “Crooked Hillary” Clinton or the “Fake News” media. Mr. Bannon, bookish and prone to surrounding himself with   young acolytes, previewed Mr. Trump’s   during the Thursday session. “They’re corporatist, globalist media that are adamantly opposed  —   adamantly opposed to an economic nationalist agenda like Donald Trump has,” he said. “I think if you look at the opposition party and how they portray the campaign, how they portrayed the transition and now they’re portraying the administration, it’s always wrong. ” The attacks on the news media come at a time when the press has been reporting on the Trump campaign’s apparent connections to Russia, the botched rollout of Mr. Trump’s executive order on immigration and the forced resignation of Michael T. Flynn, the national security adviser, after less than a month on the job. “They’re very smart, they’re very cunning and they’re very dishonest,” Mr. Trump said on a day when his press secretary scrapped his daily briefing for an     gaggle for selected reporters. The move, people familiar with the situation said, was enthusiastically backed by Mr. Bannon. The symbiotic political and personal relationship between the two men  —   the rumpled   and the compulsively public and   president  —   is driving much of the momentum and dysfunction of the White House, aides say. For all his talk of creating a blueprint for a Trumpian conservatism that outlasts the president’s career, Mr. Bannon is not regarded as a   manager, and he let slip during his CPAC appearance that things in the White House have gone well  —   but only “to the degree we were planning” them. There is not a lot of daylight between Mr. Trump and Mr. Bannon on the issues, although the president often jokes that Mr. Bannon’s economic populist agenda makes it hard to tell if the former Naval officer and Goldman Sachs executive is “  or ” according to a Trump associate friendly with both. The biggest difference between the president and his chief strategist is that Mr. Trump is far less constrained by the dictates of any single philosophy  —   even Mr. Bannon’s vision of Trumpism  —   than Mr. Bannon, who sees history as a succession of movements and power struggles. And while Mr. Bannon described the president as “maniacally focused” on fulfilling his campaign promises, Mr. Trump often loses focus, as he did during numerous digressions from his scripted remarks on Friday. He unleashed the latest in a succession of surprise rhetorical attacks on longstanding American allies, extemporizing about a friend named Jim who had told him to avoid the “City of Lights” because after several terrorist attacks, “Paris is no longer Paris. ” Clearly reveling in the adulation of a room that had once been hard to win, the president alternated between a theme of dark days  —   once again singling out violence on the streets of Chicago  —   and light comedy. Speaking of a meeting with business leaders this week that included food producers, he quipped, “I like Campbell’s soup. ” He also joked about his first appearance at this annual conservative conclave. “If you remember, it was my first major speech. They said he didn’t get a standing ovation  —   because everybody stood,” Mr. Trump said of the speech, in 2011. “I had very little notes and even less preparation,” he said. “And then you leave, and everybody is thrilled, and I say, ‘I like this business. ’”	1

458	(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the  .) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. Reaction to President Trump’s address tended to focus on its sober style. His seriousness of purpose and calls for unity reassured  —   and surprised  —   many listeners. “I think it sounded great, like a utopia,” one voter said, adding, “I don’t think it’s that simple. ” Indeed, Mr. Trump, who met with congressional Republican leaders on Wednesday, faces not only a committed Democratic opposition but a divided Republican Party. Today’s episode of The Daily podcast examines the president’s speech to Congress, his call for unity and his promise to protect America. Listen from a computer, on an iOS device or on an Android device. _____ 2. Emboldened by encouraging signals from the Trump administration, populist leaders across Central and Eastern Europe are cracking on nongovernmental organizations once protected by Washington. Groups that promote open government, aid refugees and often serve as checks on authoritarian governments are being targeted. Organizations funded by George Soros, the liberal American billionaire, are facing particular ire, accused of working to flood Europe with Muslim refugees and transform “Christian” nations into multicultural stews of   globalism. _____ 3. Developments in Syria this week: Russia mistakenly bombed Syrian fighters being trained by the U. S. another unintended clash among the myriad forces operating on the battlefield. And U. N. investigators released a report detailing war crimes, calling the Syrian government’s bombing of a humanitarian convoy in September, which killed 14 aid workers, “one of the most egregious. ” Next door in Iraq, the battle for Mosul continues. Our reporter met a family fleeing the   portion of the city. _____ 4. Tornadoes lashed the Midwest, killing at least three people and leaving a trail of splintered homes, razed businesses and power outages. The severe weather isn’t over yet. Forecasters said the   and Deep South were also at risk. _____ 5. Snap Inc. is losing money, but its valuation was set at $24 billion on the eve of its arrival on the New York Stock Exchange, one of the biggest market debuts in years. Shares of the Snapchat parent company were priced at $17, higher than expected in an indication of strong demand. _____ 6. Scientists may have found the oldest signs of life on Earth. Or not. Some researchers say ancient rocks in a remote geological outpost in Canada yielded bacteria fossils that could be up to 4. 2 billion years old, relatively soon after the planet’s birth. Others are dubious  —   and vocal. Such battles, an optimist observed, are “how science progresses. ” _____ 7. In a sign that the era of the starchitect may be over, a modest team of three architects won their profession’s highest honor: the Pritzker Prize. Rafael Aranda, Carme Pigem and Ramon Vilalta set up shop in their hometown in Spain 30 years ago and are not   outside the country. Their major works include the Soulages Museum, in Rodez, France, and the Sant Antoni  —   Joan Oliver Library in Barcelona. The award cited “their intensely collaborative way of working together, where the creative process, commitment to vision and all responsibilities are shared equally. ” _____ 8. Los Angeles votes for mayor next Tuesday. The incumbent, Eric Garcetti, a Democrat, faces some criticism for being “bureaucratic bland” but seems assured of beating 10 challengers for a second term  —   and possibly a bigger role in an embattled national party. We caught up with him at an outdoor cafe downtown, where he sipped green tea, fielded requests for money from a homeless man, and said: “I think people mistake bloody noses for big accomplishments. Maybe because I don’t draw blood, but we actually work well with people, that that is seen as cautious. ” _____ 9. Our tech writer says the sexism scandal at Uber feels like a watershed moment for Silicon Valley. “This could be the start of a deep,   and thorough effort to remake a culture that has long sidelined women  —   not just at Uber but across the tech business, too,” he writes. _____ 10. Spring is almost here. Here’s a guide to the season’s most promising live events, from Bette Midler’s star turn in “Hello, Dolly!” to Chris Rock’s first standup tour in nearly a decade to The Weeknd’s new North American jaunt. And don’t forget “Groundhog Day,” a new musical based on the hit film, coming to Broadway this spring after a London run. Above, Punxsutawney Phil, aka Raymond J. Lee, in transit. _____ 11. Finally, we’ve been surfing the web for you. And we found lots of great stories that have nothing to do with politics. For instance, Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s fitness routine,  ’s special scent, the world’s worst skier and a trip to infinity. Have a great night. _____ Photographs may appear out of order for some readers.

462	Millennials, those 14 to 35 years old, may be as exuberantly hyped a demographic as any in recent memory. That generation has now helped power one of the biggest and most eagerly awaited stock market debuts in recent memory, making billionaires of the founders of the   service Snapchat. Investors, attracted by Snapchat’s hold on its millennial users  —   who check the app on average more than 18 times a day  —   flocked to the initial public offering, pushing the parent company, Snap Inc. to a valuation of nearly $24 billion. The stock sale sets Snap up as the most valuable American technology company to go public since Facebook nearly five years ago. And it may herald a coming wave of unicorns  —   technology   valued at more than $1 billion by private investors  —   that are expected to hit the public markets in the next few years. Snap’s offering was priced on Wednesday at $17 a share  —   a dollar more than the previously expected pricing range. The pricing came on a day when the stock market surged to another high, fed by raised expectations of tax cuts, looser regulations and higher interest rates under the Trump administration. Shares of the social media companies Facebook and Twitter also rose. Those buying into Snap’s offering did so even as warning signs have flashed over the company, based in California. It lost more than $500 million last year, and its explosive user growth appears to have hit a speed bump. And in a decision that has angered some large investors, the shares will have no voting rights, leaving control in the hands of the company’s founders, who can retain that power for years even after leaving Snap. Yet when Snap begins trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday, under the ticker name SNAP, it will command a lofty valuation multiple even richer than that of Facebook, which earned $10 billion last year. The question beyond this week is whether Snap will prove to be like mighty Facebook or embattled Twitter. Much has been riding on Snap’s offering, including expectations that it will lift a moribund market in new stocks. In going public, Snap has leapt ahead of other technology darlings like Uber, Airbnb and the   provider Palantir. After a nearly   road show for investors that spanned the country and stretched to London, demand for Snap shares proved robust. Bankers for the company received orders totaling more than 10 times the number of shares up for sale. With a market value of almost $24 billion, including unvested stock options and grants, the company is now setting itself up with little room for error. Throughout the presentations to investors, Snap executives and their advisers kept the emphasis squarely on the promise of what first seemed like a technological lark. Instead of focusing on the core product of disappearing messages, Snapchat instead represents a new way of consuming content, largely produced by its users  —   laid alongside a   advertising business. At the end of 2016, Snap reported an average of 158 million active daily users. Revenue totaled about $404 million for the year, up from zero in sales three years ago. The company believes sales could reach $1 billion this year. Those sales have come primarily from advertisers who covet both millennial users and a service that has figured out creative ways to reach them.   brands from Gatorade to Tiffany have run campaigns on the social network, and the advertising titan WPP said at an industry conference on Wednesday that it spent $90 million on Snapchat ads last year. Snap has come a long way from its beginnings in a Stanford dorm room as a service used largely by young people enamored with sending their friends pictures and video that   after seconds. Based in the fashionable Los Angeles neighborhood of Venice, the company has since introduced ways for users to broadcast “stories” about their days to wider audiences and pioneered the use of   lenses that transform those users into dogs or Taco Bell tacos. Now, Snap is trying to convey even greater ambitions. In the prospectus for its stock sale, the service declared itself a “camera company. ” So far that has included selling Spectacles,   sunglasses that let users upload   videos directly to Snapchat, which briefly captured the fancy of the tech cognoscenti. And Snap has worked on prototypes for products like   cameras. Evan Spiegel, 26, a Snap founder and its chief executive, has played down comparisons to the Facebook billionaire Mark Zuckerberg and has assiduously painted an image of himself  —   a fashion aficionado with a supermodel fiancée  —   that is different from Mr. Zuckerberg. But Mr. Spiegel and his fellow shareholders are still hoping that investors will help lift their company to   heights. Since Mr. Zuckerberg took his business public just under five years ago, Facebook’s shares have climbed more than 254 percent. The cautionary tale is that of Twitter, which celebrated a lofty stock market debut in 2013, only to have its share price tumble amid questions about its ability to grow. Twitter’s stock is down about 62 percent from its initial public offering, and the company has had to fend off questions about whether it can remain an independent and publicly traded business. Analysts also raised the specter of lower growth with Snap, given that the company’s user growth slowed last year. Then there is the copycatting of Snapchat’s most recognizable features, from its Stories to its animated lenses and filters. Chief among the imitators is Facebook, whose Instagram service has forthrightly adopted those elements. Even smaller social networks like Medium, a   service, have rolled out similar offerings. Executives contended during the investor presentations that Snapchat’s slowdown was largely due to technical issues with its Android app. And they argued that the bigger issue to look at was engagement, or, put another way, how much its audience loves the app. And Snap, under Mr. Spiegel, has argued that it will continue to roll out innovations. Regardless of whether Snap soars or sinks, its offering will significantly enrich its earliest investors, notably Mr. Spiegel and the company’s other founder, Robert Murphy. With 227 million shares each, the two men are each worth more than $3 billion on paper, well ahead of their 30th birthdays.	1

497	WASHINGTON  —   Melania Trump made her first solo foray in public as first lady on Thursday, visiting a hospital pediatric wing to read to sick children. Mrs. Trump, who has been reluctant to embrace the   and   role of presidential spouse, began with a brief and simple outing: an afternoon reading of a Dr. Seuss book in honor of the author’s birthday and National Read Across America Day. “So you know what is today?” she asked the children, who wore hospital gowns and gathered in a playroom in the pediatric wing of     Cornell Medical Center in Manhattan to see Mrs. Trump. “It’s a reading day. So I came to encourage you to read, and to think about what you want to achieve in life. ” Mrs. Trump, whose aides had arranged for a small pool of reporters and photographers to cover the visit, then proceeded to read “Oh, the Places You’ll Go! ,” a Dr. Seuss classic with an inspirational message that she said was a favorite of hers. “You’ll be as famous as famous can be,” Mrs. Trump read from the book. “With the whole wide world watching you win on TV. ” Mrs. Trump has stayed mostly out of the spotlight since President Trump took office. She has appeared at her husband’s side for a handful of official events, most recently accompanying him to the Capitol on Tuesday for his address to a joint session of Congress. But she has avoided the press and done nothing in public to carve out her own priorities or initiatives as first lady. Michelle Obama made outings with young people a staple of her time as first lady, often making unscheduled stops to spend time with them. On Tuesday, the former first lady was back at it, surprising students in a vocational program at a Washington public school, where she spent more than an hour discussing the importance of pursuing higher education. Mrs. Obama posted a photograph of her visit on Twitter. A photograph of Mrs. Trump’s hospital story time appeared in her Twitter feed on Thursday. Mrs. Trump has said she is interested in working to combat cyberbullying, but has yet to start such a program. And while she has named a chief of staff and a social secretary, the White House has not announced the hiring of other key players in the East Wing, such as a communications director, a press secretary or other senior staff members. Mrs. Trump has made it known she does not intend to be much of a presence in Washington at least in the short term she has opted to reside in New York while the couple’s    son, Barron, finishes his school year. On Thursday, she donned large black sunglasses and stepped into a car that was part of a small motorcade waiting outside Trump Tower to take her to the hospital about a mile and a half away. “I hope you’re all feeling well,” Mrs. Trump told the assembled children. After she finished reading the book, Mrs. Trump gave it to a young girl who had been listening, saying, “I encourage you all to read a lot  —   to get educated. ”	1
301	Just over 10 years ago, United States Border Patrol agents were startled by an unexpected new development in their   battle to stop illegal immigration: Brazilians. In 2005 thousands of them started streaming across the southwestern border. More than 31, 000 were apprehended by the Border Patrol trying to make their way into the United States, a number surpassed only by Mexicans, Salvadorans and Hondurans. And then, just as abruptly, the flow stopped. Under pressure from Washington, Mexico reimposed a tourist visa requirement on Brazil that it had eliminated five years before. This severed a trafficking route that started with an easy flight from Rio de Janeiro to Cancún and ended in a trek across the desert into southern Texas. In 2006, apprehensions of Brazilians by the Border Patrol fell 95 percent, to 1, 460. Today few even try to sneak through. Over the last three years it has been mostly Guatemalans, Hondurans and Salvadorans who are fleeing home by the tens of thousands, hoping to cross Mexico to reach the United States. But as in 2005, the main buffer the United States has to stop Central American immigrants from entering illegally across the border  —   its wall, as it were  —   is Mexico. Mexico is a tool that the Trump administration now stands to lose. Ever since the skirmishing of the first few days of Donald J. Trump’s presidency, when President Enrique Peña Nieto of Mexico canceled a visit to the United States after Mr. Trump repeated that Mexico would pay for his promised border wall, Mexican officials have hoped that more serene heads in the administration might moderate some of Mr. Trump’s more hostile proposals. Mexico’s development strategy over the last three decades has been all about tying its economy with that of the United States. The North American Free Trade Agreement was supposed to be its growth engine, drawing investment by multinational companies to serve the enormous American market. Immigration north served as its pressure valve  —   allowing it to weather repeated financial crises by allowing the American job market to absorb idle Mexican workers. Not incidentally, that also contributes to United States economic growth. As I noted in a column last month, with President Trump promising to turn his back on the United States’ southern neighbor  —   renegotiating Nafta on presumably worse terms for Mexico and walling off the southwestern border  —   Mexican officials are desperately trying to convince his administration that the United States needs Mexico, too. Their hopes, however, are likely to be dashed. This week, Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson and his Homeland Security counterpart, John F. Kelly, are visiting Mexico to assess what sort of bilateral cooperation might be possible in this new era. Even before they got on the plane, new rules suggest that the hard line will prevail. Two memos signed by Mr. Kelly  —   guidelines for Mr. Trump’s promised immigration crackdown  —   call for aggressively seeking out, detaining and deporting immigrants living without authorization in the United States. They order the hiring of 10, 000 immigration enforcement agents and 5, 000 Border Patrol officers, and direct Customs and Border Protection to start designing and building the wall. And in a move sure to stir Mexican outrage, the guidelines direct immigration officials to return immigrants from any country caught entering illegally to “the territory of the foreign contiguous country from which they arrived” while they await removal proceedings in the United States. And that means Mexico. Officials at the Department of Homeland Security argued that returning Central Americans to Mexico would be done only in a limited fashion, and only after discussions with the government of Mexico. Somehow, it seems unlikely that a provision designed to reduce costs for the American government by foisting them onto Mexico will go down well in Mexico City. “That would violate every agreement and convention,” said Gustavo Mohar, who formerly served as Mexico’s top negotiator for immigration with the United States, about the provision. “Mexico is obliged to receive Mexicans, but it has the right to demand accreditation that they are indeed Mexican,” Mr. Mohar said. What might Mexico do in return? Refuse to take people who can’t prove Mexican citizenship? As a former foreign minister, Jorge Castañeda, told me, one option might be to get out of the way and let Central Americans cross Mexico unimpeded to the United States. Here’s what is at stake. Last year, Mexico returned 143, 057 Central American migrants to their countries of origin. It sent home more than 59, 000 Guatemalan migrants moving north across its territory, and repatriated nearly 48, 000 Hondurans and 31, 000 Salvadorans, according to the International Organization for Migration. Over all, Mexico stopped and sent back almost twice as many Central Americans as the United States did. The question is, Could President Trump’s wall replace this buffer? History suggests the most productive policy would aim to manage immigration from poorer countries to ensure it remains legal. Trying to stop it simply pushes it underground. An immigrant   program managed by Mexico and the United States, some experts suggest, could help migrants, protect American workers and fulfill the needs of American employers. But even if such enlightened policy is still politically out of reach, the argument for cooperation between Mexico and the United States remains powerful. These days, illegal migration from Mexico is a relatively minor problem. Apprehensions of Mexican immigrants at the border are running at their lowest since the 1970s. Fewer Mexicans are coming north across the border than are returning home from the United States. Last year, more Central Americans than Mexicans were apprehended by the Border Patrol. Mexico is now mainly a passageway. Past American governments have recognized the importance of Mexico’s help. Washington  has given Mexico $24 million to support immigration enforcement  —   mostly in training and   gadgetry  —   and obligated $75 million more. Of course, Mexico doesn’t do this only out of love for its northern neighbor. As Mr. Mohar points out, even if their final destination is the United States, tens of thousands of Central Americans marching northward can put stress on Mexican communities, too. Notably, if Mexican officials were to just wave them through, they would place enormous strains on cities along Mexico’s northern border. And yet the new American administration might recognize that preventing Central Americans from reaching the United States imposes a high political cost on the Mexican government. In 2014, when Mr. Peña Nieto announced the Southern Border Plan to tighten security around border points of entry and known migration corridors, he was harshly criticized for doing dirty work for the United States. “It became a news story in Mexico: Why are we treating Central American migrants like the United States treats Mexicans?” said Andrew Selee, executive vice president of the Wilson Center in Washington, a research center focused on international affairs. “The Mexican government persisted because it perceived that a migration crisis on the border with the United States could also damage Mexico,” he noted. “There were other things at stake in the relationship that it didn’t want to risk. ” By threatening to build a wall and leave Nafta and do any number of things to Mexico, Mr. Trump is changing this equation. If hostility is all he has to offer, the political cost for Mexico to be America’s wall may prove too steep.	1
592	 Sunny Oaks Elementary School in California is making headlines this week for the absurd thing they are having their students participate in.The staff is under question by parents and media after a student came home complaining to her parents that she had to dress up in boys clothes over her dress that she wore to school.Parents of the girl said to Fox News, “It is bad enough that our society is now forcing us to allow transgenders into the wrong bathrooms, but for our school system to teach our kids that this is normal is absolutely wrong.”Although the superintendent did not know of the transgender desensitization event at school he did say that he had approved of LGBT week for students to learn about the prejudice of society against this group of people.All events for the week have been cancelled after making media headlines.	0
690	 With millions of dollars saved by free media coverage, it allows Donald Trump to spend money differently than a traditional politician. He recently paid Sarah Palin $10 million for her endorsement to help gain Evangelical support.The strategy behind the deal was to help court the Evangelical vote away from Ted Cruz in Iowa. Strategist Dale Roberts told the Des Moines Register, “This was a smart move, cheaper than buying TV ads, and most likely more effective. When going after the uneducated, you always bring in one of their own, someone they can relate to.”	0
918	 A dairy farmer from a small town near the Great Salt Lake in Utah, made an incredible discovery on his property while he was looking for one of his cows that had not returned. 69-year old Michael Woodson, found a 12 meter long humpback whale laying lifeless in the middle of one of his fields, hundreds of kilometers away its natural habitat.The Farmington City Police was called on the site to investigate, since the farmer thought that the cetacean could have been left there as a creepy prank by some neighborhood youngsters. The investigators rapidly dismissed the possibility however, as no traces of vehicles or machinery large enough to carry it were found anywhere near the animal. The police admits that they are almost clueless at the moment as to how the marine mammal found its way on Mr. Woodson’s property.“We are verifying every clue and information that we have, and I assure you that we will explore every other possibility before we conclude that a UFO has anything to do with the case” added Captain Dawson. “Sometimes whales come into shallow water looking for food and get stuck. With the high tide the whale probably got carried up on to the salt marsh, got pushed back further in shore and then got stuck when the tide went out.”	0
781	 Is South Park actually being sued by Yelp for $10 million? Today Yelp Inc. filed a $10 million dollar lawsuit against the creators of South Park and Comedy Central. In the lawsuit, Yelp is seeking damages caused by the latest episode of South Park which lampooned the customer review and local business rating website.Paul Horner, who is a spokesman for Yelp, spoke with NBC News about details of the lawsuit.“Our company, along with its millions of users, take Yelp very seriously. The South Park episode was in extremely bad taste and not funny whatsoever. To say our critics are out there trying to get free food and using racist slurs on little Mexican children is beyond ridiculous. To compare the users of Yelp to terrorists is not only cruel, but the definition of libel and slander. I believe any reasonable court in America will agree with the lawsuit and rule in our favor.”Matt Stone and Trey Parker, creators of the popular animated series, were quick to issue a statement of their own.“We’ve taken a hard look at the information presented to us, and after reviewing it, we have given Yelp and their lawsuit only one star. Their lawyers delivered us legal documents in a very unprofessional manner; not bothering to smile or even a quick handshake. The writing on the envelope was barely legible and in two different colors. It is our personal opinion that Yelp could do a much better job by not suing us for ten million dollars.” “The rumor about a Yelp lawsuit is entirely untrue and was started by a satire site that has received far too much media credibility,” Kayleigh Winslow, a spokesperson for Yelp, [said].“We have no interest in legal action against the fantastic team that makes the South Park magic happen.”	0
368	When President Trump signed an executive order last month temporarily barring visitors from seven mostly Muslim countries, he said he was moving to protect the United States from terrorist attacks. The Homeland Security secretary, John F. Kelly, echoed the president, saying the travel ban was necessary because vetting procedures “in those seven countries are suspect. ” But an internal report written by intelligence analysts at Mr. Kelly’s department appears to undercut the assessment that people from the seven countries  —   Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen  —   pose a heightened threat of terrorism. The   report found that “country of citizenship is unlikely to be a reliable indicator of potential terrorist activity. ” The report adds to the difficulties the Trump administration has faced in carrying out the travel ban. Federal judges have suspended the order, and the administration has said it will redo it to withstand legal scrutiny, but has not given a timetable. The Department of Homeland Security assessment, first reported by The Associated Press, found that only a small number of people from the seven countries had been involved in   activities in the United States since the Syrian civil war began in 2011. In addition, the report noted, while terrorist groups in Iraq, Syria and Yemen pose a threat to the United States, militant groups in the other four countries have a more regional focus. The report also found that in the past six years, the terrorism threat reached much more widely than the seven countries listed  —   individuals from 26 countries had been “inspired” to carry out attacks in the United States. Furthermore, few individuals from the seven countries affected by the ban have access to the United States, the report said, noting the small numbers of visas granted by the State Department to citizens of those nations. The White House and the Department of Homeland Security sought to play down the significance of the report. The White House said that it was politically motivated and disregarded information that would have provided support for the travel ban. The Department of Homeland Security said the report was just a draft and “not a final comprehensive review of the government’s intelligence. ” Stephen Miller, a senior aide to Mr. Trump, told Fox News on Tuesday that the redrawn executive order would “have the same basic policy outcome. ” The Trump administration on Friday also took the first steps toward following through on the president’s plan to build a wall along the border with Mexico. Customs and Border Protection, an agency within the Department of Homeland Security, announced that it would begin accepting design proposals for a wall. The agency said it would need the proposals by March 10. After it chooses a list of potential vendors, full proposals would be required a few weeks later. The agency said it could make a final decision by the middle of April.	1
19	WASHINGTON  —   A federal appeals panel on Thursday unanimously rejected President Trump’s bid to reinstate his ban on travel into the United States from seven largely Muslim nations, a sweeping rebuke of the administration’s claim that the courts have no role as a check on the president. The   panel, suggesting that the ban did not advance national security, said the administration had shown “no evidence” that anyone from the seven nations  —   Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen  —   had committed terrorist acts in the United States. The ruling also rejected Mr. Trump’s claim that courts are powerless to review a president’s national security assessments. Judges have a crucial role to play in a constitutional democracy, the court said. “It is beyond question,” the decision said, “that the federal judiciary retains the authority to adjudicate constitutional challenges to executive action. ” The decision was handed down by the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco. It upheld a ruling last Friday by a federal district judge, James L. Robart, who blocked key parts of the travel ban, allowing thousands of foreigners to enter the country. The appeals court acknowledged that Mr. Trump was owed deference on his immigration and national security policies. But it said he was claiming something more  —   that “national security concerns are unreviewable, even if those actions potentially contravene constitutional rights and protections. ” Within minutes of the ruling, Mr. Trump angrily vowed to fight it, presumably in an appeal to the Supreme Court. “SEE YOU IN COURT, THE SECURITY OF OUR NATION IS AT STAKE!” Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter. At the White House, the president told reporters that the ruling was “a political decision” and predicted that his administration would win an appeal “in my opinion, very easily. ” He said he had not yet conferred with his attorney general, Jeff Sessions, on the matter. The Supreme Court remains   and could deadlock. A    tie there would leave the appeals court’s ruling in place. The administration has moved fast in the case so far, and it is likely to file an emergency application to the Supreme Court in a day or two. The court typically asks for a prompt response from the other side, and it could rule soon after it received one. A decision next week, either to reinstate the ban or to continue to block it, is possible. The travel ban, one of the first executive orders Mr. Trump issued after taking office, suspended worldwide refugee entry into the United States. It also barred visitors from seven   nations for up to 90 days to give federal security agencies time to impose stricter vetting processes. Immediately after it was issued, the ban spurred chaos at airports and protests nationwide as foreign travelers found themselves stranded at immigration checkpoints by a policy that critics derided as  . The State Department said up to 60, 000 foreigners’ visas were canceled in the days immediately after the ban was imposed. The World Relief Corporation, one of the agencies that resettles refugees in the United States, called the ruling “fabulous news” for 275 newcomers who are scheduled to arrive in the next week, many of whom will be reunited with family. “We have families that have been separated for years by terror, war and persecution,” said Scott Arbeiter, the president of the organization, which will arrange for housing and jobs for the refugees in cities including Seattle Spokane, Wash. and Sacramento. “Some family members had already been vetted and cleared and were standing with tickets, and were then told they couldn’t travel,” Mr. Arbeiter said. “So the hope of reunification was crushed, and now they will be admitted. ” Several Democrats said they hoped the appeals court ruling would cow Mr. Trump into rescinding the ban. Representative Karen Bass, Democrat of California, said in a statement that the ban “is rooted in bigotry and, most importantly, it’s illegal. ” “We will not stop,” Ms. Bass said. But some Republicans cast aspersions on the Ninth Circuit’s decision and predicted that it would not withstand a challenge in the Supreme Court. “Courts ought not   sensitive national security decisions of the president,” Senator Tom Cotton, Republican of Arkansas, said in a statement. “This misguided ruling is from the Ninth Circuit, the most notoriously   court in America, and the   court at the Supreme Court,” he said. “I’m confident the administration’s position will ultimately prevail. ” Trial judges nationwide have blocked aspects of Mr. Trump’s executive order, but no other case has yet reached an appeals court. The case in front of Judge Robart, in Seattle, was filed by the states of Washington and Minnesota and is still at an early stage. The appeals court order issued Thursday ruled only on the narrow question of whether to stay a lower court’s temporary restraining order blocking the travel ban. The appeals court said the government had not justified suspending travel from the seven countries. “The government has pointed to no evidence,” the decision said, “that any alien from any of the countries named in the order has perpetrated a terrorist attack in the United States. ” The three members of the panel were Judge Michelle T. Friedland, appointed by President Barack Obama Judge William C. Canby Jr. appointed by President Jimmy Carter and Judge Richard R. Clifton, appointed by President George W. Bush. They said the states were likely to succeed at the end of the day because Mr. Trump’s order appeared to violate the due process rights of lawful permanent residents, people holding visas and refugees. The court said the administration’s legal position in the case had been a moving target. It noted that Donald F. McGahn II, the White House counsel, had issued “authoritative guidance” several days after the executive order came out, saying it did not apply to lawful permanent residents. But the court said that “we cannot rely” on that statement. “The White House counsel is not the president,” the decision said, “and he is not known to be in the chain of command for any of the executive departments.“ It also mentioned “the government’s shifting interpretations” of the executive order. In its briefs and in the arguments before the panel on Tuesday, the Justice Department’s position evolved. As the case progressed, the administration offered a backup plea for at least a partial victory. At most, a Justice Department brief said, “previously admitted aliens who are temporarily abroad now or who wish to travel and return to the United States in the future” should be allowed to enter the country despite the ban. The appeals court ultimately rejected that request, however, saying that people in the United States without authorization have due process rights, as do citizens with relatives who wish to travel to the United States. The court discussed, but did not decide, whether the executive order violated the First Amendment’s ban on government establishment of religion by disfavoring Muslims. It noted that the states challenging the executive order “have offered evidence of numerous statements by the president about his intent to implement a ‘Muslim ban. ’” And it said, rejecting another administration argument, that it was free to consider evidence about the motivation behind laws that draw seemingly neutral distinctions. But the court said it would defer a decision on the question of religious discrimination. “The political branches are far better equipped to make appropriate distinctions,” the decision said. “For now, it is enough for us to conclude that the government has failed to establish that it will likely succeed on its due process argument in this appeal. ” The court also acknowledged “the massive attention this case has garnered at even the most preliminary stages. ” “On the one hand, the public has a powerful interest in national security and in the ability of an elected president to enact policies,” the decision said. “And on the other, the public also has an interest in free flow of travel, in avoiding separation of families, and in freedom from discrimination. ” “These competing public interests,” the court said, “do not justify a stay. ” The court ruling did not affect one part of the executive order: the cap of 50, 000 refugees to be admitted in the 2017 fiscal year. That is down from the 110, 000 ceiling put in place under President Barack Obama. The order also directed the secretary of state and the secretary of homeland security to prioritize refugee claims made by persecuted members of religious minorities. As of Thursday, that means the United States will be allowed to accept only about 16, 000 more refugees this fiscal year. Since Oct. 1, the start of the fiscal year, 33, 929 refugees have been admitted, 5, 179 of them Syrians.	1
427	The   rambling voice on the telephone was disguised and garbled, and warned of a slaughter of Jews. The voice spoke of a bomb loaded with shrapnel and of an imminent “blood bath. ” Moments later, the caller hung up. The   threat to a Jewish community center turned out to be a hoax. The warning was one of at least 100 that Jewish community centers and schools have reported since the beginning of the year, a menacing pattern that has upended daily life for people in 33 states and prompted a federal investigation that has come under increasing scrutiny from lawmakers, security specialists and Jewish leaders. Combined with the recent vandalism at Jewish cemeteries in Missouri and Pennsylvania, the calls have stoked fears that a virulent   has increasingly taken hold in the early days of the Trump administration. At the beginning of an address to Congress on Tuesday night, Mr. Trump said the episodes, along with last week’s attack on two Indian immigrants in Kansas, “remind us that while we may be a nation divided on policies, we are a country that stands united in condemning hate and evil in all of its very ugly forms. ” In a meeting with state attorneys general earlier Tuesday, Mr. Trump suggested that the threats and destruction might be a politically coordinated effort to “make people look bad,” according to the attorneys general of Pennsylvania and the District of Columbia. “First, he said the acts were reprehensible,” said Attorney General Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania, a Democrat who asked Mr. Trump about the episodes during a session at the White House. “Second, he said: ‘And you’ve got to be careful it could be the reverse. This could be the reverse, trying to make people look bad. ’” Jewish leaders denounced Mr. Trump’s comments to the attorneys general, and some urged the federal government to accelerate its investigation of the threatening calls, the latest of which came on Monday. “The person or persons doing this have broken the law, and it’s the responsibility of our system to investigate it and apprehend the individual or individuals responsible,” said David Posner, the director of strategic performance for the JCC Association of North America. The Federal Bureau of Investigation has been leading an inquiry since January, and a federal law enforcement official, who was not authorized to discuss a continuing investigation, said that a single person may be making the threats using an internet calling service. Independent analysts, including extremism researchers and retired law enforcement officials, share that theory and said that, so far, they have seen no evidence of an organized effort. Though some people had suspected that the calls were recorded and automated, there was evidence to the contrary. In Milwaukee, for instance, a switchboard operator asked questions and received responses from the caller, said Mark Shapiro, the president of the Harry and Rose Samson Family Jewish Community Center. Mr. Posner said an F. B. I. official had emphasized that the investigation was a priority for the bureau, involving experts in behavioral analysis, civil rights and hate groups. “Agents and analysts across the country are working to identify and stop those responsible,” Stephen Richardson, the bureau’s assistant director for the criminal investigative division, said. “We will work to make sure that people of all races and religions feel safe in their communities and in their places of worship. ” According to Mr. Posner’s group, more than 80 community centers and day schools in the United States and Canada have been threatened, some repeatedly. The calls have come in five rounds, most recently on Monday, when there were 31 threats. Many of the calls have prompted evacuations and bomb sweeps, forcing schoolchildren from classrooms and employees to push cribs full of infants into parking lots. Retirees have been rushed from swimming pools, and offices and streets shut down. The threats are frequent and alarming, community center leaders said. “My initial reaction was, ‘This is our turn,’” said Karen Kolodny, the executive director of the JCC of   in Scarsdale, N. Y. where officials responded to a bomb threat on Monday. “My reaction was not complete shock. We thought it was going to happen at some point. ” F. B. I. data shows that most hate crimes are linked to race, ethnicity or ancestry. In 2015, the most recent year for which federal data has been released, the authorities recorded 664 episodes they classified as  . Analysts said they believed that   commentary online before last year’s presidential election had gradually escalated into more sinister behavior toward the Jewish institutions, which have long prepared for threats and often employ private security. “You started out with the hostile tweets,” said Mitchell D. Silber, who was director of intelligence analysis for the New York Police Department. “You moved to the bomb threats against JCCs and other institutions, and now you have a physical manifestation at the cemeteries with the gravestones knocked over. ” Although the F. B. I. is investigating damage to headstones at a Jewish cemetery in Philadelphia, the episode there, as well as a similar one near St. Louis, is not believed to have been the work of anyone behind the bomb threats. The bureau’s inquiry into the bomb threats is likely complicated by the reality that criminals have embraced new technology, said Ronald T. Hosko, one of Mr. Richardson’s predecessors as an assistant F. B. I. director. “This is unlikely to be little twisted Johnny calling from his parents’ house,” Mr. Hosko said. Instead, Mr. Hosko suggested, the caller could be relying on libraries, restaurants or other public places with internet access, sites that might be equipped with surveillance cameras that the F. B. I. could use to help identify someone who frequented those places at the dates and times of the calls. Each new threat, Mr. Hosko said, increased the odds of an arrest. “Every one of those contacts presents another opportunity,” he said. “It’s another dot in the pattern analysis. ” As the threats have poured in, from Albuquerque to Nashville to Providence, there have been rising worries over whether people might stay away from the centers, which also serve people of other religious backgrounds. Some have fretted that the intense public attention might be encouraging whoever is behind the calls. “Given that this is happening wave after wave, there are concerns for people’s families, and people are concerned about whether they should still send their kids to JCCs,” said Oren Segal, the director of the   League’s Center on Extremism. “When communities start   like this, it is incredibly alarming and disruptive and serves the purpose of whoever is carrying out these threats. ” But Jewish institution leaders, in interviews and in conversations with one another, have expressed more frustration than fear. “By attacking the JCC, they’re really attacking what is best about America: the diversity, the pluralism, the inclusion that one faith community can be as welcoming to other faith communities and demonstrate that through deeds on the ground,” Mr. Posner said. “That’s something we will never surrender. ”	1
648	 NAPOLI | Anatolia Vertadella, a 101-year-old Italian woman, has given birth to a 9-pound baby after a controversial ovary transplant widely criticized by medical professionals because of her advanced age, reports the Rivista Napoli.The illegal and controversial surgical operation was done in a private clinic in Turkey, where European laws on ovary transplants do not apply, admits the centennial mother who does not wish to disclose the name of the clinic where the operation was undertaken.“I am very grateful to all the team of doctors who decided to go on with the operation,” she admitted in tears. “I am so grateful to have given birth to my 17th child. This is a true blessing and a testament to the power of the creator,” she told local reporters. For anyone interested, I posted this on here 2 days ago. This is a picture of my cousin’s two week old baby. It captures a truly profound moment. I know there are a shit ton of misanthropic redditors out there that would much rather stare at dog pictures all day, but I think this is fucking beautiful.

498	As mysteriously as an   slur appeared on a house in Stamford, Conn. in January, it was covered over this week, officials said. What the house’s residents did after the   slur first appeared caused as much of a stir as the graffiti itself. The residents, Heather Lindsay, who is white, and Lexene Charles, who is black, defied a directive by the city to cover it up because they wanted to make a  point publicly about intolerance. The slur was discovered on the Saturday before Martin Luther King’s Birthday. After it had been up for three weeks, the city issued a citation for blight and warned the couple that they faced a fine of $100 a day. The police chief visited the home and offered to clean the slur, which was sprawled across a garage door. The mayor said he would help. The couple refused their offers and ignored the citation. Sometime late Tuesday night or early Wednesday morning, someone covered the graffiti with black paint, Libby Carlson, a spokeswoman for Mayor David R. Martin, said in an interview on Thursday night. The covered graffiti was discovered on Wednesday morning and reported to the city. The police canvassed neighbors, who said they had not seen who painted over the slur, Ms. Carlson said. The investigation about who painted the slur in January remains open, she said. Neither Mr. Charles nor Ms. Lindsay could be reached to comment on Thursday evening. Ms. Carlson said the city would not fine them for failing to address the graffiti. Stamford, a diverse coastal city about 30 miles northeast of New York City, and the couple have tussled over blight before. After a citation in 2012 for debris at the property, the city sued Ms. Lindsay for disregarding the notice. The fees, which continued to accumulate, exceeded $130, 000. Ms. Carlson said the mayor, the city’s lawyer and the couple were to meet on Friday in an effort to resolve that case. The city was trying to acquire the property in a foreclosure lawsuit set to go to trial next week. The couple had said the graffiti was the latest in a string of racially motivated insults directed at them, especially Mr. Charles, a Haitian immigrant. Ms. Lindsay said that since they moved into the house in 1999, several people yelled racial obscenities at him and told them that they hurt property values. Jack Bryant, the president of the Stamford N. A. A. C. P. said in an interview on Thursday night that he had met with city officials about not fining the couple. He noted that “no one has been brought to justice” for the slur, which he considered to be an isolated incident. “I don’t want people to look at Stamford as a racist town,’’ he said, “because it isn’t. ”	1

699	 On January 21 at 1:21 PM EST George Zimmerman was found dead in the backyard of his Florida home. Police say he was stabbed multiple times and had a gunshot wound to the head. A neighbor of Zimmerman said she heard a commotion, looked over the wall and saw him lifeless on the ground. That’s when she called 911.The murder of George Zimmerman happened just months after his controversial September 2015 Twitter post spread across social media, angering many Trayvon supporters. Zimmerman retweeted a photo of Trayvon Martin’s lifeless body with criminal justice investigator standing above him. The original post was tweeted by one of the Zimmerman’s fans, praising him as “a one-man army.” Zimmerman, apparently flattered, retweeted the image. Police say, as of now, they have no leads in the murder of George Zimmerman. However, they are confident that his murder had everything to do with his postings on social media. Authorities say his constant bragging of the fact that he was acquitted of the murder of Trayvon Martin finally caught up to him. “You can run if you want,” said police chief Robert Gordon. “But your wrongs will catch up to you eventually.” Zimmerman’s public image took another hit in August and September of 2015, when he got into a Twitter spat with a user who threatened to slap him and responded with the taunt “We all know how it ended for the last moron that hit me. Give it a whirl cupcake” (a none-too-subtle reference to the Trayvon Martin shooting).That was nothing compared to the furor that erupted when a Twitter user named @SeriousSlav tweeted a photograph of Trayvon Martin’s dead body lying on the grass where Zimmerman had shot him, writing, “Z-Man is a one man army” — and Zimmerman had the audacity to retweet it[.]	0

County officials say a typo on the official search warrant lead law enforcement officers to the wrong location, a warehouse in Casa Grande, where, instead of a methamphetamine operation, they found a Boeing 777 commercial airliner and a sedan.“Upon entering the premises, Pinal County Sheriff’s deputies observed a large commercial airliner parked in the center of the warehouse,” Pinal County’s Chief Investigator Adam Hutch told reporters. “The aircraft in question is white, with a gray underbelly and features red and blue stripes down the middle of fuselage.” Hutch said the plane’s tail prominently displays the all-too-familiar red and blue logo of Malaysian Airlines. Additionally, its registration number, 9M-MRO, matches that of Malaysian Airlines flight MH370 which is believed to have crashed in the southern Indian Ocean on March 8, 2014.During CNN’s The Situation Room Tuesday, Wolf Blitzer was pointedly asked by a guest what his thoughts on the aircraft were. Mr. Blitzer blinked several times while staring into the camera before saying, “I’m sorry, could you repeat that? We seem to be having some issues with the mic.” Blitzer, citing “technical difficulties,” began to tap on his earpiece before removing it entirely to inspect it. He began to blow on the earpiece, presumably to remove dust or hardened ear wax, as the segment cut to an unusually long commercial break.	0
977	 Dr. Jaleel Kohmeni raised his hand when the flight attendant on Delta flight 6978 from New York to Las Vegas asked if there was a doctor on board. He told the attendant that he wasn’t an American and that he preferred another doctor help if possible. Unfortunately, he was the man’s only hope.As he approached, he could see that the man was barely managing to breathe and going in and out of consciousness. What the doctor did next may seem normal to people where he comes from, but here it was simply disgusting. He leaned over the man and asked him if he believed in God. “Yes,” the man answered, “Jesus Christ is my Lord and Savior.”At that point, Kohmeni informed the flight attendant that he could only “give the man the comfort of knowing Allah will give him the chance to redeem himself in heaven,” but that he couldn’t help save him.	0
405	MOSCOW  —   The Kremlin, increasingly convinced that President Trump will not fundamentally change relations with Russia, is instead seeking to bolster its global influence by exploiting what it considers weakness in Washington, according to political advisers, diplomats, journalists and other analysts. Russia has continued to test the United States on the military front, with fighter jets flying close to an American warship in the Black Sea this month and a Russian naval vessel steaming conspicuously in the Atlantic off the coast of Delaware. “They think he is unstable, that he can be manipulated, that he is authoritarian and a person without a team,” Alexei A. Venediktov, the editor in chief of Echo of Moscow, a liberal radio station, said of President Trump. The Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin, has long sought to crack the liberal Western order, both as a competitor and as a champion of an alternative, illiberal model. To that end, he did what he could to buttress the electoral chances of Mr. Trump, who seemed like a kindred spirit with his harsh denunciations of NATO and the European Union, his endorsement of the British withdrawal from the European Union and his repeated shrugs over Russia’s destabilizing Ukraine. In this context, Mr. Trump’s election was an unexpected bonus, but the original giddiness has worn off, and Moscow has returned to its    formula of creating turmoil and exploiting the resulting opportunities. “They are all telling each other that this is great, he created this turbulence inside, as we wanted, and now he is focused on his domestic problems and we have more freedom to maneuver,” Mr. Venediktov said. “Let them deal with their own problems. There, not in Ukraine. There, not in the Middle East. There, not in NATO. This is the state of mind right now. ” Sergei A. Markov, a leading analyst friendly to the Kremlin, made much the same point. “Right now the Kremlin is looking for ways that Russia can use the chaos in Washington to pursue its own interests,” said Mr. Markov, a member of the Civic Chamber, a Kremlin advisory group. “The main hope is that the U. S. will be preoccupied with itself and will stop pressuring Russia. ” Any turbulence that Russia foments also gives the Kremlin leverage that it can try to trade in the global arena at a time when it does not have much that others want. Mr. Venediktov compared the Russian position to an intrusive neighbor who promises to be helpful by avoiding noisy restoration activity at night even though it breaks the apartment building rules in the first place. Analysts say the Kremlin is aware that the tactic of creating and exploiting disarray can become   in that prolonged instability could allow threats like the extremist group Islamic State to flourish. “It is important for Russia that America does its job in foreign policy,” said Alexey Chesnakov, a periodic Kremlin political adviser and the director of the Center for Current Politics, a trend analysis group in Moscow. “If there is nobody to do that job, it might not be good for us, either. ” The Middle East provides examples of both vectors, analysts say, a moment of chaos to exploit and concerns about achieving stability for the   future. Moscow has begun courting Libya, where Mr. Putin seems to want to prove that the Obama administration and other Western powers made a mistake by working to force Col. Muammar   from power in 2011. Russia invited various powerful figures to Moscow and sent the country’s lone aircraft carrier, the somewhat dilapidated Admiral Kuznetsov, on a port call to Libya on its way back from Syria last month. Khalifa Haftar, the military commander in eastern Libya, got a tour. The government invited veteran officials and analysts from around the Arab world this week to discuss the future of Libya and Yemen, among other topics. Syria, on the other hand, underscores the limits to Russian power. In the two months since   government forces took back the city of Aleppo, there has been little movement in forging peace. Not least, Russia can ill afford the billions of dollars needed to rebuild the country. For that it needs Washington to help persuade its allies like Qatar and Saudi Arabia, who all seek a political transition away from Syrian President Bashar  . Like much of the world, nobody in Moscow can figure out who makes Mr. Trump’s foreign policy, never mind what it will be. Since the inauguration, it has become clear that Mr. Trump’s rosy view of Mr. Putin is not shared by the president’s top foreign policy advisers, with the possible exception of Stephen K. Bannon, his chief White House strategist. “We cannot understand how they will work in concert,” said Igor Yurgens, a Russian economist who is prominent in business and development. The Kremlin has adopted a    attitude toward Mr. Trump, analysts said, expecting the first meeting with Mr. Putin in Europe sometime this summer to set the course for relations. Dmitry K. Kiselyov, the anchor of the main state propaganda program “News of the Week,” recently pronounced what seemed to be the new party line on the air. “Let’s not judge too harshly, things are still unsettled in the White House,” he said. “Still not a word from there. Only little words, and that doesn’t amount to a policy. ” Just how unsettled was underscored on Monday, when the White House announced plans to increase military spending by $54 billion, an amount just about equal to what Russia spends in total on its military annually. While the appearance of such turmoil in the White House has probably been surprising, even gratifying, to the Kremlin, analysts say Russia’s government is worried about having too much of a good thing. “It would be better for us to have a predictable partner,” Mr. Markov said. “An unpredictable one is dangerous. ” The perception of weakness calls into question here in Moscow whether Mr. Trump can ever live up to the many statements he made during the campaign about forging closer ties with Mr. Putin and Russia. “The overwhelming view of the Kremlin is that Trump is not very strong,” said Valeriy Solovey, a professor at the Moscow State Institute of International Relations. “He might have sympathy toward Russia, but he is contained within the political establishment. ” Russia’s far right regularly predicts Mr. Trump’s assassination at the hands of the American establishment, a view occasionally echoed on state television. Alexander Dugin, a nationalist Russian philosopher, called Mr. Trump’s inauguration the happiest day of his life because it signified the demise of the liberal international order. Mr. Dugin seemed most eager for Mr. Trump to get on with his promise to “drain the swamp” in Washington, although he worried about the consequences. “It can kill,” Mr. Dugin said in an interview. “It is not so easy to drain the swamp. ” Since the inauguration, however, enthusiasm for Mr. Trump in official Russia lurched from cool to uncool seemingly overnight. Dmitri S. Peskov, the presidential spokesman, denied that the new skepticism had been ordered from the top. The speed of the change was striking, however. Russia’s political class marvels at how much time it now spends chewing over the minutiae of the American political system. Some attribute that to the fact that domestic politics are comatose, with Mr. Putin assured of winning another   term in 2018. “Nobody is talking about the Putin election,” said Mr. Chesnakov, the political consultant. “We are discussing relations between Congress and Trump. ”	1
383	It is impossible to know what Grady O’Cummings III might have represented to the group of youngsters he was holding court with in this photo taken in September 1963. Mr. O’Cummings, who was photographed with the youngsters outside his office in Harlem, announced the next month that he would seek the Democratic nomination to run for president in 1964. He was one of the first   to run for president. Certainly Mr. O’Cummings must have represented hope and possibility to the boys who had gathered around him that day. Dedicated to economic and political empowerment for blacks, Mr. O’Cummings founded the National Civil Rights Party in 1963 to foster black enterprise and to appeal to liberal whites. He said at the time that the organization had 450 members, with branches in Chicago, Cleveland and Philadelphia. The party designated him its presidential nominee days before he decided to run as a Democrat. It will never be known where Mr. O’Cummings’s ambitious political aspirations might have taken him. His dreams appeared to be cut short when it was reported that he had had a massive heart attack and died at home in November 1969, at just 36. The New York Times ran an obituary about the unexpected death of the promising political novice who, sadly, was lost in his prime. Or was he? Mr. O’Cummings was not quite the determined political    that he seemed. He had faked his death and was very much alive when he bamboozled The Times and The Amsterdam News into publishing his obituary. In fact, this report might well also serve as the newspaper’s long overdue correction. For it was only during the reporting for this article that The Times realized it had written of Mr. O’Cummings’s hoax. This is what actually happened. Just four months after he sent in his obituary to The Times, he    —   at a news conference in Brooklyn, which went unnoticed by The Times. For an explanation of why he faked his death, Mr. O’Cummings said he had simply been trying to elude members of the Black Panthers, who he said had made death threats against him and his family, according to an article about the news conference in The Amsterdam News. “I had to get out because I was trying to protect my family,” The News quoted Mr. O’Cummings as saying. He explained that he had fled to Buffalo, where he remained for months. “My wife, Winnie, was assaulted by four Black Panthers, and it made me very angry. I didn’t go to the police because I am not an informer and didn’t want to get involved. ” The News’s account never explained why he had decided that the threat to his family had diminished enough in just four months for him to   and in such public and dramatic fashion. Perhaps at least partly because he had misled the public, he never attained the political success he sought. Years before, Mr. O’Cummings’s presidential run had proved to be as   as his faked death. In early March 1964, about five months after he was designated the presidential candidate of his National Civil Rights Party, he withdrew and said he would become his party’s candidate for the seat held by Representative John J. Rooney, a Democrat, in Brooklyn’s 14th Congressional District (as reported by The  Times in a brief article). Several decades later, The Times did mention Mr. O’Cummings and his candidacy for City Council, in an article about the 1993 race. Even then, though, the newspaper did not correct the story of his death or run an editor’s note about it. Professionally, Mr. O’Cummings worked in public relations, including as the community relations representative for the Welfare Policemen’s Benevolent Association. He was a native of Greenville, S. C. who graduated from City College of New York. Mr. O’Cummings also was publisher of New York Speakout, a weekly newspaper in Brooklyn, where he lived. And he served as a president of the youth council of the Manhattan division of the N. A. A. C. P. Mr. O’Cummings went on to live a long life. As for his death, it is never too late to set the record straight. The Times can now report with the authority of having seen Mr. O’Cummings’s death certificate that he died of natural causes on June 2, 1996, at the age of 63. It was 27 years after his obituary appeared in this publication. The Times did not publish a second one. This series will be part of a book with additional unseen photographs, and new stories, titled “Unseen: Unpublished Black History From the New York Times Archives,” to be published by Black Dog  Leventhal in the fall of 2017.	1
461	The president of Russia, Vladimir V. Putin, articulated a possible legal strategy on Wednesday for scores of Russian athletes preparing to defend themselves in sports doping prosecutions: casting doubt on the chain of custody for their urine samples. “When we provided the test samples, there were no complaints,” Mr. Putin said, going on to describe the microscopic scratches on glass sample bottles that investigators said showed that Russia’s Federal Security Service had cracked into them to switch out the athletes’ incriminating urine. “If there was a problem with scratches of whatever kind, this should have been noted in the relevant reports, but there was nothing of this sort. In other words, these samples were stored somewhere, and we cannot be held responsible for the storage conditions,” he said. The scores of glass bottles in question from the 2014 Sochi Olympics  —   bottles thought to be   before last year’s scandal  —   have been stored by the International Olympic Committee in a secure lab in Switzerland for the last three years. All are being   by the committee. Its ultimate disciplinary decisions, unlikely to come before the spring, are expected to be followed by challenges in the Court of Arbitration for Sport. That could push deliberation into next year and further confuse the eligibility of Russian Olympians leading to the 2018 Winter Games in Pyeongchang, South Korea. Mr. Putin, who has been largely dismissive of the evidence exposing an elaborate Russian doping operation, also expressed respect for the World   Agency, the global antidoping regulator, and the investigations it had commissioned into Russia’s cheating. “We must pay heed to what this independent commission says, despite the shortcomings in its work,” he said, referring to a team led by the Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren that concluded in December that 1, 000 Russian athletes were involved in a   doping program. “We must pay heed to its work and its results, and to WADA’s demands, because we need to acknowledge that there are established and identified cases of doping here, and this is a totally unacceptable situation,” he said. Mr. Putin’s remarks  —   delivered in Krasnoyarsk, a city in eastern Siberia that is preparing to host the 2019 University Games  —   signaled a shift after months of rejecting the basic conclusions of Mr. McLaren’s inquiry. Regulators have said Russia must accept those conclusions or credibly rebut them to return to good standing in international competition. The Russian doping scandal upended global sports last year, months before the 2016 Olympics, when the nation’s former antidoping lab chief, Dr. Grigory Rodchenkov, delivered an insider’s account of Russia’s   conspiracy to drug surreptitiously and dominate global standings, most notably at the Sochi Olympics, where it controlled the   lab and had an opportunity to break into the bottles overnight. Since Dr. Rodchenkov spoke out and Mr. McLaren confirmed his story, Mr. Putin and Vitaly Mutko, Russia’s deputy prime minister and former sports minister, have delivered inconsistently conciliatory and defiant responses to the scandal. But with the I. O. C. having begun disciplinary proceedings for doping against 28 Russian Olympians who competed in Sochi, Mr. Putin’s remarks on Wednesday addressed specific facts about the case against his nation’s Olympians. Since leaving Sochi, the doping samples in question have been stored by the I. O. C. in a secure lab in Switzerland. And the University of Lausanne is collaborating with the committee in developing a methodology to scrutinize doping samples, according to Dr. Richard Budgett, the medical and scientific director of the I. O. C. “It has to be recorded extremely carefully. That’s why it’s taking a couple months,” Dr. Budgett said. While Mr. Putin referred to other shortcomings in the array of evidence assembled  —   including what he described as “inaccurate translations or inadequate evidence” presented by Mr. McLaren to international sports officials  —   his overall message on Wednesday was a broad acknowledgment of institutional failures. “Our existing antidoping monitoring system has not worked effectively, and this is our fault, and is something we need to admit and address directly,” Mr. Putin said. In December, top Russian sports officials acknowledged to The New York Times that “an institutional conspiracy” had implicated multiple employees of the government’s sports ministry. They insisted, however  —   as Mr. Putin repeated on Wednesday  —   that the schemes had not been supported by the state, which many officials defined as Mr. Putin and a few of his top associates. Mr. Putin’s remarks came one day after United States lawmakers called a congressional hearing, expressing outrage at Russia’s cheating and what they called global sports officials’ insufficient response to the scandal. “Exactly how far and who was involved  —   we don’t yet know,” Dr. Budgett, who testified at the hearing, said afterward. He acknowledged that Russia’s Federal Security Service had played a part and that Russia’s deputy sports minister had been dismissed for his involvement. “That’s what the commission is doing, getting to the bottom of who was involved within the Russian state and the Russian system. ”	1

556	 A Las Vegas mom was arrested on Tuesday after an acquaintance called the police saying that the mother was doing body modifications on the child. 19-year-old Tonya Creighton says she was just trying to make her daughter look “cool” and meant no harm to the baby. Child Protective Services was called to the scene and the baby was removed from Creighton and put in their custody.According to the anonymous tip made by Creighton’s acquaintance, the mother and the baby’s father, 22-year-old Brian Shekel gave the baby Benadryl to calm her down and applied a numbing agent to her ears. They then began the “Ear Pointing” surgery on the child, which is usually performed by a plastic surgeon at a cost of around $3000. According to the parents confession, they knew they would find no plastic surgeon willing to do it to the child and they “could not afford it because they had no jobs and their only income is welfare.”“I don’t see what the big deal is,” said Creighton in her statement to the police. “That’s my child and I should have the right to do whatever I want to do with her. There was no harm done and everybody is doing it anyway and it looks cool. Our friend up the street did our ears and we didn’t need no plastic surgeon.

136	BEIT EL, West Bank  —   There’s the Friedman Faculty House, the Rabbi Morris Friedman Center for Computer Sciences, a Friedman fitness room at a   academy, a playground and a plaza. The plaques dedicating sites around Beit El, a religious Jewish settlement deep in the   West Bank, attest to years of financial, emotional and family bonds nurtured by an American lawyer, David M. Friedman, and his wife, Tammy. Under previous administrations, American diplomats have been barred from setting foot in such settlements, viewed by most of the world as a violation of international law and branded by the Obama administration as “illegitimate. ” But Mr. Friedman, President Trump’s pick for ambassador to Israel, upends the conventional protocols and has espoused views to the right of Israel’s conservative prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. Mr. Friedman, an Orthodox Jewish bankruptcy lawyer from Long Island, has rejected the internationally accepted   solution for the   conflict. And as president of the American   arm of Beit El’s yeshiva complex, he has raised millions of dollars for its related institutions, including housing projects for teachers and students. He has made almost yearly visits there during the Jewish holiday Sukkot. In the days leading up to Mr. Netanyahu’s first meeting with Mr. Trump as president, and Mr. Friedman’s confirmation hearings, which are expected to start on Thursday, the mood in Beit El seemed to encapsulate all the uncertainty and contradictions manifested by the new administration. On the one hand, Mr. Trump publicly signaled last week that the administration had neared its limit with settlement expansion, saying in an interview that he did not believe it to be “a good thing for peace. ” But Mr. Trump’s foundation once made a $10, 000 donation to Beit El’s yeshiva institutions in honor of the Friedmans. And the parents of Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump’s    and adviser, have donated generously, Yaakov Katz, a founder of Beit El and its   enterprise, said in a radio interview in December. Swinging between hopes of almost unbridled settlement growth and skepticism, several residents said they were “cautiously optimistic. ” Located north of the Palestinian city of Ramallah, in the heartland of the territory of any future Palestinian state, Beit El is an ideological hotbed of the settler movement and has strong biblical associations. Its name is Hebrew for house of God, and some scholars have identified its location as the place where Jacob, the biblical patriarch, laid his head on a pillow of stones and dreamed of angels ascending and descending a ladder between heaven and earth. A large, upright stone on a terraced hillside on the edge of the settlement is revered as the one that Jacob slept on, then anointed with oil, after God appeared in the dream and promised all the land around to him and his progeny. Archaeological excavations in the area have found signs of ancient life. The Palestinian village of Beitin sits on a nearby hill. Mr. Netanyahu has said in the past that he would not evacuate Beit El under any agreement with the Palestinians, even though it lies outside the major settlement blocs that Israeli leaders have more generally insisted on keeping. Founded in 1977 on private Palestinian land originally seized by Israel for military purposes, the settlement was later approved by the Israeli courts under the rubric of general security. Now it is home to about 6, 500 people who mostly live in modest,     or   buildings. There are plans in the pipeline for at least 300 new apartments in   buildings to be constructed on a rise by the entrance to the settlement. But the yeshiva complex has so far proven to be Beit El’s main engine of growth. Considered a prime institution of religious Zionism, the yeshiva is headed by Rabbi Zalman Baruch Melamed, a   who has denounced homosexuality as a “perversion” and “a severe mental illness” and has ruled that it is forbidden for soldiers or police to participate in the evacuation of settlements. On a recent morning, dozens of yeshiva students in their late teens or early 20s were huddled over Talmudic texts, alone or in pairs, in the vast hall of a new building that was completed last year. “Beit El’s greatest ‘product’ is its educational institutions,” said Chaim Silberstein, a South   resident and member of the local council who moved here as a yeshiva student in the 1980s. “It’s an industry. ” Mr. Katz, known as Ketzale, was the driving force behind the yeshiva, its religious high schools for boys and girls and the   academy. A charismatic former member of the Israeli Parliament from a   party, Mr. Katz, a staunch nationalist, is credited with building up the   network in the United States and bringing in tens of millions of dollars. Mr. Friedman’s late father, Morris, commemorated on a plaque as a “founding member of Beit El,” was one of the first American Jews to meet Mr. Katz when he started going to the United States more than quarter of a century ago and could barely speak English, according to Mr. Silberstein. Another was Eugen Gluck, Beit El’s main American benefactor, whose name graces the settlement’s clinic. When Mr. Friedman’s nomination was announced, Mr. Katz praised him on his Facebook page as a pioneering philanthropist and settlement builder. Posting a photograph of the two of them on a boat, Mr. Katz described Mr. Friedman as “like a brother to me. ” Mr. Silberstein emphasized that the money was raised for the educational institutions, not the settlement itself  —   an important distinction for the contributions to qualify as   donations to settlements under American tax laws. But the yeshiva complex is a multitentacled enterprise. Its institutions include the Arutz Sheva news site, for which Mr. Friedman has written a number of columns, and Besheva weekly. Arutz Sheva, which caters to Israel’s nationalist camp, started out as a pirate radio station broadcasting from a ship acquired by Mr. Katz. The yeshiva complex also runs a tour company and a rabbinical website. One of the stated goals of its online efforts, it says, is to “delegitimize the notion of the   solution,” spreading its influence far beyond the geographical confines of Beit El. Then there is the real estate. Among the projects built to accommodate yeshiva staff members and students was the Ulpana neighborhood, which was partially evacuated in 2012 by court order because it was built illegally on private Palestinian land. According to the newspaper Haaretz, many fraudulent land deals in Beit El were subsequently found to have been covered up by forged documents. The government retroactively approved another project of 20 apartments in a building under construction when it announced thousands of new settlement housing units last month. Wedged between existing buildings, the project had to be redesigned because parts of it were also found to have encroached on   land. Peace Now, an Israeli   group, recently revealed that the latest plan was developed by the nonprofit Sukkat Ovadia Learning Center, another beneficiary of the Friends of the Beit El Yeshiva network, having received more than $600, 000 in 2015, according to its financial reports. Mr. Silberstein, the council member, said that old land records of the area were notoriously imprecise and that many, though not all, of the building irregularities were innocent mistakes. Mr. Friedman, he added, was a settlement builder in a “figurative” sense. “Any donor likes to think he’s a builder,” Mr. Silberstein said. “A donor doesn’t like to pay for salaries and food. ” Beit El’s other concerns are   by comparison: a factory for tefillin, or phylacteries a bakeshop called Herby’s and some workshops for aluminum and carpentry. Local Palestinians are employed, mainly in construction. Even after 40 years, there is a constant tension between the temporary and the permanent. Mr. Silberstein said his “macro outlook” was to create a momentum in building throughout the West Bank that would lead to an “irreversible situation” and “solidify Israel’s presence in its historic homeland. ” At the micro level, he said, he hopes Beit El’s population will reach 10, 000 in the next five years and ensure that even in the event of any withdrawal from the territory, Beit El would end up within Israel’s borders. Elena Mordechai, a special education assistant and mother of nine, moved here from Jerusalem in the 1990s. She said her friends thought she was crazy to invest in Beit El then, when Israel and the Palestinians seemed poised to reach a territorial agreement. Now she puts her faith in God. “We trust that the one who is running things is the Holy One, blessed be he, up there,” she said. “Not Bibi,” she added, referring to Mr. Netanyahu by his nickname, “and not Trump. ”	1
277	STOCKHOLM  —   Residents in a northwestern suburb predominantly inhabited by immigrants have clashed with police officers, two days after President Trump unleashed a vague but pointed critique of Sweden’s migration policies. About 20 to 30 masked men threw stones and other objects at police officers in the suburb, Rinkeby, after the police arrested a man on suspicion of dealing drugs. A police officer fired at the perpetrators but did not strike anyone, and the disturbances continued for several more hours, stretching into early Tuesday morning. A photojournalist was injured in the clashes. (The police initially classified the gunshot as a warning shot.) The episode drew scrutiny worldwide because of Mr. Trump’s assertions  —   based on a Fox News segment  —   that Sweden had experienced a surge in crime and violence as a result of taking in large numbers of refugees. Mr. Trump’s comments were greeted with anger in Sweden, the latest example of strong criticism by the American president antagonizing friendly countries, including neighbors like Mexico and allies like Australia and the European Union. Swedish officials criticized Mr. Trump’s statements about crime in the country as exaggerations. Preliminary statistics do not show a major increase in crime from 2015, when the country processed a record 163, 000 asylum applications, to 2016. Disturbances like the one in Rinkeby, officials said, are not unprecedented but are infrequent. In 2013, the police shooting of a man wielding a knife led to nights of violence in the suburbs of Stockholm, including Rinkeby. Interior Minister Anders Ygeman called the clashes on Monday “very serious. ” But, he added: “There is work being done to make our suburbs and socially vulnerable areas safer. Sometimes it can get a little messy, but the police are not backing down. ” Nonetheless, the disturbances in Rinkeby were seized upon by some people online as evidence of Mr. Trump’s claim. Rinkeby, an economically deprived area of about 16, 000 people, is overwhelmingly populated by residents with immigrant backgrounds.   news media in the United States and elsewhere have insisted that Sweden is covering up evidence of   crime  —   a claim officials in this prosperous Scandinavian nation, which has a long humanitarian tradition, have rejected. Lars Bystrom, a police spokesman, said the police were summoned at 8:18 p. m. on Monday to the transit station in Rinkeby, about seven miles northwest of Stockholm’s City Hall, after officers made a   arrest and were set upon by residents. A police officer fired a live round of ammunition as a warning shot. “No one was hit, but it had the intended effect of clearing the scene so that police could make an arrest,” Mr. Bystrom said. The clashes intensified, with up to 70 people throwing stones and objects, before the police finally got the situation under control around 12:15 a. m. he said. Asked whether there was enough of a police presence in Rinkeby, Mr. Bystrom cited the district police chief, Niklas Andersson, in describing police resources in the area as plentiful. But Mr. Bystrom also said that officials would continue to bolster security. Patrik Derk, the district director for   the northernmost of the boroughs that make up the municipality of Stockholm, said it would be a mistake to see proof of Mr. Trump’s claims in the unrest. “This type of problem exists in most countries, even in the U. S. A. ,” he said in a phone interview. “And we are managing these problems and will succeed with this. They’re complex problems. ” Mr. Derk was hired in late 2015 to “make Rinkeby a better place to grow up and live in,” as he put it. He previously helped turn around the Hovsjo district of Sodertalje, a city southwest of Stockholm that, like Rinkeby, has a large population of   immigrants. “We created jobs through building development initiatives and training unemployed youth,” he said, adding that the efforts involved collaboration with the police as well as economic investments. “And that’s what we are trying to do here, create a condition for the residents to live a good life in the area. ” Mr. Derk acknowledged that Rinkeby had significant problems: “It is one of the more troubled areas in terms of school results, tight quarters, unemployment. ” Benjamin Dousa, 24, an appointed member of a local board in Rinkeby that distributes public money for schools, social services, parks and recreation, and elder care, wrote in an opinion essay that Mr. Trump’s critique had some merit. “A battered journalist, stones thrown at the police and stores that are being plundered, unfortunately, are not unusual occurrences where I live,” Mr. Dousa, whose father was a Turkish immigrant to Sweden, wrote in the essay, published in the newspaper Expressen. “I hear the police helicopter every other day. ” He said that in the neighborhood, “this type of criminality has become part of everyday life. ” The prime minister, Stefan Lofven, has said that complaints that migrants are driving a crime surge are exaggerations. Mr. Trump’s critique was made in response to a Fox News interview with Ami Horowitz, an American filmmaker who argues that migrants in Sweden have fed a rise in violent crime.   news media like Breitbart and Infowars have also pointed repeatedly to Sweden as a case study of the failure of immigrants to assimilate. Mr. Dousa said in a phone interview that he was familiar with the     news reports. “Of course, some of them are fake, but the situation in Rinkeby is not good,” he said. “The police don’t have control over the area. That’s not fake news. ” Mr. Horowitz has not responded to requests for an interview about his videos, which Swedish officials say contain errors and distortions. But Mr. Dousa said he was sympathetic to Mr. Horowitz’s argument that Swedish elites are unwilling to talk about the problems associated with migration. “If you said you had a problem with integration in Sweden, you would be called a racist,” he said, adding that the situation has been changing: “The debate has opened up. ” Questions about migration policy are being raised not only by the Sweden Democrats, a   party, but also by   parties, he said. Asked about Mr. Dousa’s characterization of the problem, Mr. Derk said he agreed that more police officers were needed and that many young men in the community had criminal backgrounds. But, he said, officials should “address the underlying problem of unemployment and cramped living conditions. ” He added: “We need to develop relationships on the spot with the residents. We need to motivate people to leave criminality by creating work. ”	1
89	WASHINGTON  —   The Justice Department said in a brief filed on Monday that it would continue to defend President Trump’s targeted travel ban in the federal appeals court in San Francisco, which on Thursday refused to reinstate it. The department did not say whether it would try to appeal that ruling to the Supreme Court. But its silence on the matter suggested that the Trump administration will not pursue an immediate appeal. The administration had asked a   appeals court panel for prompt action to avert a national security emergency  —   and was rebuffed last week  —   after a trial judge had blocked the ban, allowing refugees and visitors from seven   nations into the United States. The Justice Department has moved at a more deliberate pace since its loss last Thursday, an indication that it will not file an emergency application in the Supreme Court. The administration may have decided that the chances of success at the Supreme Court are poor. For the last year, the court has had just eight members, and a    tie would leave the appeals court ruling in place. It would take five votes to overturn the ruling, and it appears unlikely that any of the court’s four more liberal justices would support the administration’s position. The Justice Department asked the trial judge, Judge James L. Robart, of the Federal District Court in Seattle, to “postpone any further proceedings” in his court while the appeals court, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, considers whether to rehear the case. Lawyers for the states of Washington and Minnesota, which are challenging the ban, urged Judge Robart to order the parties to start exchanging information in preparation for trial. “Given the gravity of the states’ constitutional allegations, defendants’ stated national security concerns, and the public interests at stake, the states respectfully submit that discovery should proceed without delay,” Noah G. Purcell, Washington’s solicitor general, wrote. At a hearing on Monday afternoon in Seattle, Michelle Bennett, a Justice Department lawyer, urged Judge Robart to halt proceedings in the trial court. Judge Robart said he was surprised to hear her make that argument, in light of a statement from Mr. Trump after the Ninth Circuit’s ruling. “‘See you in court,’” Judge Robart said, quoting a Twitter post by Mr. Trump, which drew a laugh in the courtroom. “I’m not prepared to slow this down,” Judge Robart said. “There is a very sensitive time issue. ” Unless the appeals court or the Supreme Court acts, Judge Robart’s Feb. 3 temporary restraining order, which blocked the key provisions of targeted travel ban, will remain in place. The ban, one of the first executive orders Mr. Trump issued after taking office, suspended worldwide refugee entry into the United States. It also suspended travel from seven   nations  —   Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen  —   for 90 days. On Thursday, a   panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco, refused to stay Judge Robart’s order. On Friday, an unidentified appeals court judge called for a vote on whether the   panel’s ruling should be reheard by a larger panel of the Ninth Circuit. Those briefs are due Thursday. If a majority of the court’s active judges voted to rehear the case, it would typically be considered by an   panel made up of the circuit’s chief judge and 10 judges chosen at random. Rehearing motions filed by parties and requests for votes on rehearings requested by judges are not particularly unusual. The Ninth Circuit rehears decisions issued by   panels 15 to 25 times a year, the court said. The Ninth Circuit has 25 active judges, 18 of whom were appointed by Democratic presidents. In a separate order, the   panel last Thursday set a schedule for submitting briefs in the underlying appeal. (The question decided on Thursday was whether to stay the trial court order. The question at issue in the new briefs is whether that ruling was correct.) The last of those briefs is due March 29. Judge Robart, meanwhile, was considering on Monday what should happen in his court in the meantime. Last Friday, he asked the states and the Justice Department to file briefs on whether there was a need for further proceedings in his court. Ordinarily, after a temporary restraining order is issued, the parties would file additional briefs and perhaps submit evidence on whether to make the order more permanent by entering a preliminary injunction. Before the Ninth Circuit ruled, Judge Robart ordered the parties to file those briefs starting on Feb. 9 and ending on Feb. 17. But the Ninth Circuit’s ruling complicated matters by treating the order as a preliminary injunction, suggesting that there was nothing more for Judge Robart to do for now. Mr. Purcell said that was the right interpretation of the appeals court’s ruling. “In short, because the Ninth Circuit has construed the Feb. 3 order to grant all the preliminary relief the states would have sought through a motion for a preliminary injunction, no additional briefing or evidence is required in the district court on the propriety of preliminary relief,” Mr. Purcell wrote. The Justice Department, in a brief signed by Ms. Bennett, did not take a firm position on that question, saying only that “further proceedings in the Ninth Circuit will likely inform whether additional proceedings on a preliminary injunction motion are necessary in the district court. ”	1
584	 The rumors were true after all. Donald Trump just admitted he was a Hillary Clinton plant the whole time.Many have suspected as much but now Donald Trump himself has admitted that he is running as a Republican to ensure Hillary Clinton will win in November. Trump revealed via Twitter that he made a deal with Hillary in late May mere weeks before he announced his run.After Donald Trump made this announcement we reached out to his incarcerated campaign manager Corey Lewandoski who filled us in on the whole story:Electing Hillary Clinton, the most disliked Democrat politician in decades, would have been impossible unless she were running against a Republican that was even worse. Although, it couldn’t just be any Republican, it would have to be the absolute worst Republican in the country. It would have to be a Republican that was so bad even other Republicans would denounce them. It would have to be someone that would split the party and ensure Hillary could win the White House with only 40% of the vote.	0
313	WASHINGTON  —   Working from an office suite behind a Burger King in southern Virginia, operatives used a web of shadowy cigarette sales to funnel tens of millions of dollars into a secret bank account. They weren’t known smugglers, but rather agents from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. The operation, not authorized under Justice Department rules, gave agents an    way to finance undercover investigations and pay informants without the usual cumbersome paperwork and close oversight, according to court records and people close to the operation. The secret account is at the heart of a federal racketeering lawsuit brought by a collective of tobacco farmers who say they were swindled out of $24 million. A pair of A. T. F. informants received at least $1 million each from that sum, records show. The scheme relied on phony shipments of snack food disguised as tobacco. The agents were experts: Their job was to catch cigarette smugglers, so they knew exactly how it was done. Government records and interviews with people involved reveal an operation that existed on a murky frontier  —   between investigating smuggling and being complicit in it. After The New York Times began asking about the operation last summer, the Justice Department disclosed it to the department’s inspector general’s office, which is investigating. The inspector general “expressed serious concerns,” court records show. It is unclear how broadly the A. T. F. adopted this practice, at what level it was approved, and whether it continues. Nearly all references to the A. T. F. have been blacked out of public court records, and most documents are entirely sealed. The investigation and the looming racketeering trial will bring renewed scrutiny to the A. T. F. which has been buffeted in recent years by the botched   operation known as Fast and Furious and its mismanagement of undercover investigations. Representative Jason Chaffetz, whose House oversight committee investigated Fast and Furious, asked the A. T. F. on Wednesday for reams of documents related to the secret tobacco account. Members of Congress, particularly Republicans, have heaped criticism on the agency for decades, and the National Rifle Association has lobbied to limit the agency’s authority and funding. While government auditors have previously cited problems with A. T. F. ’s tobacco investigations, this operation went beyond what was identified in that audit, released in 2013. The A. T. F. and the Justice Department declined to comment. Documents in the racketeering lawsuit outline the A. T. F. operation. The tobacco cooperative is suing a former employee and a consultant who, according to court documents, both worked as A. T. F. informants. The informants have denied all wrongdoing. Part of their defense, records show, is that they acted on behalf of the government. In response, a judge recently added the United States government as a defendant. Since last summer, The Times has fought to make all the documents public, but the Justice Department has argued successfully in court to keep them secret. Crucial details, however, have been revealed through poor redaction, documents that were filed publicly by mistake and the sheer difficulty of keeping so much a secret for so long. In spring 2011, U. S. Tobacco Cooperative was looking to expand its distribution network. The   is made up of about 700 tobacco farmers  —   from Virginia to Florida  —   who pool their crops and share the profits. Based in Raleigh, N. C. the company is a major exporter to China and produces   cigarettes including Wildhorse, Traffic and 1839. “These are really, really good people,” said Stuart D. Thompson, the cooperative’s chief executive. “Every year, they take all their chips. They put them on the table, and they hope they get them all back. ” The company began negotiating to buy a tobacco distributor in Bristol, Va. Big South Wholesale. Big South’s owners, Jason Carpenter and Christopher Small, had a network of customers and owned a warehouse. They also had an existing secret relationship with the A. T. F. records show. The two men have filed court documents acknowledging “participation in undercover law enforcement activities. ” And a judge’s sealed order, which is publicly available online, revealed that the two men worked “on behalf of various government agencies, primarily the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. ” The basics of cigarette smuggling are simple. Each state sets its tobacco taxes. Buying cigarettes in   states, like Virginia, and secretly selling them in   states, like New York, generates large profits. More complicated schemes have shipped cigarettes to Indian reservations, where they are not taxed, then rerouted them for sale on the black market. A. T. F. agents try to disrupt these networks. Often that means working with informants to buy and sell tobacco on the black market, much the way agents pose as drug dealers to investigate cartels. Because so much of the case remains sealed, Mr. Carpenter and Mr. Small are prohibited from answering questions about nearly every aspect of the case. “Everything we did that is being attacked now in litigation, we did in good faith,” they said in a statement. Exactly who at U. S. Tobacco knew about their A. T. F. ties and what they knew are a matter of dispute. But there were signs that Big South was not a simple tobacco distributor. Its assets included more than two dozen vehicles, including expensive S. U. V.s and a fleet of Mercedes, BMW, Audi, Lexus and Jaguar sports cars. Early 2011 was a time of intense pressure inside the A. T. F. The agency was under fire from Congress over the Fast and Furious operation, in which agents allowed gun traffickers to buy weapons and ship them to Mexico, hoping the shipments could lead them to major weapons dealers. Justice Department auditors began scrutinizing how A. T. F. agents managed their tobacco smuggling investigations. With that audit continuing, the A. T. F. issued new rules to tightly monitor undercover investigations. Soon after those rules went into effect, U. S. Tobacco completed its purchase of Big South for $5. 5 million, a deal that gave Big South the authority to buy and sell cigarettes on behalf of the cooperative. Almost immediately, the farmers say, Mr. Carpenter and Mr. Small began defrauding them. It worked like this: An export company working with the A. T. F. placed an order for cigarettes to be shipped internationally  —   thus not subject to American taxes. Big South would instead ship bottled water and potato chips, making it look as if cigarettes had been exported. Mr. Carpenter and Mr. Small would then buy the tobacco at a slight markup through a private bank account. Lastly, they would sell the tobacco to Big South, again at a markup. Because they had the authority to buy on behalf of the tobacco cooperative, “Carpenter and Small simply sold products to themselves,” the farmers wrote in court documents. All of these transactions occurred on paper. The cigarettes never left the Virginia warehouse. “It’s what I saw with my own eyes,” said Brandon Moore, the warehouse manager and one of the people who discussed the transactions in the case. Their accounts fit with descriptions in court records. Mr. Moore said he was aware of the A. T. F. operation but became troubled by it as he learned more. “It shouldn’t be going on, even if it is the A. T. F. ,” he said. In one deal described in the lawsuit, the informants bought tobacco at $15 a carton and sold it to U. S. Tobacco at $17. 50. The profit, about $519, 000, went into what was known as a “management account. ” That account, while controlled by Mr. Carpenter and Mr. Small, helped pay for A. T. F. investigations. Mr. Moore, the warehouse manager, said agents often told him what to buy on the company’s credit card. For instance, he recalled spending tens of thousands of dollars at Best Buy on iPads, televisions and other gifts to curry favor with potential criminal targets. Mr. Carpenter and Mr. Small have also acknowledged in court documents receiving more than $1 million each, though it is not clear from public documents whether that was profit or reimbursement for expenses paid on behalf of the government. How that arrangement began is unclear. Ryan Kaye, an A. T. F. supervisor, testified that the management account was created “as a result of verbal directives from the A. T. F. program office and other headquarters officials. ” Mr. Kaye’s full statement is sealed, but excerpts are cited in one publicly available document. The defendants in the lawsuit contend that U. S. Tobacco got a good deal on the cigarettes, even at the prices they paid. The farmers tell a different story, saying they never would have purchased Big South if they understood that Mr. Carpenter and Mr. Small had a side arrangement that involved selling them tobacco at inflated values. Thomas Lesnak, a retired A. T. F. agent who was involved in the operation, dismissed suggestions that anything was done improperly. He said he could not discuss Big South because the Justice Department was still conducting investigations based on information developed during operations based at the warehouse. The arrangement began to break down in late 2012, when Mr. Thompson joined U. S. Tobacco as the chief financial officer. He was curious why his warehouse was placing so many orders for a brand of cigarette that competes against U. S. Tobacco. He could not get a straight answer, the company said in court documents. In March 2013, Mr. Moore picked up the phone, called Mr. Thompson and explained what was happening. “I did what I did because of the ethics of it,” Mr. Moore said recently. “What was happening there was wrong. ” Once U. S. Tobacco discovered the bookkeeping irregularities, it reported them to the Justice Department, which investigates   crime and government misconduct. Records show that the Justice Department, which includes the A. T. F. investigated some aspects of the case but no charges were filed. “We voted unanimously to give everything we had to the government,” said Charlie Batten, a U. S. Tobacco board member whose family has worked the same North Carolina soil for generations. “We thought they would take it and run with it. What happened was, they’ve fought us tooth and nail. ” Because of the sealing order, Mr. Thompson, Mr. Batten and others are prohibited from discussing what happened to the money  —   even with their own farmers. Three years into its lawsuit, U. S. Tobacco still cannot disentangle itself from the government. The cooperative recently told a judge that it was under investigation by the Treasury Department. All those secret tobacco sales, it turns out, should have been taxed. And the government wants its money.	1

307	Men who exercise strenuously may have a lower libido than those whose workouts are lighter, according to one of the first studies to scientifically delve into the relationship between men’s workouts and their sex lives. For years, scientists and active people have debated whether and how exercise affects sexual desire and human reproduction. But most past studies have centered on women. Typically, this research has found that when some female athletes, such as marathon runners, train intensely for many hours a week, they can develop menstrual dysfunctions. These problems seem caused by hormonal imbalances related to physical stress and frequently affect a woman’s interest in sex and her ability to conceive. But such dysfunctions are rare and usually resolve after the athlete lightens her training load. Less is known about the effects of exercise, especially heavy exercise, on men’s libidos and fertility. There have been hints that, in moderate amounts, physical activity increases the male body’s production of the hormone testosterone, which theoretically should ramp up sex drive. Other small studies, on the other hand, have suggested that lengthy and grueling training may blunt the levels of testosterone in a man’s bloodstream both immediately and over the long term. But those studies examined only hormone changes related to exercise, which can be measured easily, and not differences in sexual emotions and behavior, which are tougher to quantify. So for the new study, which was published this month in Medicine  Science in Sports  Exercise, researchers at the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill decided to ask active men about their sex lives. They began by developing a questionnaire based on earlier psychological research into men’s sexual behavior that asked, for instance, how often they thought about and engaged in sex. The scientists also created a separate questionnaire with detailed queries about exercise habits, including how often and intensely the men worked out each week. A final set of questions asked about general health and medical histories. Then the researchers contacted running, cycling and triathlon training groups, university athletic departments, and publications targeted at endurance athletes and asked them to alert members and readers to the questionnaires, which were available online. Almost 1, 100 physically active adult men completed all of the questions. Most were experienced athletes who had participated for years in training and competitions. The scientists used their responses to stratify the men based on both the extent and intensity of their workouts. They wound up with groups whose weekly exercise was short, moderately lengthy or quite prolonged, and separately whose weekly exercise was light, moderate or extremely intense. It was possible, of course, for someone to be in the top or bottom of both of these categories, meaning that their workouts were both long and intense or light and short. But the scientists wanted to examine each of those aspects of a workout separately, so did not track such overlaps. They also categorized the men according to their answers about their sex lives, creating groups with relatively high, moderate or low libidos. Finally, they compared the men’s exercise habits to their reported interest and engagement in sex. And there were clear patterns. The men whose exercise routines were moderate or light in intensity or duration were far more likely to report moderate or high libidos than were the men whose workouts were especially prolonged or intense, even after the researchers controlled for age. (Older men tend to report less interest in sex, although not by much.) In effect, strenuous exercise “was associated with lower libido,” says Anthony Hackney, a professor of exercise physiology and nutrition at the University of North Carolina who led the study. Of course, this was a small sample of men who voluntarily chose to complete a personally intrusive survey. It is impossible to know whether they were truthful or representative of the rest of their gender. This type of study also cannot tell us whether too much exercise actually causes low libido, only that the two are linked. And it did not examine why strenuous exercise might dampen libidos. But Dr. Hackney speculates that both physical fatigue and lower testosterone levels after exhausting exercise likely play a role. He and his colleagues hope to soon mount experiments that directly track exercise, hormone levels and libidos to learn more about their interactions. They also aim to learn more about whether the intensity of the workouts or duration has the greater impact on male sex drive. Perhaps most important, he hopes eventually to pin down at what point exercise might start to lower some men’s libidos. Both moderate and light physical activity were associated in this study with relatively high libidos, he points out. “But there does seem be a potential tipping point,” after which more exercise may blunt desire. The necessary studies likely will require years and many cooperative men to complete. In the meantime, he suggests that if someone is worried about whether his training is affecting his sex life, he might try exercising a little less, to see if his libido changes. This advice could be especially important for couples trying to conceive, he says. “Fertility specialists will often ask a woman about whether and how much she exercises,” he says. “Based on our data, we think they should also be asking the man. ”	1
346	WASHINGTON  —   The homebuilders lobby fears that an ambitious rewrite of the entire tax code will stifle the housing market. Retailers fret that it will make the cost of their imports soar. For charities and their representatives, the worry is that donations will be stunted, plaguing nonprofit groups that serve the neediest Americans. President Trump’s new Treasury secretary, Steven T. Mnuchin, casually predicted this week that the first true overhaul of the federal tax code in three decades would happen before lawmakers head home for their August recess. But there’s a bit of a problem: That “swamp” Mr. Trump liked to talk about on the campaign trail? It’s still undrained. And now the dwellers of that   swamp are mobilizing to protect their patch of the bog, with armies of corporate lobbyists scrambling to protect their favorite provisions, exceptions and deductions before it is too late. To those who are in the trenches, talk of enacting sweeping tax legislation in the span of a few months sounds like a mix of bravado, naïveté and delusion. By definition, tax overhaul creates winners and losers on tax day, and with billions of dollars at stake, the prospect of revamping the system has already created fierce infighting among Republicans and a massing of lobbyist forces underwritten by a divided but   business community. “Tax reform is a series of battles,” said Sage Eastman, who worked in vain on tax overhaul plans as a longtime senior aide on the House Ways and Means Committee and who now lobbies for Mehlman Castagnetti Rosen  Thomas in Washington. “This is just the tip of the iceberg. ” The most vocal battle thus far is over the “border adjustment tax” that is the linchpin of the House Republican tax plan drafted by Speaker Paul D. Ryan and Representative Kevin Brady of Texas, the Ways and Means chairman. They have proposed a 20 percent import tax along with the elimination of taxes on exports so that, in theory, corporate tax rates could be slashed without ballooning the deficit. The plan has divided industries that have for years called for changes to the tax system, pitting retail and energy giants  —   which rely heavily on imports  —   against America’s biggest manufacturers, which hope the proposal will make their exports cheaper around the world. But the border adjustment tax is only the first fight. Tax experts are expecting a slog that could drag well into 2018 and even cast a cloud over the midterm elections. Many aspects of the House tax blueprint, the most specific plan floating around the capital, are already creating consternation across a swath of sectors that have learned over the years how to make do with the status quo, however cumbersome. With lawmakers working to put more concrete plans together quickly, these groups are pushing back before it is too late. Within the real estate industry, for instance, the concern is that a proposal to nearly double the standard deduction would reduce the tax benefits of homeownership people enjoy when they itemize their returns and deduct mortgage interest from their incomes. Reducing the appeal of this benefit, the argument goes, could weaken the housing market. “The current plan, by raising standard deduction so high, dilutes the importance of the mortgage interest deduction,” said Gerald Howard, chief executive of the National Association of Home Builders. “It really neuters it, so we’re going to try to fix that. ” Charities face a similar threat. Tax rules encouraging charitable giving have been around for ages, and they allow people to lower their tax bills and do good deeds at the same time. But, as with housing, changes to the standard deduction proposed by Republicans could erase those incentives. Last week, Michael Kenyon, chief executive of the National Association of Charitable Gift Planners, was part of a delegation of charities that came from around the country to Washington to alert members of Congress to their concerns. They held more than a hundred meetings in the capital, where they pressed for a solution that would preserve their special status. “There is real urgency about this,” Mr. Kenyon said. Anxiety is also high in corners of the moneyed financial world that have benefited mightily from the current system. Private equity has for years guarded the special treatment of “carried interest,” a loophole that lets billionaire fund managers pay low capital gains tax rates instead of higher income tax rates on the fees they charge clients. Mr. Trump, taking up a call from his predecessor, Barack Obama, campaigned to end the loophole, and because Mr. Ryan’s plan is silent on the matter, it could be in jeopardy. Another fear is the impact of a move away from the tax deduction for interest on corporate debt in favor of the immediate deductibility of business expenses. For private equity firms that rely heavily on borrowing to make deals, the shift could significantly alter the economics of many transactions by raising the cost of capital. “We are working to educate as many lawmakers as we can,” said James Maloney, vice president for public affairs at the American Investment Council, which represents the private equity industry. Both the Trump administration and Republicans in Congress have said they will need to address the repeal of the Affordable Care Act before diving into tax legislation. Separating the two, however, is not so simple. One Republican plan that has already stirred controversy would cap the amount of employee health insurance costs that employers can deduct from their corporate taxes. Republicans say the exclusion, one of the largest tax breaks in the code, limits consumer choice and ties workers too tightly to their companies, even though it is economically no different from the “Cadillac tax” on expensive health plans in the health law.   groups swiftly moved to shoot down the limit on health care deductibility when it came up this month. In a letter to Gary Cohn, director of the president’s National Economic Council, lobbyists including the American Benefits Council, the U. S. Chamber of Commerce and the American Staffing Association argued that the exclusion would represent a new tax on the middle class. And they reminded Mr. Cohn of the president’s promises to protect working class voters. “American voters want lower cost and high quality health care,” they wrote. “They do not want more taxes. ” Mr. Trump’s address to Congress on Tuesday is expected shed new light on his thinking about a comprehensive tax plan, but thus far the signals from his administration remain unclear. This week, for example, Mr. Mnuchin offered a tepid response when asked on CNBC about the border adjustment tax, offering only that “there’s some interesting aspects of it” and that it remained an option for consideration. For his part, Mr. Trump, who previously described the concept as overly complex, seemed to express more openness to it in an interview with Reuters on Thursday. “It could lead to a lot more jobs in the United States,” Mr. Trump said. “I certainly support a form of tax on the border,” he said. Regardless of Mr. Trump’s eventual position, Senate Republicans have been increasingly pessimistic about the border tax. Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, said the proposal would not win the support of 10 Republican senators, essentially declaring it dead on arrival. Even if that is overstated, Republicans will struggle to lure a sufficient number of Democrats to sign on to a tax bill. It would be a struggle just assembling the simple majority needed to make changes to the tax code through a parliamentary gambit in the budget process that would shield a tax bill from a filibuster. The forces of outside resistance, meanwhile, show no sign of letting up. The conservative advocacy and political action committee Club for Growth this week unveiled a television commercial in South Dakota to pressure Representative Kristi Noem, a Republican from that state who sits on the Ways and Means Committee, to oppose the border adjustment tax. The ad claimed that the tax would cause the prices of clothes, food and gasoline to spike. David McIntosh, the group’s president, said that he thought the fixation on an import tax was going to scuttle the chance for a big tax overhaul and that Republicans were cornering themselves by essentially advocating a tax increase. More advertisements are scheduled to be released in other Republican districts to make this case. “We’re prepared to keep going,” he said, “even if it gets to the millions. ”	1

195	As Republican lawmakers prepare to leave Washington for a weeklong congressional recess, liberal groups and Democratic Party organizers are hoping to make their homecoming as noisy and uncomfortable as possible. But national organizers concede they are playing   to a “  level” of   activism that has bubbled up from street protests and the small groups that have swelled into crowds outside local congressional offices. Protests against the Republican agenda have become routine since President Trump took office, with momentum building through widely shared videos of lawmakers being confronted by constituents angry over efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act. Now, national groups see the recess as the chance to capitalize on that local activism, with a show of might aimed at declaring the arrival of a new, and sustainable, political force  —   barely three months after their humiliating defeat in November. In email alerts, MoveOn. org is mobilizing members to attend    meetings across the country, and it has set up a website, ResistanceRecess. com, to help people find them. The site includes a guide to “health care recess messaging. ” (“The best and most impactful questions are ones where someone shares their story about what the Affordable Care Act has meant to them or their family,” it instructs.) Organizing for Action, the political nonprofit group that grew out of former President Barack Obama’s election campaign, has created a “Recess Toolkit” with suggestions on how to effectively ask questions at the events. Last week, the group held an online seminar with members of Indivisible, the most prominent activist organization to emerge in response to Mr. Trump’s election, to coach supporters on how to challenge lawmakers  —   in a “civil and respectful way” advised one strategist, according to a recording of the session. Planned Parenthood is hoping to flood the sessions with members in pink   urging Congress to keep in place the health care law and the organization’s funding. “It’s going to be intense,” said Emily Tisch Sussman, who leads the political arm of the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank in Washington. “All every group wants to know is how to find out where the town halls are going to be. ” The recess, traditionally a time for lawmakers to take the temperature of their constituents, comes at a surprisingly vulnerable moment for Republicans. They are struggling to gain traction on a legislative agenda despite controlling both congressional chambers and the White House, as the new administration remains mired in controversy over its targeted travel ban and   contact with Russia, among other issues. While complaints about the health care act  —   high premiums in particular  —   helped elect Mr. Trump, polls show it has become more popular as voters realize that repealing it would mean that an estimated 30 million people lose health insurance. There are few indications at this point that the conservative base of the Republican Party is mobilizing for action on a large scale during the recess. FreedomWorks, the   libertarian group that in 2009 nurtured Tea Party groups to rally against the legislation that became the health care act, said it was planning a Washington rally next month to let lawmakers know that there remained significant opposition to the Affordable Care Act. But just as the energy after Mr. Obama’s inauguration seemed to be on the right, this year it seems to be on the left.   demonstrations in some cities this month were met with much larger crowds of abortion rights supporters. At a widely viewed    meeting held by Representative Gus Bilirakis in Florida, a local Republican Party chairman who declared that the health care act set up “death panels” was shouted down by supporters of the law. Several Republicans, including Mr. Trump, have dismissed the   care act crowds as “paid protesters,” not constituents. Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, without offering evidence, called the protests a “very paid,   movement,” unlike the Tea Party demonstrations against the drafting of the health care law in 2009, which he characterized as “very organic. ” In fact, some of the most formidable and   organizing groups on the left have found themselves scrambling to track all of the local groups sprouting up through social media channels like Facebook and Slack, or in local “huddles” that grew out of the women’s marches across the country the day after the inauguration. “We’re just constantly being flooded with people asking us, ‘What can we do, where can we go? ’” said Ben Wikler, the Washington director of MoveOn. org, who coined the “  level” description. “For politicians to imagine that it’s something that any group could turn on and off like a light switch is a critical miscalculation. ” Ms. Sussman spent much of one morning this week communicating with 1, 600    activist groups on a Slack channel that one of them organized. “It doesn’t work for organizations to bigfoot strategy it’s not the way organizing happens now,” said Kelley Robinson, the deputy national organizing director for Planned Parenthood, which is fighting the defunding of its health clinics. “There are bigger ideas coming out of the grass roots than the traditional organizations. ” Established groups in Washington are running more traditional campaigns. The Alliance for Healthcare Security, a coalition of health care worker unions and other groups, is running television and online ads during the recess in five states where it believes Republican senators are either inclined to vote against a repeal of the Affordable Care Act, or vulnerable to defeat in   bids if they vote for repeal. The ads  —   in Alaska, Arizona, Maine, Nevada and West Virginia  —   feature constituents with   diseases telling emotional stories about how the health care law saved their lives. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee is keeping track of Republican lawmakers who do not hold    meetings. Some events have been canceled. Representative Tom MacArthur of New Jersey told voters who pressed for town halls that he was not scheduling them because they had been “hijacked” by groups hostile to Mr. Trump. The committee plans to run internet ads trying to shame lawmakers for not facing their constituents in public since voting last month on a procedural motion aimed at repealing the health law. Some of the most creative activity is coming from people who are new to political activism. In Plymouth, Minn. Kelly Guncheon, a financial planner who described himself as an independent, has organized a “With Him or Without Him” meeting for Representative Erik Paulsen, a Republican who has not scheduled any of his own. A volunteer offered to make 400 cupcakes decorated with a “Where’s Waldo?” picture of Mr. Paulsen’s face, and Mr. Guncheon said he planned to project onto screens legislation that Mr. Paulsen had supported. Participants will be asked to write down questions, which will be delivered, along with a recording of the event, to Mr. Paulsen’s congressional office after the recess. Mr. Guncheon, like other new activists, said he was not looking to traditional political groups for guidance. “In this new culture, this new era, we have to figure out new ways to do things,” he said. “There’s certainly no leadership at the head of the Democratic Party, or the state party. Not that I’m a Democrat anyway, but that seems to be the opposition party. ” Other new groups organizing on Facebook have arranged similar events, calling them “ ” or “ ” meetings, for Senators Cory Gardner of Colorado and Patrick J. Toomey of Pennsylvania, as well as for Republican lawmakers from California, New Jersey and New York. In response to Mr. Gardner’s complaints that the people showing up at his office to request    meetings were paid protesters from other states, one group showed up at his office with a banner on which members had written their Colorado ZIP codes. National groups are looking past the recess, to try to keep up the momentum for the local efforts. Ms. Sussman, at the Center for American Progress, said her group planned a training and planning session in April for new activist leaders. Save My Care, another Washington group, is to begin an online campaign on Monday where people can register to have a hospital wristband sent to their congressional representative. The wristbands, which read “I will lose my health care if you vote to repeal,” will be delivered to Congress after the recess. Planned Parenthood is signing up “defenders” and holding   training sessions to help teach new activists how to tell reporters and lawmakers their personal experiences with the group’s health services, and what it would mean to lose them. The group is planning a rally in Milwaukee on Feb. 25, the last weekend of the recess week, with Planned Parenthood patients from Speaker Paul D. Ryan’s district expected to testify how they would be affected if clinics lost funding. Mr. Ryan has said he would defund Planned Parenthood in any repeal of the Affordable Care Act. Still, said Nicole Safar, the group’s director of government relations in Wisconsin, “This is more about   than targeting Paul Ryan. ” “This is a marathon, not a sprint,” she said. “We’re going to put as much pressure as we can on Paul Ryan during the recess, for sure, but this isn’t going to end any time soon. ”	1
643	 Governor Andrew Cuomo announced Friday morning that a travel ban has been placed on 6 states in the US, citing their relaxed gun laws and potential harm to New Yorkers.The states affected by the ban include Florida, Texas, Idaho, Arizona, Utah and Vermont. That number is expected to grow as the Governor’s office continues to review gun laws across the country, to see which states would be a danger to visitors.“We see states like Florida, who have no magazine-clip capacity limit. If you’re at the beach on vacation with your family, you could have someone walking around on that very same beach who is concealing six or seven 100-round drums for his Glock … After we introduced the SAFE Act, New Yorkers had to give up any magazine-clips that held more than 10 rounds. We allowed them to be sold out of state, but then realized that all of the other states now have these dangerous magazine-clips. So, it’s best that New Yorkers simply stay in New York where everyone only has magazine-clips that hold 10 or less rounds. We don’t want to risk exposing them to the same magazine-clips that we were trying to get rid of in the first place. Now, they’re another state’s problem and not ours. Sometimes when we deem something a problem, we just hand it off to our neighbors and walk away.” [This year after posting a separate joke article], [w]e waited a few hours, because we figured that everyone would think our April Fools prank was over.

362	The most important issue for the United States economy in 2017 and beyond is whether it’s near its speed limit. It has taken eight years of glacial expansion, but the nation is closing in on what economists believe to be its full productive capacity. It’s nearing that level of activity in which nearly everybody who wants a job has one, and factories and offices are cranking at full speed. If the economy grows just 2. 5 percent this year, gross domestic product will reach the Congressional Budget Office’s estimate of the nation’s economic potential by the end of the year. If the Trump administration succeeds at achieving the 4 percent growth the president has said he seeks, we’ll be there by the Fourth of July. If there is in fact more room to grow beyond the budget office’s estimate of “potential G. D. P. ,” an economic boom remains possible. If there isn’t, higher growth will translate into inflation, not higher output and incomes. The question for the Trump administration, the Federal Reserve and every American who wants a higher paycheck is how much slack there really is in the economy. Economic slack takes the form of empty warehouses and office parks of machines that run eight hours a day when they were built to run for 12 and, most important, millions of Americans who might be coaxed to work in a booming economy but who aren’t even looking for a job now. If there is a lot of slack, then the Trump administration’s ambitious growth targets look more plausible, and the Fed should move slowly on raising interest rates so as not to choke off the expansion just as it’s getting going. If there’s not very much  —   if this is about the best the nation can expect to do  —   then either the Fed will raise rates more quickly to choke off growth or inflation will burst higher, or both. Astronomers can’t observe a black hole directly they can determine where one is only by measuring how it affects nearby matter. Potential output is similar. For all the apparent precision of reports from government agencies, potential G. D. P. isn’t something that can be directly measured. It’s a judgment based on other evidence. How big is the population of prime   people, and how many of them would be expected to seek work? How low in the past has unemployment gone before inflation became a problem? What is the recent record of productivity growth? In assessing how close we are (or aren’t) to full capacity, it helps to look at America’s industrial parks and office complexes. The Federal Reserve watches the industrial sector by measuring what is called factory capacity utilization. American companies were operating factories at 75. 7 percent of their potential in January. That’s roughly the rate they’ve been at for the last five years. Experience suggests it could go higher. In the spring of 2007, the rate was 79. 5 percent. It was above 80 percent for the better part of the 1990s. In other words, the manufacturing sector would seem to have room to produce more stuff even without expanding factory floors or adding equipment. At Caterpillar, the giant maker of heavy equipment based in Peoria, Ill. Jim Umpleby, the chief executive, told analysts last month that, even as it closely managed costs, “we’re also preserving capacity for a potential increase in business whenever that comes. ” Economic slack is trickier to measure in the service sector good luck judging whether, say, an insurance company is operating below or at its full potential. But one window into it is the office vacancy rate. Nationwide, 15. 8 percent of office space was vacant in the final months of 2016, according to the real estate information firm Reis. That was down from a recent high of 17. 6 percent in 2011  —   but could still have room to fall. In the last expansion, it fell as low as 12. 5 percent, implying that millions of square feet of offices are sitting idle, ready for   workers to fill them. “Vacancy has fallen, but there are still some large blocks of space out there,” said John Ferguson, president of the Southeast division of the commercial real estate firm CBRE. “A tenant can typically find a   solution if they need to, even if it’s not perfect for the long term. ” One thing to keep an eye on: Development of new office space has been relatively depressed since the 2008 recession, which raises the possibility that the remaining vacant space could be filled up quickly with little new supply arriving to fulfill the demand. Mr. Ferguson sees it in Atlanta, where he is based, and in other Southern cities like Nashville and Charlotte, N. C. “In the last cycle 10 years ago, there were six new office towers added in Buckhead,” Mr. Ferguson said, referring to an affluent Atlanta neighborhood. “In this cycle, there’s one. ” The biggest factor that will determine how much room the United States economy has to grow is the supply of workers. The unemployment rate is the most common measure of slack in the labor market, and it suggests that full employment has very nearly arrived: The 4. 8 percent unemployment rate is roughly what Fed officials believe is the   rate that won’t provoke inflation, and not far from the 4. 4 percent low in the last expansion. But there are important wrinkles. Millions of Americans left the labor force entirely in the aftermath of the last recession. And there are “missing” workers, people who do not count as unemployed because they are not looking for a job but might be available to work  —   and contribute to G. D. P.  —   if things were rosier. To people who work on employment issues, there is both good news and bad. “A third to a half of the people on the sidelines, it wouldn’t take much to employ tomorrow,” said Stefani Pashman, chief executive of Partner4Work, a work force development group in the Pittsburgh area. “The other half are much tougher to employ,” often facing challenges from drug use, criminal records and transience. That would seem to support the idea that there are meaningful numbers of   workers out there  —   but not an unlimited number. The Economic Policy Institute calculates that there are 1. 85 million missing workers. In all these areas, the evidence points to an economy not being quite on the verge of overheating, but also not offering huge potential for growth. Perhaps the best argument for policy makers to be cautious about putting the brakes on economic growth with rapid Fed interest rate increases is how much we don’t know about why growth has been so disappointing over the past several years. Here’s a weighty fact: In 2007, the Congressional Budget Office published   projections of potential G. D. P. that assumed the United States would grow around 2. 7 percent a year for the ensuing decade. It didn’t. Growth in both the labor force and worker productivity underperformed those projections. So the reality we’re living in underperforms that theoretical potential by $2. 2 trillion, or 14 percent. One possibility of what went wrong is that the damage of the deep 2008 recession had lasting effects, both pulling some Americans out of the work force and causing businesses to underinvest in innovations. Weak demand for goods and services damaged the capacity of the economy, producing a vicious cycle. If officials at the Fed and in the Trump administration try to run the economy a little hot  —   to keep pursuing faster growth even as the economy gets close to or above potential G. D. P.  —   it would be a chance to do the reverse, to create a virtuous cycle. Trying it carries risks of its own  —   of inflation, and perhaps new financial bubbles. The alternative is to take the   world we’ve been living in as an immutable fact of life, and get used to it.	1

While the sharp incline of the death rate of white males is a good start, the solution to the ‘white question’ will not be reached until there is a sharp decline in the population of white females as well. Much more needs to be done in this regard if this country is ever to advance from its ignorant backwardness towards being an actually inhabitable nation.Thankfully, the Prophet Muhammad has given us a foolproof way to speed up the decline of a vanquished nation by treating their women as our sex slaves.

We may yet see some final convulsions before white Middle America is decreased to a manageable number where it can be more easily controlled.”The blog post was removed from Zakaria’s blog within a few hours, after it began to receive negative attention.	0
8	The New York Police Department on Wednesday announced plans to send 75 new investigators to the Bronx to address a steep and longstanding shortage of detectives in the department’s most violent and underserved borough. The chief of detectives, Robert K. Boyce, told city lawmakers at a hearing that the influx was aimed at easing enormous caseloads, which retired police leaders say have hindered investigative work in the Bronx for decades. Homicides in New York City have been falling, but the department’s plans for the Bronx reflect a growing recognition by police chiefs in cities experiencing upticks in murder that heavy caseloads let crimes go unsolved and feed a cycle of street violence. The plan for the infusion of resources comes five weeks after The New York Times published an analysis of confidential deployment data showing that precinct detectives in the Bronx last year carried more than twice as many violent felony cases on average as detectives in Manhattan or on Staten Island, and over 50 percent more than those in Brooklyn or Queens. The new deployment is a significant investment in   investigative work for parts of the Bronx that have not experienced the same improvements in overall crime rates in recent decades as wealthier parts of the city, especially at a time when detective resources are increasingly pulled toward counterterrorism operations. Department leaders, who for years have kept deployment information under wraps even amid major budgetary decisions, acknowledged in frank terms on Wednesday that parts of the city remained in need. “We saw that some of the detective squads up there are more than just a little bit challenged,” Chief Boyce said of the Bronx. “They’re flooded with more cases than they were last year. ” Police supervisors in the Bronx embraced the news of the reinforcements, known as   investigators, a class of officers who are training to become   detectives. Working under experienced detectives, the investigators often shoulder the more   tasks, like canvassing buildings for witnesses and searching for video. After 18 months, they become eligible to be promoted to detectives. “It’s great, this new wave of young, inspired police officers who want to be detectives,” said a   commander in the Bronx who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk about departmental deployment decisions. “Not only are you building the present, but you are building the future,” the commander added. “And it is good for the Bronx. ” The Times’s deployment analysis grew out of a series of articles about murder in the 40th Precinct, a    section of the South Bronx where three detectives last year carried more than 400 cases and many others had loads in the high 300s, markedly more than the 150 cases per year the department recommends for precincts with high rates of violent crime. Chief Boyce said Wednesday that about 40 of the city’s 77 precincts needed additional help to meet caseload goals. In the Bronx, he said, the 40th and the 47th, covering Wakefield and Williamsbridge, were especially burdened, some of that owing to increases in crime there last year. The department has already identified and interviewed the 75 new investigators and will send them to squads by the end of the month, Chief Boyce said. Six of them will be sent to the 40th Precinct, in addition to three detectives and one investigator added in   giving the squad a total of 33 detectives and investigators. The Times analysis last year focused on detectives and deliberately excluded   investigators because they are in training and primarily act in support roles. Police officials and elected leaders said that adding   investigators, although not as quick a fix as transferring detectives from one precinct to another, was more politically palatable and would have a lasting impact. The investigators, once promoted, typically stay in the same precinct squads where they were trained. The district attorney in the Bronx, Darcel D. Clark, said she was “very pleased” with the plan. “The people of the Bronx have been underserved too long,” Ms. Clark said. After the publication of the Times article in December, she said, she asked her office’s bureau chiefs to submit ideas for addressing the paucity in investigative resources and pressed Chief Boyce to add detectives. Ms. Clark worried that the understaffing scared off witnesses  —   who did not believe the police could protect them  —   from testifying. Michael J. Palladino, the head of the union representing New York City’s 5, 500 detectives, said that even 75 new investigators was only a first step. “Chief Boyce would like nothing more than to have a few hundred extra white shields for assignment to Bronx detective squads, but budget constraints prevent that,” Mr. Palladino said. “Getting its complement of the allotment will help the 40th Detective Squad, but historically speaking, that precinct seems resistant to crime strategies. ” Chief Boyce characterized the influx to the Bronx as a specific response to high crime and caseloads there, not as a way to fill a gap because of attrition or routine transfers. Other cities, like Boston, have improved their arrest rates by adding detectives and augmenting them with more civilian crime analysts. New York City’s Independent Budget Office has pointed out recently that the department has left empty jobs that were authorized for civilians and kept   officers in other jobs that were fit for civilians, effectively tying up officers who could otherwise do   or investigative work. Elected leaders and watchdogs have struggled to gain a clear understanding of the Police Department’s staffing and the decision making behind deployment practices. Many said Wednesday’s hearing was the first time they got specific answers, and they vowed to pursue legislation to require the department to regularly report staffing and arrest rates. “Clearly this is a backhanded acknowledgment that a problem existed,” said the city’s public advocate, Letitia James. She said the department needed to focus more on “open cases in our underserved communities,” especially in the Brownsville and East New York neighborhoods of Brooklyn and the South Bronx. “It should not have taken investigations done by others to reveal inequities in police resources,” Ms. James said. Vanessa Gibson, a City Council member from the Bronx who presided over Wednesday’s hearing, said that Bronx cases were especially difficult to solve because of drug and gang ties and that, as a result, “sometimes it’s hard to attract detectives in the Bronx. ” Jumaane Williams, a council member from Brooklyn, said that for several years he had been seeking data on the size of boroughwide homicide squads, which often work with precinct squads on   homicides, and that he had not gotten direct answers until Wednesday. Chief Boyce said the Bronx had fewer homicide detectives than Manhattan or Queens despite having more than twice as many murders as either borough, although he said Manhattan detectives also worked on nonfatal shootings.	1

285	IZMIR, Turkey  —   Turkish officials handed down punishments on Tuesday to two leaders of a major opposition party who have become casualties of a   crackdown on dissent that escalated after a failed coup  in July.  Selahattin Demirtas, a leader of the   Peoples’ Democratic Party, was sentenced on Tuesday to five months in jail for insulting the Turkish state, the Turkish nation and their institutions. Hours earlier, Figen Yuksekdag, the other leader of the party, was expelled from Parliament after the country’s top court upheld her conviction for a terrorism offense. Both have been in custody since being detained in raids in November. Thousands of members of their party, known as the H. D. P. have also been arrested since the breakdown of Kurdish peace talks in 2015, including at least a dozen of their 59 members of Parliament. The arrests of party members accelerated after the failed coup, which also set off an even larger purge of government officials and people suspected of being dissidents. More than 45, 000 government officials, soldiers, police officers, teachers and journalists have been arrested since the coup attempt, most of them suspected of having connections to the Gulenist movement, a group led by Fethullah Gulen, an exiled cleric living in the United States, that Turkey believes was behind the attempted putsch. The government accuses the H. D. P. of links to a Kurdish militia that has been designated a terrorist group by Turkey, NATO and the European Union. But on Tuesday, the H. D. P. said it was being targeted as part of a wider crackdown on political opposition ahead of a controversial April referendum in which President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is encouraging Turks to grant him greater executive powers. “It is totally about the referendum,” Hisyar Ozsoy, an H. D. P. member of Parliament, said by telephone on Tuesday. “He’s committed to paralyzing the H. D. P. organizationally so that we can’t carry out an effective ‘no’ campaign. ” The H. D. P. Turkey’s   party, received just over 10 percent of the vote in the most recent parliamentary elections, but its leaders believe its supporters could make the difference in a close vote on the referendum. A charismatic leader, Mr. Demirtas had widened the party’s appeal beyond its Kurdish base before the crackdown intensified. Mr. Erdogan’s opponents say that a victory for him in the referendum would lead to   rule, while his supporters argue that it would merely create a United   presidency and bring stability to Turkey. The Turkish news media has reported that the government is worried enough about a victory for the “no” campaign that officials in Konya, a city in central Turkey, recently withdrew from circulation an antismoking pamphlet that contained the word “no. ” A local member of Parliament there from Turkey’s governing party said the pamphlets had been recalled to avoid “confusion,” the Turkish newspaper Hurriyet Daily News reported. Mr. Erdogan has previously told reporters “those who say no will be siding with July 15,” referring to the date of the coup attempt. Andrew Gardner, the Turkey researcher for Amnesty International, said, “It’s hard to imagine how the situation could get any worse in the   to the April referendum. ”	1

Although occasionally twinned with Eeyore the donkey or Owl, A A Milne’s bear spends most of his time rescuing the pig from fixes.“It could be that we are unable to divorce Winnie the Pooh from Piglet,” said a Mothercare spokeswoman, whose colleagues in West Yorkshire have been keen to find a solution. Staff at one branch said that mothers had been coming back, slightly embarrassed, and asking if Piglet-free products were available, but “it had taken a bit of time for the penny to drop.”Nissar Ahmed from the Leeds Muslim community said that most pictures in a Muslim house would have a religious significance. He said: “I would think that no Muslim would want pictures of pigs, even the harmless character Piglet.”	0

259	WASHINGTON  —   As he met with Neil M. Gorsuch in the Capitol last week, Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois posed to the Supreme Court nominee what he considered a fairly basic question on the relationship between the executive and judicial branches. “He really backed away from it,” recalled Mr. Durbin, an influential Democratic voice on judicial issues with long service on the Judiciary Committee. “Even in the most general constitutional terms, he didn’t want to discuss it. From where I am sitting I don’t think there is a more important question in light of this president. ” Democrats preparing for hearings next month on President Trump’s first nominee to the nation’s highest court say it is not a matter of getting the answers they want from Judge Gorsuch it is a matter of getting any pertinent answers at all. “He refused to say anything about potentially relevant questions,” said Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat and former state attorney general who also sits on the panel that will consider the nomination. The test of wills promises to provide friction at hearings scheduled to begin on March 20 as Democrats try to pin down Judge Gorsuch on what he sees as the role of an independent judiciary in constraining the executive branch, given their rising fears about Mr. Trump. It is also the latest match in the longstanding    over how far judicial nominees should or should not go in responding to questions from lawmakers. Given fierce partisan tension over Supreme Court seats, it has become an uncomfortable norm for nominees to avoid providing bountiful answers both in private interviews and during the confirmation hearing. They lean heavily on the excuse that the issue could end up before the court and they would hate to prejudge it. In the current environment, the view is clearly the less said, the better the chances of confirmation. “Everyone knows you are going to ask your best question and they are not going to answer it,” said Senator Mitch McConnell, the Kentucky Republican and majority leader, of the difficulty of inducing a nominee to say something truly revealing. No one expects a nominee like Judge Gorsuch to address how he would rule on a specific case  —   like President Trump’s contested immigration order  —   or offer a detailed view on federal policy likely to land before the court. But Democrats say that Judge Gorsuch must be willing to discuss the merits of past Supreme Court decisions as well as his judicial principles and philosophy if they are to make a judgment on his fitness. “It’s always important for a Supreme Court nominee to tell senators his or her views on the Constitution, but given how aggressively this president is testing the Constitution so early in his term, senators deserve those answers more than ever,” said Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader. Lawmakers say that Mr. Gorsuch assured them during their meetings that no one in the Trump White House had asked him how he would rule in specific cases. But Democrats note that his nomination was promoted by leading conservative groups such as the Federalist Society and the Heritage Foundation. In the absence of information to the contrary from him, they say they will have to assume he shares the views of those groups on such issues as abortion and gun rights. “His refusal to answer these questions leaves us with the inescapable conclusion that he has passed the Trump litmus test,” said Mr. Blumenthal, who, like other lawmakers, found Judge Gorsuch personable and impressively prepared. For their part, Republicans have voiced nothing but praise for the nominee. “I met with Judge Gorsuch for more than an hour and was tremendously impressed with his intellect, his humility and his respect for the rule of law,” said Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine. She said they had an extended discussion about precedent and that Mr. Gorsuch said he believed that “it is not sufficient to overturn a   precedent for five current judges to believe a previous decision was wrongly decided. ” That position could be interpreted by lawmakers who support abortion rights, like Ms. Collins, to mean he would not overturn Roe v. Wade even if he were part of a majority that disagreed with it. Kelly Ayotte, the former New Hampshire senator who is serving as Judge Gorsuch’s sherpa through the Senate process, said she found him quite forthcoming during the 58 meetings with lawmakers she attended and added that he talked at length about his rulings on the United States Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit. “He’s obviously saying as much as he can without violating his responsibility as a judge not to offer opinions on cases that may come before the court,” she said. In trying to forestall Democratic complaints that Judge Gorsuch has not been sufficiently revealing, Mr. McConnell has reminded Democrats of the “Ginsburg standard”  —   a reference to Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s repeated refusal at her hearing in 1993 to answer many direct questions on the grounds she could not “preview or forecast” her decisions. But Republicans had their own differences in the past with the reluctance of nominees to be direct. Senator Charles E. Grassley, the Iowa Republican who now heads the Judiciary Committee, opposed the nomination of Elena Kagan in 2010, saying she failed to provide candid answers. One contemporary nominee did pride himself on his ability to take on members of the Judiciary Committee in a full exchange of views. Judge Robert Bork answered nearly every question from senators over five days of testimony in 1987. At the time, Senator Arlen Specter, Republican of Pennsylvania, said he hoped Mr. Bork’s willingness to engage would “set a pattern for the future. ” It did. After Mr. Bork’s nomination was famously defeated, nominees have been very stingy with their answers to avoid blowing up their chances of success.	1
179	Over the last decade, new cars have gotten electronic stability control systems to prevent skids, rearview cameras to prevent fender benders and more airbags to protect occupants in collisions. Hundreds of millions of dollars have been spent on campaigns to remind the public of the dangers of drunken driving, failing to buckle up and texting while on the go. Despite all that, more Americans are dying on roads and highways than in years, and the sudden and sharp increase has alarmed safety advocates. The latest batch of bad news arrived Wednesday in traffic fatality estimates released by the National Safety Council, a nonprofit organization that works closely with federal   regulators. According to its estimates, 40, 200 people died in accidents involving motor vehicles in 2016, a 6 percent rise from the year before. If the estimates are confirmed, it will be the first time since 2007 that more than 40, 000 people have died in motor vehicle accidents in a single year. The 2016 total comes after a 7 percent rise in 2015 and means the   increase  —   14 percent  —   is the largest in more than a half a century. “Why are we O. K. with this?” Deborah Hersman, the National Safety Council president and chief executive, said at a news conference. “Complacency is killing us. ” Part of the increase is believed to stem from the improving economy, which has led Americans to drive more miles for both work and pleasure. But safety advocates say that explains only part of the trend because the number of deaths as a percentage of miles driven is also increasing. They also point to data suggesting an increase in distracted driving. While cars and phones now offer advanced voice controls and other features intended to keep drivers’ eyes on the road, apps like Facebook, Google Maps, Snapchat and others have created new temptations that drivers and passengers find hard to resist. “It’s not just talking on the phone that’s a problem today,” said Jonathan Adkins, executive director of the Governors Highway Safety Association. “You now have all these other apps that people can use on their phones. ” Government officials and safety advocates contend, however, that more than anything else, the increase in deaths has been caused by more lenient enforcement of seatbelt, drunken driving and speeding regulations by authorities and a reluctance by lawmakers to pass more restrictive measures. A patchwork of state laws leaves many areas where drivers can choose not to buckle up, with little likelihood of being stopped. Only 18 states have laws requiring seatbelts for both front and rear occupants and categorize not wearing them as a primary offense  —   meaning drivers can be pulled over for that alone. In 15 states, failure to wear a seatbelt in front seats is only a secondary offense  —   drivers cannot be given tickets unless they are pulled over for other violations. “It’s still the same things that are killing drivers  —   belts, booze and speed,” Mr. Adkins said. About half of all traffic fatalities involve unbelted occupants, and almost a third involve drivers who were impaired by drugs or alcohol, according to data from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the federal government’s main   agency. In Alabama, steady budget cuts have resulted in a decline in the number of troopers patrolling the state’s 103, 000 miles of highways. David Brown, a research associate at the University of Alabama’s Center for Advanced Public Safety, studied the state’s 2016 traffic fatality reports and found an increase in fatalities involving   crashes. “Total crashes were up less than 5 percent, but fatalities were up 25 percent,” he said in an interview. “I think speeding is the No. 1 problem. There are times of the day when we only have one or two troopers on duty in a county, so you can speed, and there’s no one there to deter it. ” In some states, highway speed limits are rising. In recent years, Texas has increased speed limits to 85 miles per hour in some rural areas. About 1, 500 miles of roads have a limit of 75 miles per hour or higher. In the fall, the N. H. T. S. A. the National Transportation Safety Board and several nongovernmental organizations, including the National Safety Council, began the Road to Zero initiative to eliminate traffic fatalities within 30 years. The effort places heavy emphasis on the promise of autonomous vehicles. But others say that more needs to be done now on basic road safety issues. “The way to bring down the rise in deaths is with a wide range of the    measures, not   cars,” the consumer advocate Ralph Nader said in an interview in October. Mr. Nader said states could reduce traffic deaths simply by requiring   occupants to wear seatbelts, installing more cameras to catch speeding drivers without a police presence and tightening regulations on heavy trucking. In presenting its 2016 fatality estimates, the National Safety Council endorsed those ideas and also called for bans on all use of smartphones by drivers, even if they use   calling or messaging. The council is also advocating mandatory motorcycle helmet laws and ignition locks that prevent repeat drunken drivers from operating their vehicles while impaired. The safety council’s figures typically correspond closely to the fatality totals that the N. H. T. S. A. compiles, but they include accidents off public roads and deaths occurring over a longer period after a crash.	1
78	The music producer Malay won a Grammy Award in 2013 for his work on Frank Ocean’s album “Channel Orange. ” Since then, he has kept busy with multiple projects, including producing albums for Sam Smith and Zayn Malik. This means he is in the studio seven days a week and rarely gets a “full day off,” he said. Still, Malay (pronounced  ) 38, whose real name is James Ryan Ho, fits in some downtime on Sundays to connect with his wife, Iris Belson, 30, a singer, and to indulge in some cooking. They live in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, with their dogs,   5, a Shih Tzu, and Coco, 3, a Maltese Yorkie. NOCTURNAL The earliest I wake up is 10, though sometimes it’s 11. I am a nocturnal person and like to work late, but even if I’m not working, it takes me a few hours to wind down from the day, and I usually go to bed between 4 and 5. Fortunately, Iris has the same schedule. GRAB THE LEASHES   and Coco are antsy to get out when we’re up, so before anything else, we throw on gym clothes and take them for a walk along the Brooklyn waterfront, which is right by our apartment. COLD BREW One the way home, we stop at a sandwich shop on Wythe Avenue called Dépanneur to get our coffee fix. They sell this great Brooklyn brand called Toby’s Estate, and even if it’s freezing outside, Iris and I both order the cold brew. SWEAT IT OUT With our coffee buzz on, we head to the gym in our apartment building for a quick workout. Our Saturday nights are typically   and I like to do an intense cardio to ward off the effects. Normally, it’s a sprint on the treadmill or 30 minutes of jump rope.   BRUNCH I am really into cooking. My family is from Malaysia originally, and in our culture, kids learn basic kitchen skills like chopping as well as cooking at a young age at home by helping their families. Back then, it was a chore, but now I love experimenting with new recipes, especially for Sunday brunches. I just got a Smoking Gun to smoke foods, and I’m using it on egg dishes. The last thing I made was a lobster eggs Benedict that was smoked. I made the hollandaise sauce from scratch. We both try to eat healthy and follow a paleo diet with low carbs but love good food. MAKING MUSIC Normally after brunch, I Juno it to Manhattan to Germano Studios in the Village where I tend to my various projects. Besides Sam Smith and Zayn, I’m working with this      singer from Portland, Aminé, who has a popular song out right now called “Caroline. ” And, I am also working on my own album, which is a collaboration of songs with many of the artists I have worked with. COCKTAIL HOUR My usual workdays average between 10 to 16 hours, but I try to limit myself to five hours on a Sunday. Around 10, Iris and I meet up at Soho House in the meatpacking district or at the newer one on Ludlow Street. We start off by having a drink or two. Without fail, Iris gets the Eastern Standard, this cucumber vodka mint cocktail. For me, it’s either Japanese whiskey or a nice Brunello from Italy. FEAST After I’ve unwound a bit from my afternoon of work, we order dinner. If we’re at Ludlow House, we like their restaurant Ducked Up where they have the best Peking duck I have ever eaten. It comes with pancakes, and we order sides like baby kale salad, roasted carrots and kimchi fried rice. KITCHEN PREP When we’re back in Williamsburg, which is usually by midnight, I spend an hour or so in the kitchen cooking food for the week ahead. I do a big batch of roasted chicken breast, maybe some braised beef, steamed broccoli with garlic and lemon, and roasted cauliflower. CUDDLE UP Iris, the dogs and I get into bed and cuddle up to catch up on all the Netflix series we’re into like “The Get Down,” Baz Luhrmann’s show about musicians in the South Bronx in the 1970s. We also like “Stranger Things” and “House of Cards. ” We’ll watch for a few hours until we all eventually fall asleep.	1
615	 Newark mother arrested for raping her 2 year old son with a vibrator resulting in his death.Shakeda Brown, 25, of Newark, New Jersey, pled not guilty to charges of sexual misconduct with a minor and child abuse after a vibrator she allegedly shoved into her 2-year-old son’s rectum had to be surgically removed, later resulting in the child’s death.Doctors also discovered an object lodged in his rectum, which appears to be a vibrator or some other sex toy. According to reports, it appeared as if the injuries around the toddler’s anus were from his mother using her finger or another object in an attempt to remove the vibrator, but he eventually had to undergo surgery.Authorities further questioned Brown which lead to the discovery of Brown’s involvement in the child’s injuries. According to authorities, Brown provided the following explanation regarding the incident:“I got tired of him crying when I was trying to have sex with my boyfriend. I changed him, fed him, and burped him but he kept crying. I didn’t have sex in over 3 days so I was really horny. When me and my boyfriend were trying to do it, my son kept crying so I put one of my toys in his butt to keep him quiet. I didn’t realize it would cause this much damage to him, I just wanted him to stop crying so I could have sex,” said Brown to authorities.	0
397	Bill Paxton, the affable actor who was a   in a string of 1990s blockbuster movies including “Twister,” “Titanic” and “Apollo 13,” and who later played the lead in the critically acclaimed television drama “Big Love,” has died. He was 61. His death, from complications of surgery, was announced on Sunday by a family representative. The statement did not say when or where Mr. Paxton died, but Rolling Stone magazine reported that he died on Saturday. Early in his career, Mr. Paxton had small parts in “The Terminator” (1984) and “Aliens” (1986). Both films were directed by James Cameron, who later featured him in more   roles: as a   salesman who cheated Jamie Lee Curtis’s character in “True Lies” (1994) and as the   scientist who salvaged the wreck of the ocean liner in “Titanic” (1997). He also starred in Ron Howard’s   film “Apollo 13” (1995) portraying Fred Haise, one of three astronauts on a mission to the moon that experienced serious mechanical problems, and in “Twister” (1996) as a  . Mr. Paxton appeared regularly on television in the last decade. On the HBO series “Big Love,” from 2006 to 2011, he played Bill Henrickson, the patriarch of a polygamist family in Utah, receiving three Golden Globe nominations for his portrayal. In 2012, he was nominated for an Emmy Award for playing Randolph McCoy in the     “Hatfields  McCoys” on the History Channel. And in 2014 he appeared in six episodes of “Marvel’s Agents of S. H. I. E. L. D. ” on ABC. Mr. Paxton returned to TV this year as the star of “Training Day,” CBS’s new police drama. A spinoff of the 2001 movie starring Denzel Washington, the series had its premiere this month, and only four episodes have been broadcast. In total, 13 episodes of “Training Day” have been filmed, and Mr. Paxton appears in all of them. For now, the show will continue to be shown on Thursday nights, but its future is not certain. Reviews have been mixed  —   though Mr. Paxton’s performance as a rogue cop has been praised  —   and its ratings have been low, averaging little more than four million viewers. In a statement, CBS and Warner Bros. Television offered no word on the show’s future. William Paxton was born on May 17, 1955, in Fort Worth, the son of the former Mary Lou Gray and John Lane Paxton, a businessman and sometime actor. When he was 8, Bill and his brother, Bob, were taken by their father to see President John F. Kennedy on the morning of Nov. 22, 1963, in Fort Worth, hours before his assassination in Dallas. “I remember just a really euphoric crowd,” he recalled in a 2013 interview. “I was a bit young to really understand later the consequences of the event. ” There is a photograph of Mr. Paxton from that morning, perched on a stranger’s shoulders. He graduated from Arlington Heights High School in Fort Worth and moved to Los Angeles the next year to break into the film industry, finding jobs as a production assistant and set dresser. At 21 he enrolled in New York University, where he studied with the acting teacher Stella Adler, but dropped out after two years to return to Los Angeles to pursue acting there. “I didn’t see any point in a degree,” he told Texas Monthly. “I didn’t see where I’d be filling that in on an application for any kind of job. ” Mr. Paxton’s survivors include his wife of more than 30 years, Louise Newbury and two children, James and Lydia. Long before his role in “Big Love,’’ Mr. Paxton was   in assessing his status in Hollywood. “It’s always a little frustrating when you’re reading a script after 10 guys ahead of you have had a chance to pick it over,” he said in 1998. “You can almost see the bread crumbs. I haven’t had a role that’s propelled me into major stardom. Sure, I’ve had roles that put me on the playing field. A lot of base hits. No home runs. ”	1
11	MOSCOW  —   All died far from the front lines in circumstances unrelated to military action. They died in elaborate ambushes, car bomb attacks and, in one case, a   elevator. The latest died on Wednesday in an explosion in his office. The staccato of about half a dozen assassinations of commanders in the   separatist army in eastern Ukraine has become one of the riddles of the war there since 2015, when the first unexplained killings of Cossack militia leaders occurred. Ukrainian officials have denied any involvement in the killings, while welcoming them for thinning the ranks of the breakaway military. The authorities in Kiev say the deaths point to either infighting in the separatist leadership or efforts by Russia to consolidate control by eliminating erratic, if popular, local commanders on their own side. The assassinations could ease peace talks Ukraine had refused direct negotiations with the rebel leadership as long as men it deemed war criminals held senior posts. Rebel officials blamed Ukraine for the latest death, of Mikhail Tolstykh, best known by his nom de guerre, Givi. The Kremlin spokesman, Dmitri S. Peskov, denied any Russian role. Mr. Tolstykh died early Wednesday when a rocket was fired from a portable launcher into the window of his office, a separatist news agency reported. The blast blew out windows and started a fire. A Ukrainian military spokesman, Aleksandr Motuzyanik, suggested to journalists in Kiev that Mr. Tolstykh’s own soldiers might be to blame in a   fragging episode, or the killing of an officer. His unit, Mr. Motuzyanik said, suffered heavy losses in a recent   of fighting near the town of Avdiivka, creating “many enemies and  . ” The other victims of the assassinations include Arsen Pavlov, who went by the nickname Motorola and was killed in the elevator bombing Aleksei Mozgovoy, a former restaurant cook turned commander of a unit called the Ghost Brigade and Aleksandr Bednov, who went by the nickname Batman. The European Union placed Mr. Pavlov, a Russian citizen, on sanctions lists after he boasted in an interview of shooting 15 Ukrainian soldiers who were taken prisoner during the fight for the Donetsk city airport in 2015. Mr. Tolstykh also played a prominent role in that battle and appeared in a video forcing kneeling, captured Ukrainian soldiers to eat the cloth Ukrainian flag insignia from their uniforms. The assassinations have caused enough worry among rebel commanders that a year ago Aleksandr Khodakovsky, leader of the Vostok battalion, insinuated a Russian role in a post on the social network LiveJournal. “I ask you again,” he wrote in a sarcastic letter addressed to Russian authorities that noted the car bombings and machine gun bursts in earlier attacks, “if it comes to taking measures against me, try to do it in a way that others don’t suffer. ”	1

101	What does it really mean to “dress like a woman”? Social media recently took it upon itself to answer that question, after a brief flurry of rumors about a possible White House dress code. At the Grammys, so did Beyoncé, who apparently decided it meant looking like the golden goddess of fecundity. Now designers are having their turn. It is, after all, a question that lies at the heart of fashion, and that they, at least theoretically, are supposed to be asking themselves every season. Of course, that doesn’t mean they always come up with viable answers. Indeed, during New York Fashion Week shows on Sunday, they sometimes seemed to get so entangled in the many possible responses that they tripped over their own hemlines. Or, in the case of Sander Lak at Sies Marjan, the many fluttery bits that dangled, flapped, ruffled and wobbled in his painterly procession of aubergine, peach, mint green and fluorescent pink. Even with some sporty snaps to ground them, his dresses (and sleeves and trousers) looked as if they’d taken a wrong turn on the way to a Martha Graham dance performance and ended up in the ballroom of the Sixth Avenue Hilton by mistake. Prabal Gurung, however, seemed to know exactly where he was going: toward “multiple ways to celebrate the exuberance of being a woman and to interpret her femininity as she sees fit,” according to the show notes. That’s kind of broad territory. Witness giant nubby, braided and tufted Nepalese knits in wool and cashmere with fox trim. Sleek camo intarsia mink furs in lemon, olive green and white, made for a Park Avenue warrior. Silver devoré shirting and flared trousers fit for a glam rock star. And sheer   evening gowns with    bra tops for  —   well, it wasn’t entirely clear for whom. Someone who does a lot of Soul Cycle, maybe. And a finale of   personalized for each model (including those of welcomely nontraditional runway size) and bearing such messages as “The Future is Female,” “My boyfriend is a feminist,” “I am an immigrant,” and so on. By the time Mr. Gurung appeared for his bow, wearing one of his own tees  —   “This is what a feminist looks like”  —   his celebrity front row (the most diverse yet for any designer, with Misty Copeland, Sarah Jessica Parker, Huma Abedin, Priyanka Chopra and Diane Kruger, among others) were on their feet in ecstasy. Yet with the myriad possibilities, it was also a bit of a muddle. It’s not enough to be inspired by all women, lovely as that sentiment is: Designers also have to know what they stands for  —   the specific thing they offer women  —   and to make aesthetic choices. While some of Mr. Gurung’s were great (those knits!) some were cloying (a     dress dripping with plissé at the sleeves and a host of covered buttons down the skirt) and some were just plain silly. Dressing like a woman does not mean putting the breasts front and center via an entirely sheer Lurex turtleneck, the    movement aside. Whether it instead means dressing in the   gray flannel cape of a renaissance prince, on the other hand, as Joseph Altuzarra seemed to think it does, is far from certain. In an   from last season’s flirtatious romp through the Côte d’Azur, for fall, Mr. Altuzarra took a decidedly more   and historicist turn in black velvet and ruby jacquard. Wool coats were finished in elaborate frogging and big pearl buttons, leather combat boots studded with pearls were laced up to   and they were echoed by corset lacing at the waists of     jersey dresses. Big fur pockets were belted atop little velvet dresses with white poplin collars. Aside from some   leather motorcycle pants worn with a houndstooth blazer, it tipped a bit too far into Shakespearean   territory  —   at least until a   evening skirt with a simple silk blouse, molded red velvet trouser suit and series of    embroidered gowns tore free of the heavy hand, and fabrics, of their more   antecedents. Perhaps the question itself is too weighty these days  —   which is why, at Diane von Furstenberg, Jonathan Saunders took a somewhat alternative approach and chose to reframe the issue in the mantra of the brand’s founder, “Feel like a woman, wear a dress!” “Optimism and color,” Mr. Saunders said of what he wanted to communicate with his collection of    shades, fur jackets (faux and real, in candy colors) scarf silks and skinny knits. Pattern clashed with print and paillettes  —   polka dot with florals and stripes with leopard spots  —   but the easy shapes kept it in line. There was nothing hard about these clothes, from fabric to form. Forget the existential issues for a moment, they said, and have a little fun. And for that moment, milling about the art gallery where the presentation took place, everyone did.	1

225	This is definitely not the way that announcers in New Orleans  —   or, for that matter, commentators on the TNT network  —   will introduce the   lineup for the N. B. A. ’s slam dunk contest on Saturday night. “Please welcome   …     Aaron Gordon, who has averaged 8. 8 points per game in three seasons for the Orlando Magic   …     “Derrick Jones Jr. who has scored a total of 11 points in seven games for the Phoenix Suns   …     “Glenn Robinson III, with his 4.  average over five seasons for three different teams . .. “And DeAndre Jordan, the one name casual fans should know, with his   averages of 8. 9 points and 10 rebounds in nine years with the titleless Los Angeles Clippers. ” You will not hear any such statistics cited on   Saturday night, even though it is absolutely true that none of the participants have managed to average 9 points a game over the course of a career. The N. B. A. which can no longer persuade its biggest names to participate in such a risky novelty event, seems to be doing just fine with its   and   players headlining the dunk contest. Last year’s event, in Toronto, for example, was an aesthetic and ratings success. Once airborne, the contest was a   showdown between Zach LaVine, the eventual winner, and Gordon that brought back memories of Michael Jordan versus Dominique Wilkins in the 1980s, minus the outsize reputations. LaVine passed the ball behind his back before one dunk. Gordon routed it through his legs on a reverse dunk. According to The Associated Press, the telecast drew seven million viewers at its peak, the highest total for any cable show that night. A dunk contest among LeBron James, Russell Westbrook, Blake Griffin and John Wall would surely attract a larger audience. But the event requires too much rehearsal and too many hard landings for such a commitment by established superstars. LaVine has emerged recently as something of a dunk celebrity, and he might have given the contest in New Orleans a significant boost. But even before his season ended this month with a torn anterior cruciate ligament, LaVine announced that he would not vie for a third consecutive victory. There are only so many ways you can ram a basketball through a hoop. “I feel like I’ve accomplished everything I could in the dunk contest,” LaVine, 21, told reporters last month. “It would be hard for me to go back and outdo myself. I’m never saying I won’t ever do it again, but I’m focused on this year. Getting the rest and just focusing more on just the game is the main thing. ” While the cast of daredevils continues to change, there remains a core fan base that simply loves outrageous pretzel jams by relatively anonymous contestants. That theory will be put to its biggest test on Saturday, with the quartet of    ? If even this event manages to pull strong ratings, organizers should consider an even greater leap of faith: Do participants really need to be N. B. A. players, or basketball players at all? Couldn’t tall,   acrobats manage even trickier circus dunks? The league could include both players and nonplayers, calling the event “Dunking With the Stars. ” When it comes to luring big names to its   break antics, Major League Baseball has easily eclipsed the N. B. A. Baseball continues to showcase some of its biggest stars in its home run derby  —   which has attracted TV viewership similar to the dunk contest’s in recent years. But its audience appeal also seems more dependent on   names. Giancarlo Stanton beat such notables as Robinson Cano and Todd Frazier in 2016, when the derby drew 5. 5 million viewers, according to the Sports TV Ratings website. Viewership was higher in 2015, at 7. 1 million, when Kris Bryant and Anthony Rizzo of the Chicago Cubs joined the festivities. It may be that baseball’s stars are more easily persuaded to participate in the home run derby because the contest requires little practice and, unlike the dunk contest’s reliance on judging, is decided by a simple, objective standard  —   how many baseballs are knocked over the wall. Still, even such a straightforward event requires a great deal of energy and is not tailored for frazzled veterans. “The home run derby wears you out,” David Ortiz told WEEI. com when he decided not to participate in the 2016 event. “It’s good for the younger guys to do it, puts you on the map for a minute. It takes everything out of you. You definitely have to be in your 20s to do it. ” That goes double for the dunk contest. Double twist, with a reverse finish.	1
165	WASHINGTON  —   Employees of the Environmental Protection Agency have been calling their senators to urge them to vote on Friday against the confirmation of Scott Pruitt, President Trump’s contentious nominee to run the agency, a remarkable display of activism and defiance that presages turbulent times ahead for the E. P. A. Many of the scientists, environmental lawyers and policy experts who work in E. P. A. offices around the country say the calls are a last resort for workers who fear a nominee selected to run an agency he has made a career out of fighting  —   by a president who has vowed to “get rid of” it. “Mr. Pruitt’s background speaks for itself, and it comes on top of what the president wants to do to E. P. A. ,” said John O’Grady, a biochemist at the agency since the first Bush administration and president of the union representing the E. P. A. ’s 15, 000 employees nationwide. Nicole Cantello, an E. P. A. lawyer who heads the union in the Chicago area, said: “It seems like Trump and Pruitt want a complete reversal of what E. P. A. has done. I don’t know if there’s any other agency that’s been so reviled. So it’s in our interests to do this. ” The union has sent emails and posted Facebook and Twitter messages urging members to make the calls. “It is rare,” said James A. Thurber, the director of the Center for Congressional and Presidential Studies at American University. “I can’t think of any other time when people in the bureaucracy have done this. ” The campaign is not likely to succeed. Before Friday’s vote, two Democratic senators, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota and Joe Manchin III of West Virginia, announced that they would vote for Mr. Pruitt’s confirmation, and only one Republican, Susan Collins of Maine, has said she will oppose him. But because Civil Service rules make it difficult to fire federal workers, the show of defiance indicates that Mr. Pruitt will face strong internal opposition to many of his promised efforts to curtail E. P. A. activities and influence. “What it means is that it’s going to be a blood bath when Pruitt gets in there,” said Christine Todd Whitman, a Republican former governor of New Jersey and the E. P. A. administrator during the first term of President George W. Bush. Ms. Whitman predicted a standoff between career employees and their politically appointed bosses, noting that Mr. Pruitt would be blocked by legal Civil Service protections from immediately firing longtime employees, but would probably be able to retaliate in other ways, such as shifting them to different jobs. The showdown could embolden the White House and Congress to change federal Civil Service laws. “The Civil Service is supposed to be a class of experts implementing policy, regardless of politics,” said Myron Ebell, a fellow at the   Competitive Enterprise Institute, who led Mr. Trump’s environmental transition team. “If they have now become a special interest group pleading their own agenda, then it is probably time to look at reforming the Civil Service laws. ” The revolt has also angered supporters of Mr. Pruitt. “There clearly has been an organized effort to demonize Pruitt, and I think that’s unfair and unfortunate,” said Jeffrey Holmstead, a senior E. P. A. official in the George W. Bush administration who has been mentioned as a possible deputy to Mr. Pruitt. “I don’t remember, in my time, anything like this. But I think that anyone Trump nominated would be targeted. ” “We know that he’ll dismantle Clean Power Plan and the Waters of the U. S. rule, but he’s not going to go in there and start firing people,” said Mr. Holmstead, referring to Obama regulations on climate change and water pollution. Mr. Pruitt, the attorney general of Oklahoma, has sued the E. P. A. at least 14 times, often in concert with the nation’s largest fossil fuel companies, to block major environmental regulations. He has questioned   global warming and is a key architect of the national legal effort to dismantle former President Barack Obama’s climate change policies. He has harshly criticized the role of the federal agency, saying much of its authority should be dissolved and left to the states. Mr. Pruitt’s legal views on environmental protection broadly, and the role of the E. P. A. specifically, appear to line up with Mr. Trump’s campaign claim that “Environmental Protection, what they do is a disgrace. ” Within days of Mr. Pruitt’s   Mr. Trump is expected to sign one or more executive orders aimed at undoing Mr. Obama’s climate change regulations, and possibly to begin dismantling some E. P. A. offices and programs, people familiar with the White House’s plans said. While it will be impossible to undo most major rules or programs that quickly, the presidential signatures would authorize Mr. Pruitt to cut existing environmental regulations  —   and, eventually, the jobs of many of the people who enforce them. Ms. Cantello said most of her career at the E. P. A. had been focused on water protection, particularly on cleaning pollution in the Great Lakes. “I’m afraid all the work I’ve done will be abandoned,” she said. Ms. Cantello and other longtime agency employees said that while they sometimes chafed under the administration of George W. Bush, who sought to loosen some environmental rules, they did not openly rebel against it  —   nor, they said, did they fear that Mr. Bush and his appointees wanted to eliminate the agency. “I’ve been here for 30 years, and I’ve never called my senator about a nominee before,” said an E. P. A. employee in North Carolina who spoke on the condition of anonymity out of fear of losing her job. The calls to senators come on top of an   protest last week by Chicago E. P. A. employees, and agency workers say that if Mr. Pruitt is confirmed, they intend to amplify their resistance to him, taking their case to the American public. “At this point, it’s just, ‘call your senator,’” Mr. O’Grady, the union president, said. “We plan on more demonstrations, more rallies. I think you will see the employees’ union reaching out to N. G. O.s and having alliances with them,” he added, referring to nongovernmental organizations. “We’re looking at working with P. R. firms. ” The White House and E. P. A. did not respond to emailed questions about the employees’ campaign. The E. P. A. emerged as a Republican political target during the Obama administration, after Mr. Obama turned to the agency to muscle through an environmental agenda that could not get through Congress. While Mr. Trump campaigned on slashing   rules on climate change and waterways, his efforts might also be thwarted by Congress. But the E. P. A. is likely to be at the center of his antiregulatory agenda. Experts say it is not surprising that liberal and environmental groups like the Sierra Club have campaigned against Mr. Pruitt. Over 700 former E. P. A. employees have signed a letter to senators opposing his confirmation. The Center for Media and Democracy, a   group, successfully sued the Oklahoma attorney general’s office to release about 3, 000 of Mr. Pruitt’s emails, which they say could reveal more about his ties to fossil fuel companies. An Oklahoma judge ruled Thursday that the emails must be released but gave the attorney general’s office until Tuesday to comply, long enough to avoid roiling the confirmation vote unless Democrats can persuade Senate Republicans to hold off. But former E. P. A. officials said the open rebellion by current employees was extraordinary, especially considering that their resistance could backfire once Mr. Pruitt arrives on the job. “E. P. A. staff are pretty careful. They’re ” said Judith Enck, who left the agency last month. “If people are saying and doing things like this, it’s because they’re really concerned. ” Senator Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio, said on Wednesday that his office had received dozens of calls from people both opposing and supporting Mr. Pruitt’s nomination, including E. P. A. employees, and that he had not yet decided whether to vote for him. “I do have concerns about the Great Lakes,” he said. Mr. O’Grady said that he expected the calls to continue through Friday’s vote. “I pray they don’t dismantle the E. P. A. ,” he said. “It’s going to be like Humpty Dumpty  —   very difficult to put back together again. ”	1
801	 I just want to cry. We have very few jobs in Michigan's Upper Peninsula but we're taking 4500 Syrian refugees.

They are selected by the United Nations, screened by the FBI, and resettled into more than 190 cities and towns across America. President Obama plans to bring in 85,000 refugees next year; including 10,000 from ISIS controlled territory in Syria.The smallest city on the list, Menominee, MI, with a population of just over 8,500 residents, will feel the greatest impact. With 4,500 refugees accepted for relocation, Menominee will see its demographics drastically change almost overnight. City leaders in Menominee have agreed to fund a mosque/school for Muslim refugees, utilizing one of the many empty, unused buildings in the downtown area. Volunteers from the United Way will provide care packages and will help refugees adjust to life in small town America.   A story circulating on the Internet and flying through Facebook regarding 4,500 Syrian refugees coming to Menominee is not true, according to a Menominee city official. Menominee officials have not discussed the issue at any meetings, the spokesperson told the EagleHerald. People should disregard the story that is appearing out of a site called “The National Report.”  	0
210	Late last year I started reading a biography of Chester A. Arthur. Quickly, I began to feel as if I’d wandered into the plot of a Philip K. Dick novel, or succumbed to an especially unnerving fever dream. The book, by Zachary Karabell, tells the story of a deeply unpopular and untrustworthy New Yorker who, against all odds, achieves the presidency. Arthur, a   emblem of the   culture of the day, was never even elected to the highest office. His ascent was made possible by Charles J. Guiteau, the man who gunned down President James Garfield in a railroad station, thus promoting Arthur from the vice presidency. To contemporaries, the situation seemed dire. Arthur’s administration surely would be defined by unprecedented greed and corruption, full of woefully underqualified appointees lacking any experience in government. Even the most optimistic American could hardly have imagined that Arthur’s presidency would be a success. But as I continued reading, I was astonished to discover that Arthur redeemed himself. He championed   reform, hobbling the “spoils system” with which he had been so closely associated. He restored faith in the presidency, and faith in what the presidency can restore in its occupants. “No man ever entered the presidency so profoundly and widely distrusted as Chester Alan Arthur,” wrote the Gilded Age journalist Alexander K. McClure, “and no one ever retired . .. more generally respected, alike by political friend and foe. ” I finished the biography in late 2016, but found myself still carrying it with me as Donald J. Trump prepared to take office. I wasn’t rereading it, not exactly. Sometimes, when my dog lingered by a particularly intriguing tree, I’d open it up to a passage I’d marked. Other times, it served as a base for my phone, as if it were in conversation with the disquieting tweets I scrolled through. And during those notably edgy moments in late January, I’d hold onto it tight, like a security blanket, or just want it nearby, so that I could occasionally tap on it like a talisman. As an American historian, I’ve long relied on presidential biographies for edification and pleasure. If I’m using biographies to write a book or an essay, I have them propped up on a stand, next to my highlighters, pencils,   Notes and paper clips. But now my work doubles as an antidepressant these books are rife with the kind of horrors that led half of the country to believe, at any given time, that they were living out the end of the American experiment. I now surround myself with presidential biographies the way I would tissues if I had the flu. There’s a stack of them next to my bed, a few by the front door and some more next to the couch. You’ll spot them on my windowsill and   table, above the fridge and in my bathroom. They’re hidden around my car, and just this morning I remembered that I’d tucked a small published conference paper on George Washington’s nationalism into the interior pocket of my North Face puffy jacket. This obsession comes with a physical cost. The tomes make the straps of my bag dig painfully into my shoulder. Even the slenderest of biographies from the Arthur Schlesinger presidential series runs around 200 pages, and a Ron Chernow joint will push past 800. There are other costs, too. Having found some solace in these countless moments of national resilience amid chaos, I find myself constantly pushing these biographies onto others, believing in their therapeutic powers, and replacing my own copies time and again. Calvin Coolidge had a major depressive episode and basically checked out, I texted a worried friend  —   but we survived, I added, asking for her address. F. D. R. was an aristocrat before he contracted polio, I told another over drinks, reluctantly sliding over a   volume about how suffering transformed him. Ronald Reagan tried and failed to do away with the Energy and Education Departments, I told an acquaintance who teaches English. I was lugging around a thick George H. W. Bush book a few months ago when I decided, on the walk to an event where I’d be speaking, against reading from the biography and instead to read a segment I’d written for my podcast, “Presidents Are People, Too!” The event’s hosts quickly cued up a recent photo of Bush and his wife, which shone behind me as I read a letter George wrote about Barbara in 1943. The audience howled at the line “she is so very young and so darn attractive. ” But they might have laughed harder at the concerned email he wrote to his eldest granddaughters when they were off on spring break, shortly after he came across what he called the “’u2009‘Wild College Women’ TV show. ” Presidential biographies don’t tell you that everything is going to be O. K. but rather that nothing was ever really O. K. to begin with. And yet, for hundreds of years, Americans have not only survived heartbreaking, backbreaking periods but also stood tall in them. My advice, for these divisive times, is to find the perspective that history gives us. The next time you feel anxious or incensed, or even if you feel hopeful and gratified, turn off the television. Close your laptop. Silence your phone. Go ahead and put it   down for the rest of the evening. Instead, choose to hang out with the likes of President Chester A. Arthur: It’s good for your health.	1
658	 Abstinence advocate and culture war blogger Bristol Palin recently lashed out at black actors who have complained that the slate of nominees for this year’s Oscars were all white. In a blog post on Tuesday, Palin said she agreed with Fox News contributor Stacey Dash’s opinion that both Black History Month and the BET network should not exist as special privileges for the black community.“Stacey Dash couldn’t be more right,” Palin commented on her post. “What more do black people want? They complained about slavery – we abolished it. They complained about oppression in the 60’s – we made sure there was no more of it. Then they started bitching about how America has never had a black president – we gave them Obama. Now they’re trying to make it look like we’re intentionally depriving them of money and fame. I mean, come on, people! You’ve got drug dealers, you’ve got rap and hip-hop singers, you’ve got just as much money as white people, and not to mention, your numbers are growing. It seems to me like we ought to be complaining about you, not the other way around! … even if there were black actors who are good enough” to be nominated for an Academy Award, “it’d be too difficult to choose one, since they all look alike.” “How do you tell apart Lawrence Fishburne from Samuel L. Jackson? You don’t! At least I can’t. I mean, if I didn’t know any better, I’d think Sam Jackson played Morpheus in the Matrix Trilogy. So, don’t be talking about the Oscars when you clearly don’t deserve one.” We shouldn’t segregate ourselves or limit Black History Month to one month a year. I wish things were really colorblind… I don’t know what we can do as a society to come together as one.Ss far as what I have seen about the #OscarSoWhite Controversy, it seems Jada Smith started it because her husband wasn’t getting nominated. I don’t know how other people think about it, but I hope my son sees early on – that not everyone gets a trophy. Newslo is the first hybrid News/Satire platform on the web.

26	Times journalists are in Iraq’s Sunni heartland to evaluate rebuilding efforts after battles with the Islamic State. FALLUJA, Iraq  —   Iraqi forces had taken Falluja from the Islamic State months before, and Sabah Rashid was more than ready to return home. But the police warned him not to go. Fleeing Islamic State fighters had rigged bombs all through his south Falluja neighborhood, and these had still not been cleared, they told him. Insurgent corpses were said to lay unrecovered. Mr. Rashid, 30, a determined sort, moved back into his ransacked house anyway  —   he and his family fled the Islamic State three years ago and did not want to wait. Last week, they were camped out in their sagging house with no heat, electricity or running water. They boiled water on a wood fire. And they waited with mounting frustration for promised government aid. Nearly eight months after the recapture of Falluja showed that Iraq’s government could wrest one of the Islamic State’s major support bases away from it, the victory now seems at risk. The   national government has not yet demonstrated that it can secure and rebuild this shattered Sunni city, soothe sectarian grievances or provide for 250, 000 returning residents. Iraqi and American security officials now fear that if the Sunnis of Falluja are given no reason to trust the government, they may once again embrace the Islamic State, also known as ISIS and ISIL. Local officials say Islamic State sleeper cells remain active, and many residents continue to aid the insurgents. Guerrilla attacks have resumed in one of the most recent episodes, a suicide car bomb on Jan. 28 killed two police officers. The seeds of an incomplete victory were there from the start. Falluja had long been disaffected from the government, and it was the first Iraqi city to fall under Islamic State control. Even with the group mostly driven out, the government faced a widespread lack of trust. Further, the battle relied heavily on Shiite militia forces, many of which are backed by Iran, and reports of sectarian abuses of the Sunni population started almost immediately. In one case, the governor of surrounding Anbar Province said that militia fighters and some of their allies in the security forces had summarily executed 49 Sunnis from Falluja and tortured others. The government tried to keep the militias out of Falluja to avoid antagonizing Sunni residents. But many entered the city dressed as policemen, Sunni lawmakers said. Local officials said Shiite militiamen were now confined to checkpoints on Falluja’s outskirts, about 40 miles west of Baghdad. “Of course, violations occurred in some places,” by Shiite militiamen, said Salam Ajmi, a Falluja municipal councilman. But now, he said, some Sunni residents were cooperating with security forces to help root out Islamic State sleeper cells. A visit to Falluja by Times journalists showed that last summer’s battle had left some sections of the city relatively unscathed, but had reduced others to rubble. Many streets were littered with crumpled buildings, collapsed roofs and   cars, all coated with gray dust. The skeleton of a crushed Humvee lay near Mr. Rashid’s home. For Mr. Rashid, the satisfaction of returning home was dimmed by resentment toward local Sunni officials charged with rebuilding the city. “We get nothing from them but promises  —   we are on our own,” he said as his two young sons fed dry grass to the campfire. The family members survive on food purchased at a newly opened market in a nearby district. Their own Al Alamin neighborhood offered only a bleak panorama of   homes and deserted streets. “Falluja has had some hard lessons  —   we hope this will be our last hard lesson,” said Sheikh Talib   the head of Falluja’s local council, who has promised returnees that help is on the way. Mr. Efan spoke in a cold, darkened room, within a building he said had been used as an Islamic State headquarters and was now the council’s makeshift office. The electricity sputtered on and off. Mr. Efan is a returnee himself. His three homes  —   one for each wife  —   were destroyed during the Islamic State occupation, he said. He has lived at a friend’s house since returning in August. “People have to expect delays,” he said. “They need to be patient. ” The United Nations Development Program said it had made stopgap repairs to the city’s main teaching hospital and to five schools and health centers. The agency has restored rudimentary electricity and water in many areas, cleared debris and hired 300 locals to clean streets. Lise Grande, the United Nations deputy special representative in Iraq, said the agency’s stabilization work was to help patch up Falluja until more permanent repairs could be made. The agency has spent $8. 6 million of $18. 5 million allocated  —   a small fraction of the amount needed to rebuild the city. Mr. Ajmi, the councilman, said the council had little funding. Depressed oil prices have kept Iraq’s economy floundering. Life is precarious everywhere, he said, not just in Falluja. Hussein Ahmed, 53, who lived in a   camp for three years, said he had lost patience with the council. He returned to Falluja to find his house wrecked  —   the third he has lost. Two previous homes were destroyed during battles against fighters for Al Qaeda in Iraq, he said. “We were hurt badly by Daesh,” he said, using the Arabic acronym for the Islamic State. “And now we’re being hurt by our own government. ” Mr. Ahmed pointed to an expanse of toppled buildings: “This area was liberated in June, and it still looks the same now. ” Other returning residents nodded as Mr. Ahmed added, “I speak for thousands of people when I say the government has forgotten us. ” Falluja has endured tragedy on an epic scale since 2003. The city was pounded during repeated battles  —   first between the United States and Saddam Hussein’s forces in 2003, then between American Marines and Al Qaeda fighters. Most insurgents were eventually evicted with the help of Sunni tribal fighters. But the insurgency was reborn as the Islamic State. It overran Falluja in December 2013, and the city became an important base for the group’s operations. One reason the government assaulted the city last May, even before turning to the critical campaign for Mosul, to the north, was to curb a devastating car bomb campaign against Baghdad that was being operated from Falluja. Now, the United States military is working with Iraqi forces to prevent Islamic State fighters from rising up in Falluja again, said a spokesman, Col. John L. Dorrian. “They have proved very resilient,” he said. Falluja is hardly the government’s only worry in a nation with 3. 1 million internally displaced people. The government is pouring resources into the Mosul battle while also trying to rebuild Falluja and Ramadi, in Anbar Province, and to repair the city of Tikrit, farther north. Of the 320, 000 people who fled Falluja for aid camps, about 250, 000 have returned since   the United Nations said. They are desperate to live at home again, whatever the risk. In south Falluja, First Lt. Walid Mohammed of the police shook his head as Mr. Rashid and his children tended their campfire. “We told them the risk is all theirs,” he said. “They are responsible if anything happens, not us. ” Elisabeth Koek, of the Norwegian Refugee Council in Iraq, said about letting residents return to dangerous areas deprived of public services: “This is incredibly worrying. ” Mr. Rashid said he returned even after a   killed a returnee in a supposedly cleared area nearby. After Mr. Rashid moved in, a woman was killed by an explosion on Jan. 31 as she was repairing her home in the same area, police said. Mr. Rashid said he was accustomed to danger. He lifted his shirt to reveal jagged, crimson scars on his belly from an Islamic State bomb that he said blew up the family car in late 2013. The blackened front seat lay in the front yard. A tall,   man suddenly appeared: Mohammed Saeed, 49, a neighbor whom Mr. Rashid had not seen since 2013. Mr. Saed had returned that morning, three years after fleeing. His home was dirty and bereft of electricity or water. But he was moving in. Mr. Saed kissed Mr. Rashid on both cheeks. “I’m so happy,” he told him. “It’s a dangerous, terrible place, but we are home. ”	1
367	In Virginia, Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents waited outside a church shelter where undocumented immigrants had gone to stay warm. In Texas and in Colorado, agents went into courthouses, looking for foreigners who had arrived for hearings on other matters. At Kennedy International Airport in New York, passengers arriving after a   flight from San Francisco were asked to show their documents before they were allowed to get off the plane. The Trump administration’s   plan to arrest and deport vast numbers of undocumented immigrants has been introduced in dramatic fashion over the past month. And much of that task has fallen to thousands of ICE officers who are newly emboldened, newly empowered and already getting to work. Gone are the   rules that required them to focus only on serious criminals. In Southern California, in one of the first major roundups during the Trump administration, officers detained 161 people with a wide range of felony and misdemeanor convictions, and 10 who had no criminal history at all. “Before, we used to be told, ‘You can’t arrest those people,’ and we’d be disciplined for being insubordinate if we did,” said a   veteran of the agency who took part in the operation. “Now those people are priorities again. And there are a lot of them here. ” Interviews with 17 agents and officials across the country, including in Florida, Alabama, Texas, Arizona, Washington and California, demonstrated how quickly a new atmosphere in the agency had taken hold. Since they are forbidden to talk to the press, they requested anonymity out of concern for losing their jobs. The White House press secretary, Sean Spicer, said on Tuesday that the president wanted to “take the shackles off” of agents, an expression the officers themselves used time and again in interviews to describe their newfound freedom. “Morale amongst our agents and officers has increased exponentially since the signing of the orders,” the unions representing ICE and Border Patrol agents said in a joint statement after President Trump issued the executive orders on immigration late last month. Two memos released this past week by the Department of Homeland Security, the parent agency of ICE and the Border Patrol, provided more details about how it would carry out its plan, which includes Mr. Trump’s signature campaign pledge  —   a wall along the entire southern border  —   as well as speedier deportations and greater reliance on local police officers. But for those with ICE badges, perhaps the biggest change was the erasing of the Obama administration’s hierarchy of priorities, which forced agents to concentrate on deporting gang members and other violent and serious criminals, and mostly leave everyone else alone. A whirlwind of activity has overtaken ICE headquarters in Washington in recent weeks, with employees attending    meetings about how to quickly carry out President Trump’s plans. “Some people are like: ‘This is great. Let’s give them all the tools they need,’” said a senior staff member at headquarters, who joined the department under the administration of George W. Bush. But, the official added, “other people are a little bit more hesitant and fearful about how quickly things are moving. ” Two officials in Washington said that the shift  —   and the new enthusiasm that has come with it  —   seems to have encouraged   political comments and banter that struck the officials as brazen or   like remarks about their jobs becoming “fun. ” Those who take less of a hard line on unauthorized immigrants feel silenced, the officials said. ICE has more than 20, 000 employees, spread across 400 offices in the United States and 46 foreign countries, and the Trump administration has called for the hiring of 10, 000 more. ICE officers see themselves as protecting the country and enforcing its laws, but also, several agents said, defending the legal immigration system, with its yearslong waits to enter the country, from people who skip the line. John F. Kelly, the secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, said in a statement after the first   roundups of the Trump administration: “President Trump has been clear in affirming the critical mission of D. H. S. in protecting the nation. ” “There is no greater calling than to serve and protect our nation,” he added, “a mission that the men and women of ICE perform with professionalism and courage every single day. ” Agents are, in fact, predominantly male and have often served in the military, with a police department or both. New agents take a   Spanish language program as well as firearms training they also learn driving maneuvers and have to pass seven written examinations and a   test that includes an obstacle course. The element of surprise is central to their work, and the sight of even a single white van emblazoned with the words Department of Homeland Security can create fear and cause people to flee. To minimize public contact, the arrests are frequently made in the early morning hours. A supervisor in Northern California described a typical operation, with teams of at least five members rising before dawn, meeting as early as 4 a. m. to make arrests before their targets depart for work. To avoid distressing families and children, the agents prefer to apprehend people outside their homes, approaching them as soon as they step onto a public sidewalk and, once identified, placing them in handcuffs. But arrests can appear dramatic, as agents arrive in large numbers, armed with semiautomatic handguns and wearing dark bulletproof vests with ICE in bright white letters on them. When they do have to enter a home, officers knock loudly and announce themselves as the police, a term they can legally use. Many times, children are awakened in the process, and watch as a parent is taken away. Some of the more visible ICE operations in recent weeks have ricocheted around the internet, and sometimes drawn a backlash. At Kennedy Airport, Customs and Border Protection agents checked documents of passengers getting off a flight from San Francisco because ICE, a sister agency, thought a person with a deportation order might be on the plane. They did not find the person they were looking for. After the arrests outside the church in Alexandria, Va. Gov. Terry McAuliffe, a Democrat, wrote a letter to Mr. Kelly, saying the action “raises a concern that, unlike previous actions, ICE agents are detaining Virginia residents without cause or specific allegations of criminal activity. ” Bystanders are now being taken in if they are suspected to be undocumented, even if they have committed no crime, known within the agency as “collateral” arrests. While these arrests occurred under the Obama administration, they were officially discouraged, to the frustration of many agents. “Which part of illegal don’t people understand?” an agent in Arizona asked. But officers said their work had become more political than ever, and they bristled at what they considered stereotypes of indiscriminate enforcers who want to sweep grandmothers off the street or separate families. Perhaps their biggest challenge, said the supervisor in California, is the agency’s steadily deteriorating relationship with other law enforcement agencies, especially in   cities that have vowed to protect immigrants from deportation, known as sanctuary cities. In one city alone, the supervisor said, the police once transferred 35 undocumented immigrants a day into federal custody, compared with roughly five per week during the final years of the Obama presidency. On Thursday, Los Angeles, a sanctuary city, asked that ICE agents stop calling themselves police officers, saying it was damaging residents’ trust of the city’s own police officers. Although all of the agents interviewed felt the old priorities had kept them from doing their jobs, John Sandweg, an acting director of ICE in the Obama administration, defended the rules as making the best use of limited resources. Without them, he said, fewer dangerous people might get deported. “There are 10 seats on the bus, they go to the first 10 you grab,” Mr. Sandweg said. “It diminishes the chances that it’s a violent offender. ” He said that he had spent a lot of time on the road, speaking at town halls where he heard a great deal from the    agents about the priorities. “Certainly they were not terribly popular,” he said. “They wanted unfettered discretion. ” Agents said that even with the added freedom, they would still go after the people who presented the greatest danger to the public. And what Mr. Sandweg called unfettered discretion, they called enforcing the law. “The discretion has come back to us it’s up to us to make decisions in the field,” a   veteran in California said. “We’re trusted again. ”	1
23	■ President Trump, Japan’s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, and their wives will fly to    in Palm Beach, Fla. for dinner and a weekend of golf. ■ Treasury   Steven Mnuchin’s confirmation vote, originally slated for a rare Saturday session in the Senate, has been pushed to Monday. Mr. Trump overruled his newly minted secretary of state, Rex W. Tillerson, and rejected the secretary’s choice for his deputy at the department, two people briefed on the decision said Friday. The deputy’s job was denied for Elliott Abrams, a conservative who had served under President Ronald Reagan and President George W. Bush, deals a blow to Mr. Tillerson in his first week on the job. The rejection of Mr. Abrams leaves Mr. Tillerson without a sherpa to help guide the   government official around the State Department headquarters. Mr. Trump had a productive meeting with Mr. Abrams on Tuesday, according to a White House official and a person close to Mr. Abrams. But after it took place, Mr. Trump learned of Mr. Abrams’s pointed criticisms of the president when he was running for president, the administration official said. Among those criticisms was a column headlined “When You Can’t Stand Your Candidate,” which appeared in May 2016 in The Weekly Standard. Mr. Trump has been increasingly focused on who was with him or against him during his campaign, according to several people who have spoken with him in recent days. Mr. Tillerson had argued strongly for Mr. Abrams. So had Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump’s    and a senior adviser. Senator Tom Cotton, Republican of Arkansas who is closely aligned with friends of Mr. Abrams’ and some members of the   lobbying group Aipac, had been reaching out to Democratic senators to impress upon them the importance of Mr. Abrams receiving Senate confirmation. Aides to Mr. Trump did not respond to an email seeking comment. The revelation that Michael T. Flynn, President Trump’s national security adviser, apparently discussed sanctions with Russia’s ambassador to the United States in the weeks before the inauguration has given Democrats a new cudgel to revive discussions of Mr. Trump’s ties to Russian President Vladimir V. Putin. And they are swinging it. Representative Eric Swalwell of California, the ranking Democrat on the C. I. A. subcommittee of the House Intelligence Committee, called it “a crime for someone outside of our government to negotiate with foreign entities on our nation’s behalf. ” Senators Christopher S. Murphy of Connecticut and Edward J. Markey of Massachusetts, both Democrats, were similarly scathing in a joint statement. Said Mr. Murphy: With the legal fight over President Trump’s travel ban apparently headed for the Supreme Court, a leading contender for the job of arguing the government’s cases before the highest court has dropped out of consideration. The candidate, Charles J. Cooper, said he was withdrawing as a possible nominee for solicitor general of the United States “after witnessing the treatment of my friend Jeff Sessions,” who was approved as attorney general Wednesday evening after bruising attacks by Senate Democrats over his civil rights record. Mr. Cooper, a conservative Washington lawyer who argued against gay marriage in an important California case, said that after what Mr. Sessions “had to endure at the hands of a partisan opposition that will say anything and do anything to advance their political interests, I am unwilling to subject myself, my family, and my friends to such a process. ” His withdrawal appears to leave George T. Conway, a New York lawyer who is married to Kellyanne Conway, a top White House aide, as the leading contender for solicitor general. Mr. Trump said Thursday that he expected to select a new nominee in about a week. Whoever gets confirmed for the job could end up arguing the legality of Mr. Trump’s travel ban before the Supreme Court. No wonder Mr. Trump wants the Mexicans to pay for it. The wall on the southern border  —   really a set of fences and walls  —   would take three and a half years to build and would cost $21. 6 billion, according to an internal report by the Department of Homeland Security that was seen by Reuters. That’s well over the $12 billion estimated by Mr. Trump during the campaign, and the upper bound of $15 billion cited by Republican leaders in Congress. At a time when federal deficits are again expected to grow, the amount is not pocket change. As the population ages and draws on Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, the Congressional Budget Office is already expecting the government to heap nearly $10 trillion onto the federal debt over the coming decade  —   and that is with statutory caps on domestic and military spending. Mr. Trump has already vowed to bust through those caps on the military side of the ledger, something that would take an act of Congress. Now he’ll have to pay extra for his promised wall  —   either out of existing domestic programs or above the nondefense caps. Mr. Trump is still pretty miffed that a   panel of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously upheld a restraining order against his travel ban from seven   countries. We can also deduce what he was watching on television: MSNBC’s Morning Joe. Wonder why it took 12 minutes to compose that post on Twitter. On Thursday night, The New York Times published a scoop: the president of the United States had not spoken to the president of China, Xi Jinping, who was icing him out over his unorthodox call with the leader of Taiwan during his transition to power, and his suggestion that just maybe, Washington would no longer follow the “One China” policy (which affirms that Taiwan is a province of the mainland). Hours later, the White House issued a statement that, hey, not only had Mr. Trump just spoken to Mr. Xi, he had also expressed support for the One China policy after all  —   something Mr. Trump had said he would do only in return for concessions. The Times story was rewritten accordingly, capturing the news. But Mr. Trump does not accept the chronology  —   at least not publicly. Hillary Clinton has been slow to emerge after her November defeat. But there she was on social media Thursday night, praising the unanimous decision by a   panel of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals to uphold a nationwide restraining order against Mr. Trump’s travel ban for seven   countries. To which Kellyanne Conway, the Trump     House adviser, had a reply. Winning is everything. First came the video of Representative Mike Coffman of Colorado sneaking out a back door to avoid the angry crowd gathered for his town hall meeting  —   but his suburban Denver district is swingy. Then Representative Tom McClintock of California had to flee under guard as constituents in Roseville demanded to know why he was so bent on repealing the Affordable Care Act. But hey, it’s California  —   even though his turf outside Sacramento isn’t exactly Berkeley. But Utah? On Wednesday, it was Representative Jason Chaffetz’s turn  —   in the reddest of states, in the Salt Lake City suburb Cottonwood Heights. It’s getting ugly out there.	1
216	MUNICH  —   While President Trump has disrupted assumptions about American foreign policy, members of his cabinet have been scrambling to reassure allies that the United States remains a bedrock of support. The trouble is, after four weeks of tumult at the White House, the allies are not sure who to believe. Mr. Trump has questioned the European Union and NATO, spoken admiringly of Russia and upended Middle East diplomacy. His proxies have maintained that the United States is still a deterrent to Russia and China, a credible arbiter in the Middle East and a faithful ally to Europe. The skepticism over who is in charge in Washington was crystallized on Friday at an annual meeting of dignitaries in Munich for a yearly security conference. Germany’s defense minister, Ursula von der Leyen, caused ripples when she pointedly expressed appreciation for the American “secretary of defense’s strong commitment to NATO. ” She was referring to Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, who has spent his week in Europe trying to persuade allies that contrary to what President Trump has said in the United States, the country has not soured on the   alliance. Several people at the conference instantly took note on Twitter of Ms. Von der Leyen’s phrasing, including Vali Nasr, dean of the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies. Vice President Mike Pence, who arrived in Munich on Friday night Mr. Mattis Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly and Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson, a few miles up the road in Bonn  —   have all spent much of the week soothing European ears, presenting traditional Republican national security orthodoxy of confronting Russia, supporting NATO and backing democratic institutions. But every time they seemed to be getting traction in convincing skittish diplomats that Mr. Trump was not about to abandon decades of American national security policy, their boss did something in Washington that undercut their work. The result has been confusion among global leaders about whom to believe when it comes to the direction of American national security. The reassuring message Mr. Trump’s subordinates have sought to convey has been further undermined by some of his own Republican critics. Senator John McCain, whose disdain for Mr. Trump is well known, was quoted by Reuters as saying at the Munich conference that Michael T. Flynn’s resignation as Mr. Trump’s national security adviser over his Russia liaisons was “something that shows that in many respects this administration is in disarray and they’ve got a lot of work to do. ” The contradictions have abounded. On Wednesday, Mr. Trump seemed to abandon a broad international consensus on how to achieve peace between Israelis and Palestinians, asserting that he was not committed to a   solution.   hours later, his United Nations envoy said, “We absolutely support a   solution,” adding that the administration simply wanted a “thinking out of the box” approach about resolving one of the world’s intractable conflicts. The same day that Mr. Trump questioned the   approach, Mr. Mattis was at NATO headquarters telling allies that the commitment of the United States to NATO remained firm. But Mr. Mattis also echoed his boss when he warned that the United States might “moderate” its support if other member countries did not spend more on the military. The next day, still at NATO, Mr. Mattis was back to saying that the American commitment to NATO was unshakable. He said the Trump administration’s “commitment to Article 5 remains solid,” referring to NATO’s principle that an attack on one is an attack on all. European diplomats breathed a sigh of relief again, until Mr. Trump held a prolonged and chaotic news conference a few hours later in Washington. “Let’s put it this way, the discrepancy between the president’s news conference and the way his cabinet is trying to reassure Europeans couldn’t be wider,” said Michael Werz, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, who was at the Munich conference. Volker Perthes, the head of SWP, a policy research group based in Germany, said: “Mattis speaks of ‘defending the   international order.’ I hope he can explain this to his boss. ” What appeared to rattle people the most about Mr. Trump’s news conference on Thursday were his attacks on members of the news media assembled before him. Several diplomats said they worried that Mr. Trump was trying to discredit a tenet of American democracy  —   a free press  —   and in so doing, might embolden despots around the world into further challenges to freedom of the press. Struggling to explain how to assess the seeming chaos coming out of Washington, Michael Fallon, Britain’s defense minister, told reporters, “You know, new administrations, you know, can take time to settle down. ” In the crowded lounges and refined tearooms of Munich’s Hotel Bayerischer Hof, where leaders and top officials were mingling, much of the talk on Friday was not about the panels on issues like “the future of the European Union: united or divided,” or “the future of the West: downfall or comeback?” Instead, it was about Mr. Trump’s Thursday news conference, which appeared to deeply unnerve a number of officials. Overheard conversations included one in which one European official said that the United States was now on the list of “risk factors” for Europe, echoing a concern expressed two weeks earlier by Donald Tusk, head of the European Council. German officials joked that American diplomats and civil service organizations could now qualify for German democracy funding  —   money designated for countries with struggling democratic institutions. Several people seemed on edge awaiting what Mr. Mattis would say when he addressed the conference. When he finally approached the lectern, he sounded exactly like numerous other American chiefs who have preceded him. “The   bond remains our strongest bulwark against instability and violence,” he said. “I am confident that we will strengthen our partnerships, confronting those who choose to attack innocent people or our democratic processes and freedoms. ” Mr. Mattis, Mr. Nasr said after the speech, “is the one island of stability. ” But, he added, “the key is that nobody knows the extent of his influence. Right now, we’re tight with   unity, but who knows what to believe?” Ms. Von der Leyen, the German defense minister, used her time at the lectern before Mr. Mattis spoke to deliver a warning to the Trump administration about putting cooperation with Russia ahead of its alliances in Europe  —   or even on the same footing for that matter. “Our American friends know well that your tone on Europe and NATO has a direct impact on the cohesion of our continent,” Ms. Von der Leyen said. “There cannot be a policy of equidistance to allies and to those who openly question our values, our borders and international law. ” Ms. Von der Leyen also criticized Mr. Trump’s efforts to close American borders to refugees from around the world and suspend immigration from several predominantly Muslim countries. (Those efforts have been blocked by American courts.) “We should be careful that this fight does not become a front against Islam and Muslims,” Ms. Von der Leyen said. “Otherwise, we run the risk of digging ourselves into a deeper grave in which violence and terror only grow further. ”	1

324	WASHINGTON  —   The bespectacled teenager in the gray A. C. L. U. hoodie and cargo pants stood, back pressed against a   fence on Pennsylvania Avenue, under a sign saying “No Trespassing, Authorized Personnel Only. ” The White House, illuminated at night, cast a glow over   who, having just wrapped up a protest against President Trump, waited in line to pay homage to    Gavin Grimm. Mr. Grimm looked a little flustered. “Absolutely humbled,” he pronounced himself, as his admirers thanked him for being brave. With Mr. Trump’s decision this week to rescind protections for transgender students that allowed them to use bathrooms corresponding with their gender identity, the next stop is the Supreme Court, where Mr. Grimm  —   an engaging yet slightly awkward young man  —   is the lead plaintiff in a case that could settle the contentious “bathroom debate. ” Amid a thicket of conflicting state laws and local school policies on bathroom use, the suit, which pits Mr. Grimm against his school board in Gloucester County, Va. could greatly expand transgender rights  —   or roll them back. Mr. Trump has portrayed the issue as one of states’ rights, and already the country’s transgender students face differing realities depending on their school. Some are restricted to the bathroom of the gender on their birth certificate. Others are not. Then there are the students like Mr. Grimm, who have had separate facilities set aside for them. At issue in Mr. Grimm’s case is whether Title IX, a provision in a 1972 law that bans discrimination “on the basis of sex” in schools that receive federal money, also bans discrimination based on gender identity. President Barack Obama concluded that it did. Despite Mr. Trump’s action, lawyers for both Mr. Grimm and the school board said Thursday that they expected the case to go forward, with oral arguments set for March 28 and school officials across the country awaiting the result. “No one was in a rush to bring this case to the Supreme Court,” said Joshua Block, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union, which represents Mr. Grimm. “Gavin didn’t choose this fight this fight happened to Gavin. But now that we are here, lives are at stake, and they are at stake in a way that is even more acute because you don’t have a federal government anymore to protect us. ” For Mr. Grimm, who said he knew he was a boy “as soon as I was aware of the difference between boys and girls,” the case amounts to a crash course in government and media relations. It bears his initials, G. G. because he is a minor, and the name of his mother, Deirdre. At home in rural Gloucester, he is a kid with a pet pig named Esmeralda, a geek’s love of Pokémon cards and   Facebook friends. He wears $12 sneakers from Walmart and likes eating at Fuddruckers because the name sounds funny. He is applying for college, but doesn’t want to talk about it. But here in the nation’s capital and in big cities around the country, Mr. Grimm is now a hot property, the new face of the transgender rights movement. Laverne Cox, the actress and activist, gave him a public   at the Grammys. (“Everyone, please Google ‘Gavin Grimm,’” she said.) After his appearance here Wednesday night, he dashed off to New York to appear Thursday morning on ABC’s “The View. ” At the protest here Wednesday night, he was the star speaker, besieged with teary hugs and cellphone selfies. The mother of a transgender child burst into tears when she saw him. A government lawyer shook his hand. Activists posed for pictures. Suddenly, he is hearing his name mentioned in the same breath as Norma McCorvey, the eponymous plaintiff in Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court case that established a national right to abortion (and who died last week) and Jim Obergefell, whose case led to the legalization of   marriage. Mr. Grimm looked   at the thought. “I just hope I do it justice,” he said quietly. When Mr. Grimm was about 12 or 13, he said, he was able to put a name to what he was feeling and recognized himself as transgender. He came out first to his friends, which was easier than telling his parents. For the family, it was a jolt, his mother said. It made her question preachers  —   she eventually left her church  —   but strengthened her faith. “God gave me this child to open my heart and my mind,” Mrs. Grimm, a nurse, said. In 2014, when Mr. Grimm was 15 and starting his sophomore year, the family told his school he was transgender. Administrators were supportive at first and allowed him to use the boys’ bathroom. But amid an uproar from some parents and students, and after two tense school board meetings, the board barred Mr. Grimm from using the boys’ bathrooms and instead adopted a policy requiring transgender youth to use separate “single user” restrooms. The school now has three such restrooms, but two are in refurbished utility closets, said Mr. Block, the A. C. L. U. lawyer. Kyle Duncan, a lawyer for the school board, said the board “agonized” as it sought a thoughtful way to accommodate Mr. Grimm while protecting students who felt uncomfortable. “This is a sensitive and difficult issue in which everyone’s privacy rights need to be respected,” he said. But Mr. Block said that Mr. Grimm had been singled out for “classic sex discrimination. ” Mrs. Grimm was more pointed: “This school board has targeted my child. ” Her son did not always have such aplomb. Before he began “living authentically,” his mother said, he was introverted, often retreating to his room. She winces at the times she tried to curl his hair and make him wear dresses. Mr. Grimm is, by all accounts, the perfect plaintiff, poised beyond his years. He knows how to deflect unwanted lines of questioning (he will not talk about his twin brother, friends or teachers) and is unfailingly polite in replying to intimate queries about his bathroom habits (“If I have to go, I go to the nurse’s restroom,” he told a local television reporter on Wednesday night) and his emotions (“It’s incredibly frustrating, it’s embarrassing, it’s very uncomfortable. I have this neon sign above my head that says I’m different from my peers”). But at heart, he is still a kid. Once, while touring the National Archives here, Mr. Grimm excitedly played Pokémon Go in front of the Declaration of Independence, as Bill Farrar, a spokesman for the A. C. L. U.’s Virginia affiliate, patiently tried to remind him that he was probably “the only person here who has a legal proceeding before the Supreme Court. ” The two have bonded over hours of travel, including a dash from Gloucester to Washington on Wednesday. Mr. Grimm stuffed his belongings in a white trash bag, sticking in a dress shirt at the last minute, which proved handy for “The View. ” Because Mr. Grimm is to graduate this year, it is unlikely that he will benefit if the court finds in his favor. And legal experts say that is a big if. The Supreme Court could rule narrowly, send the case back to the appeals court for further review, or decide to wait until similar suits percolate through the federal court system. And with just eight justices on the court  —   confirmation hearings for Judge Neil M. Gorsuch, Mr. Trump’s nominee for the ninth seat, are scheduled to begin March 20  —   the justices might be inclined to wait. “There are many reasons not to resolve this issue now,” said Carl Tobias, a professor at the University of Richmond School of Law, who has followed the case. But Vanita Gupta, who ran the Civil Rights Division in Mr. Obama’s Justice Department and helped write the directive that Mr. Trump rescinded, said the Grimm case had already advanced the cause of transgender rights, just by raising awareness. “There has been such social and cultural change in the hearts and minds of people in this country,” she said, “and I think that’s only going to grow, even if there is a legal setback. ” Whatever happens, Mr. Grimm appears destined for a life of advocacy. He says he feels a heavy burden standing up for other transgender people, knowing that everyone is different. He worries that other young people will not have the support that he has had. While he is not much on school (he is taking only the two courses he needs to graduate) he would like to be a geneticist. He wants to know how the brain works. But asking him about his career plans brings a   answer  —   wry and pointed. “I want to be,” he said, “someone who doesn’t have to talk about where he is going to use the bathroom. ”	1
235	MIDLAND, Tex.  —   In the land where oil jobs were once a guaranteed road to security for   workers, Eustasio Velazquez’s career has been upended by technology. For 10 years, he laid cables for service companies doing seismic testing in the search for the next big gusher. Then, powerful computer hardware and software replaced cables with wireless data collection, and he lost his job. He found new work connecting pipes on rigs, but lost that job, too, when plunging oil prices in 2015 forced the driller he worked for to replace rig hands with cheaper, more reliable automated tools. “I don’t see a future,” Mr. Velazquez, 44, said on a recent afternoon as he stooped over his shopping cart at a local grocery store. “Pretty soon every rig will have one worker and a robot. ” Oil and gas workers have traditionally had some of the     jobs  —   just the type that President Trump has vowed to preserve and bring back. But the West Texas oil fields, where activity is gearing back up as prices rebound, illustrate how difficult it will be to meet that goal. As in other industries, automation is creating a new demand for   workers  —   sometimes hundreds of miles away in a control center  —   but their numbers don’t offset the ranks of field hands no longer required to sling chains and lift iron. So while there is a general sense of relief in the oil patch that a recovery is gaining momentum, discussions at company meetings and family kitchen tables are rife with aching worries, especially among those who are   with no more than a high school education. Roughly 163, 000 oil jobs were lost nationally from the 2014 peak, or about 30 percent of the total, while oil prices plummeted, at one point by as much as 70 percent. The job losses just in Texas, the most productive   state, totaled 98, 000. Several thousand workers have come back to work in recent months as the price of oil has begun to rise again, but energy experts say that between a third and a half of the workers who lost their jobs are not returning. Many have migrated to construction or even jobs in renewable energy, like wind power. “People have left the industry, and they are not coming back,” said Michael Dynan, vice president for portfolio and strategic development at Schramm, a Pennsylvania manufacturer of drilling rigs. “If it’s a repetitive task, it can be automated, and I don’t need someone to do that. I can get a computer to do that. ” Indeed, computers now direct drill bits that were once directed manually. The wireless technology taking hold across the oil patch allows a handful of geoscientists and engineers to monitor the drilling and completion of multiple wells at a time  —   onshore or miles out to sea  —   and supervise immediate fixes when something goes wrong, all without leaving their desks. It is a world where rigs walk on their own legs and sensors on wells alert headquarters to a leak or loss of pressure, reducing the need for a technician to check. And despite all the lost workers, United States oil production is galloping upward, to nine million barrels a day from 8. 6 million in September. Nationwide, with a bit more than   as many rigs operating as in 2014, production is not even down 10 percent from record levels. Some of the best wells here in the Permian Basin that three years ago required an oil price of over $60 a barrel for an operator to break even now need about $35, well below the current price of about $53. Much of the technology has been developed by the aviation and automotive industries, along with deepwater oil exploration, over more than a decade. But companies drilling on land were slow to adapt until oil prices crashed and companies needed to get efficient quickly or go out of business. All the big companies, and many smaller ones, have organized teams of technicians that collect well and tank data to develop complex algorithms enabling them to duplicate the design for the most productive wells over and over, and to repair valves and other parts before they break down. The result is improved production and safety, but also a far smaller work force, and one that is increasingly morphing from muscle to brain power. Pioneer Natural Resources, one of the most productive West Texas producers, has slashed the number of days to drill and complete wells so drastically that it has been able to cut costs by 25 percent in wells completed since early 2015. The typical rig that drilled eight to 12 wells a year just a few years ago now drills up to 16. Last year, the company added nearly 240 wells to its Permian Basin inventory without adding new employees. The faster operations, Pioneer executives say, are due in large part to more effective well planning and drill steering. Both have been made possible by the   computer connections between the rig and top geoscientists back at corporate headquarters and intense analysis of the data gathered at every well. The laborious task of checking tank levels by climbing a flight of steps and popping open a series of latches, for instance, has been replaced by pressing a few icons on a computer touch screen. A fully automated water pump station installed last summer is intended to save hundreds of truck trips every day hauling water for hydraulically fracturing wells, yielding diesel and labor cost savings. “We want to transform our work force to the point where we need to hire fewer people,” said Joey Hall, Pioneer’s executive vice president for Permian operations. Improved computing streamlines operations, he noted, and lets technicians optimally space their wells and more accurately perforate the sweet spots of shale veins to squeeze every drop of oil out of the ground. “We’re heading toward artificial intelligence and machine learning, analyzing thousands of algorithms,” Mr. Hall added, sounding more like a Silicon Valley futurologist than a wildcatter. “Through repetitive operations, you learn the patterns, and through patterns you learn to make automated decisions. ” With the loss of manual jobs has come a transformation in the job force, with demand growing for more data analysts, math scientists, communications specialists and robotic design engineers. In the last two years, ABB, the Swiss technology company, has opened two plants in Houston for assembling and packaging robotics and integrating advanced instrumentation into oil field operations. GE Oil and Gas opened a technology center in Oklahoma City in October to place scientists closer to the oil fields to research and apply new digital industrial technologies for exploration and production. Among its many projects is an experiment to use drones to inspect equipment and identify methane leaks on oil sites. Nabors, the oil services giant, has 100 employees developing software, 10 times the number it had only a few years ago. “With the adoption of all this   software and stuff, we’ve had to bring in a lot of new technicians,” said Dennis A. Smith, a Nabors vice president. A typical new oil company employee is Andre Nel, a    mechanical engineer who is a rising star at Pioneer Natural Resources. In less than two years, he has helped rewrite computer software to instruct workers on the best designs for hydraulic fracturing, optimizing the amounts of fluids, sand and chemicals pumped into the wells. Now, connected by computers to technicians in the field, he is monitoring the production of 950 wells, instantly checking the maintenance history and production trends of every well with the click of a mouse. “I’m lucky and happy that the tech revolution in the oil field has created the need for engineers like me with backgrounds in computer science,” he said. But smaller companies and their workers are struggling to keep up. S. O. C. Industries, a small local pump truck operator and chemical services provider, is forced to invest $100, 000 a year to keep up with the computer programs and monitoring equipment its clients request. The added expenses are one reason the company has let go 15 of the 60 field workers employed three years ago. Another is that well operators that once hired five or six people on a drill site to mix chemicals and drilling fluids as well as clean up spills are now hiring only three as mechanization has sliced their drilling time in half. Some of the remaining S. O. C. employees are straining to keep up with new computerized pump truck monitors and GPS systems. “It’s a struggle,” said Rodrigo Urias, 59, an S. O. C. truck driver, who for many years only had to look at a needle on a gauge to monitor flow pressures. Now he needs to reset computer screens, take work orders on a computer tablet and sometimes do algebraic calculations. “A lot of the guys can’t operate these new technologies, tablets and instruments, and they keep whining,” he added. “They want to know why we can’t do things like we used to. ” Manufacturing executives say they are trying to minimize the complexity for field workers, and sometimes design their equipment with the advice of video game makers. That’s a good thing for Michael Manga, 34, an employee of Latshaw Drilling, an Oklahoma company active here. A college dropout, he knocked around from job to job before finding his way to the oil patch. Now, playing video games like Call of Duty and Mario Kart with his friends over the years has paid off, giving him the   coordination to monitor and operate the control panels and joy sticks that control the drilling rig. “We do such a good job now,” he said, “we’re drilling ourselves out of a job. ”	1

I got a mortgage and kids to put through college.”“They hired me because I make old, white dudes horny,” Dash told her friend. “Take a look at the other women on FOX News, they all look like models. Hell, I get emails from old white men in the South, saying they never thought of f**king a black woman until they saw me.”“Ann Coulter told me there is good money to be made selling lame books to dumb rednecks,” Dash said. “Like her, I don’t believe half the crap I say.

190	WASHINGTON  —   President Trump, smarting from a series of crises, moved his surrogates aside on Thursday and assigned the rescue of his   presidency to the only spokesman he’s ever really trusted  —   himself. For days, a frustrated and simmering president fumed inside the West Wing residence about what aides said he saw as his staff’s inadequate defense and the ineffectiveness of his own tweets. Over the objections of some top advisers who wanted to steer him away from confrontation, Mr. Trump demanded to face the media, determined to reject the narrative that his administration is sinking into chaos, scandal and incompetence. In a rowdy,    news conference hastily staged in the East Room, Mr. Trump attempted to deflect attention from news coverage about Russian intelligence, the resignation of his national security adviser, the defeat of his labor secretary nominee, and deepening questions about his ability to govern. “I turn on the T. V. open the newspapers and I see stories of chaos,” Mr. Trump said as he attempted  —   with little discipline  —   to read from prepared remarks listing his accomplishments since being inaugurated one month ago. “Chaos. Yet it is the exact opposite. This administration is running like a   machine. ” From there he offered a disjointed and emotional performance in which he appeared to release   anger and suspicion about the “dishonest media,” Democrats, intelligence officials, “criminal” leakers, Hillary Clinton, environmentalists and judges. Taking a room of reporters and the television audience on a journey through the Trump psyche, the president was at times angry (at the news media) playful (“I love this,”) bewildered (by “bias and hatred”) occasionally respectful (“It’s a great honor to be with you”) and needy (“I’m really not a bad person, by the way”). Ever the salesman, Mr. Trump painted his presidency as he wishes it to be: an Electoral College victory so massive it was historic  —   a falsehood pointed out by a reporter in the room  —   plus accomplishments in the first four weeks that have outpaced, he said, every other president. For his supporters, the performance was certain to be energizing. Mr. Trump turned sober questions from journalists into, at times, mesmerizing television. He attempted to reassert his command of “dishonest” journalists at a time when the news media is questioning his capacity to lead. It all made the brooding boss feel better, people close to Mr. Trump said. The news conference, they said, was Mr. Trump’s best effort at spitting the bit out of his mouth and escaping the bridle of the West Wing, where he views his only way to communicate his side of any argument is his   limited Twitter feed. Still, it is unlikely that Mr. Trump’s   performance will divert much   attention from questions about his campaign’s relationship with Russia, or reassure wavering Republicans on Capitol Hill that their agenda is on track. Yet Mr. Trump’s close allies said he had met his more immediate goal of soothing himself with a sense of control over his own administration. Mr. Trump, who has long required employees to sign nondisclosure agreements, has been unnerved, aides said, by leaks big and small, ranging from disclosures about his evenings spent alone in the White House residence to the details of his calls with global leaders. Now, Mr. Trump finds himself at the mercy of a vast, leaky bureaucracy. “The first thing I thought of when I heard about it is: How does the press get this information that’s classified? How do they do it?” Mr. Trump said of the leaks. “The press should be ashamed of themselves. ’’ The news conference was not without its high points for the embattled president. His initial statement about a surge of optimism in the business world and more jobs was, however fleetingly, a focused message on the issue that helped elect him. And he lured a few reporters into a trap of debating the quality of their reporting as opposed to the merits of their original questions. And after complaining to aides about the dour delivery of his press secretary, Sean Spicer, at the daily televised briefing, Mr. Trump laced his own banter with humor. But he also revealed how crushing he is finding the onslaught of criticism that a president receives, saying that he has long preferred the business media to the political press corps he must now deal with. With the same lack of discipline that his supporters on the campaign trail found refreshing, Mr. Trump lashed out at the news media, which he called “out of control. ” He accused The New York Times of publishing what he termed a “discredited” story  —   evidently a reference to an article this week about current and former American officials who say that phone records and intercepted calls show that members of his campaign had repeated contact with senior Russian intelligence officials in the year before the election. He said The Wall Street Journal had published an article that was “almost as disgraceful. ” He mocked Jim Acosta, a CNN correspondent, saying at one point, “Yeah, go ahead, Jimmy. ” His exchange with Mr. Acosta  —   a frequent foil for Mr. Trump in his news conferences on the campaign trail  —   made it clear that the president believes that the American people are with him, and against the news media. “That’s why the public sees it,” Mr. Trump said. “They see it. They see it’s not fair. The public is smart, they understand it. ” Mr. Trump also blamed former President Barack Obama  —   whom he had often described in glowing terms since his inauguration  —   for handing him a failing government. “I inherited a mess,” Mr. Trump asserted. “It’s a mess. At home and abroad, a mess. Low pay, low wages, mass instability overseas, no matter where you look. ” At one point, Mr. Trump searched for a new face among the veteran White House reporters who were challenging him and settled on a journalist wearing a skullcap whom he clearly did not recognize, hoping for the best. “Are you a friendly reporter? ’’ Mr. Trump said. The response of the reporter, Jake Turx of Ami magazine, a Jewish publication, could not be heard in the room. The president’s anger then flared when Mr. Turx asked about a rise in   incidents around the country. Telling Mr. Turx to sit down and accusing him of lying about asking a “very straight, simple question,” Mr. Trump rejected the charge that he is personally    —   something the reporter had explicitly said he was not asserting. At one point, Mr. Trump predicted how the news media would cover the event  —   and preemptively rejected that, too. “Tomorrow, they will say, ‘Donald Trump rants and raves at the press,’” Mr. Trump said. “I’m not ranting and raving. I’m just telling you. You know, you’re dishonest people. But  —   but I’m not ranting and raving. I love this. I’m having a good time doing it. ”	1
687	 Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump announced today his latest initiative to “Make America Great Again!”: Deport all women who have blonde hair and blue eyes.Speaking to a crowd of over 10,000, Trump declared: “Seriously, folks! We’re talking about these women, with their blonde hair and their blue eyes, and they’re biased — they’re twisted — the worst people our country has.”While there was initially no response from his audience (many of whom were looking at each other, waiting to see what the general reaction would be), the majority ultimately ended up erupting in thunderous applause, with a small rebel minority who began booing Trump’s remarks.	0
228	KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia  —   A man from North Korea has been arrested in the assassination of Kim   the estranged half brother of the North Korean leader Kim   the Malaysian police announced Saturday. The man, identified as Ri Jong Chol, 46, was arrested Friday evening, the police said, but they provided no further details. The police had been searching for four men, including at least one North Korean, who they believed had been involved in the attack on Mr. Kim on Monday at Kuala Lumpur International Airport. Two women suspected of being involved in the attack, one from Indonesia and one from Vietnam, were arrested earlier in the week. A Malaysian man, described as the boyfriend of the Indonesian woman, was arrested and is said to be assisting the police in the investigation. On Friday, North Korea broke its silence on Mr. Kim’s assassination, demanding that the Malaysian authorities surrender the body and vowing to reject any   they conducted. The response to the assassination, in a statement by the North Korean ambassador to Malaysia, Kang Chol, also accused the Malaysians of plotting to “besmirch” the North over the killing, heightening tensions between the two countries. The statement was read to reporters outside a Kuala Lumpur hospital where the body of Mr. Kim, 46, has been held since he was attacked on Monday at the airport. The police believe that the assassination was carried out by two women who struck Mr. Kim with a poisoned needle and wiped   poison on his face as he awaited a flight to Macau, where he lives with his family. Indonesia’s national police chief, Tito Karnavian, said Friday that the Indonesian suspect, Siti Aishah, told the Malaysian police that she had thought she was engaged in a prank and had been paid a small amount for her participation. She told the police that she had not realized it was an assassination, he said. South Korean officials have said they suspect that the assassination was ordered by Kim   33, as part of his effort to consolidate power in the reclusive country, run by his family for nearly seven decades. Malaysian news media on Thursday quoted officials as saying that the North Korean government had requested the body. The ambassador’s statement on Friday did not identify the body as that of Kim  . But the statement, quoted by news agencies at the scene, said that the “Malaysian side forced the   without our permission and witnessing” and that “we will categorically reject the result of the   conducted unilaterally excluding our attendance. ” Channel NewsAsia, in its account of the ambassador’s response, quoted him as saying, “We will respond strongly to the moves of the hostile forces towards us with their intent to besmirch the image of our republic by politicizing this incident. ” No relatives of Kim   have come forward from Macau to claim the body. The South China Morning Post, quoting unidentified sources, reported on Friday that the relatives had been placed under police protection in Macau, fearing for their safety.	1

62	SEOUL, South Korea  —   North Korea launched a ballistic missile toward the sea off its eastern coast on Sunday, in what South Korea called the North’s first attempt to test President Trump’s policy on the isolated country. A projectile believed to be a modified version of the North’s   ballistic missile Musudan took off at 7:55 a. m. from Banghyon, a town near North Korea’s northwestern border with China, and flew 310 miles before falling in the sea, the South Korean military said. Earlier, the United States Strategic Command issued a statement identifying the missile as a   or   system that “did not pose a threat to North America. ” South Korea condemned the missile launching, saying that it violated a series of United Nations Security Council resolutions that bar North Korea from developing or testing ballistic missile and nuclear weapons technologies. It also said the North had launched the missile to raise tensions over its weapons programs and to use it as leverage in dealing with the Trump administration. “We see this as part of an attempt by the North to grab attention by demonstrating its nuclear and missile capabilities and to counter the new United States administration’s strong policy line against North Korea,” the South Korean military said in its statement. The missile launch came as Mr. Trump is hosting Japan’s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, on an official visit, but it was unclear if the test was intended as a political message. Mr. Trump and Mr. Abe hastily arranged a joint appearance in response. “North Korea’s most recent missile launch is absolutely intolerable,” Mr. Abe said, calling on the country to comply with all relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions. Looking grim, Mr. Trump said nothing about the missile launch, but pledged to staunchly back Japan. “I just want everybody to understand and fully know that the United States of America stands behind Japan, its great ally, 100 percent,” he said. The two leaders are at    Mr. Trump’s club in Palm Beach, Fla. where they are meeting over the weekend. The United States Strategic Command statement identified the missile North Korea launched as “a   or   ballistic missile. ” “The missile was tracked over North Korea and into the Sea of Japan,” the statement added. “The North American Aerospace Defense Command determined the missile launch from North Korea did not pose a threat to North America. ” South Korea’s Foreign Ministry said the test, the first by the North this year, demonstrated the “maniacal obsession” of the North Korean leader, Kim   with developing a   ballistic missile. The test came less than two days after Mr. Trump said on Friday that defending against the nuclear and missile threats from North Korea was a “very, very high priority. ” Mr. Trump made the comment at a news conference with Mr. Abe at the White House. In their joint statement, the two leaders had urged North Korea “to abandon its nuclear and ballistic missile programs and not to take any further provocative actions. ” The test of an   system would have been especially provocative because it would mean that North Korea was trying to develop the ability to strike the United States. South Korean officials said they believed that the North has been using the Musudan, its   missile, to develop and test some intercontinental ballistic missile, or ICBM, technologies. North Korea has deployed and often tested   Scud and midrange Rodong ballistic missiles that can reach most of South Korea and Japan, but it has had a spotty record in   the Musudan, its only missile with a range long enough to reach American military bases in the Pacific, including those on Guam. North Korea’s last Musudan test ended in failure in October. In a New Year’s Day speech, Mr. Kim said his country had reached a “final stage” in preparing to conduct its first test of an ICBM. That drew a Twitter post the next day from Mr. Trump that said, “It won’t happen!” North Korea has since warned that it could   an ICBM “anytime and anywhere,” in its first challenge to the new American president. The American defense secretary, Jim Mattis, visited South Korea on his first official trip abroad and agreed with South Korea to boost the allies’ joint defense abilities against North Korea. The two allies also agreed to push ahead with their plan to deploy an advanced American missile defense system known as Thaad in South Korea by the end of the year, despite a strong protest from China. Although North Korea has vowed to develop the ability to attack the United States with nuclear warheads and has tested missiles that can reach throughout the Korean Peninsula and its vicinity, it has never tested a   missile that could fly across the Pacific. It remains unclear how close North Korea has come to building a reliable ICBM, although it has boasted of successfully testing crucial technologies in the past year, such as   missile engines and heat shields for an ICBM.	1
513	 The Obama Administration announced immediate measures to prevent a repeat of the attack in Nice, France, in which a French Tunisian radicalized by years of mistreatment in France, drove a truck down the Promenade des Anglais into a crowd watching Bastille Day fireworks, killing 84 people and injuring 303.“Effective immediately, and in view of the terrible tragedy in Nice, my Administration will impose strict truck controls on everyone in the United States,” said President Obama. “Today, I have issued an executive order requiring an extensive FBI background check on anyone attempting to buy or use a truck. The purchaser will have to fill out a lengthy application explaining why he needs a truck, and the application will limit the number of wheels that the truck can have.” Presidential press secretary Josh Earnest clarified that any buyer wanting to acquire, rent or use a truck with more than 4 wheels would have to submit to an additional background check. He added that the definition of wheel falling under this limit includes both a steering wheel and any tires. Earnest explained, “The President imposed an executive order because the attack in France demonstrates that an immediate danger to the American people exists, one that cannot wait for the Republican-dominated Congress to act.”	0

268	Richard Schickel, who was so captivated by Walt Disney’s “Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs” when he was 5 years old that he grew up to be a noted film critic, Hollywood historian and prolific author and documentarian  —   and estimated that he had watched 22, 590 movies  —   died on Saturday in Los Angeles. He was 84. His daughter Erika Schickel said the cause was complications of dementia. Fortified by boxes of Good  Plenty licorice rather than popcorn, Mr. Schickel reviewed films for Life magazine from 1965 until it closed in 1972, then wrote for Time until 2010 and later for the blog Truthdig. com. In a career that spanned the   studio era and the rise of independent directors, he also wrote 37 books on movies and filmmakers and wrote or directed more than 30 documentaries, mostly for television. He shared or received three Emmy nominations, for “Life Goes to the Movies” in 1976 and “Minnelli on Minnelli: Liza Remembers Vincente” in 1987. Richard Zoglin, a fellow critic and now a contributing editor at Time, said that what distinguished Mr. Schickel among his peers was his comprehensive knowledge of the movie industry’s players and processes coupled with “an astute critical sensibility” that resisted the trendy. “He wrote from the perspective of a film insider,” Mr. Zoglin said in a phone interview, “but responded to films from a gut level and never lost the sense of being an average filmgoer reacting to what was on the screen. ” Mr. Schickel pulled no punches. Reviewing Stanley Kramer’s “Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner” in 1967, the interracial love story starring Sidney Poitier, Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy, Mr. Schickel groused, “Kramer is earnestly preaching away on matters that have long ceased to be true issues. ” He even dismissed “The Maltese Falcon,” John Huston’s 1941 film noir classic starring Humphrey Bogart, as “cramped and static” and was damning in a retrospective look at “Gone With the Wind” in The Atlantic in 1973. Mr. Schickel wrote that two measures of a movie’s quality should be how much a viewer retains and how much one wants to see it again. By both measures, he loved “Citizen Kane,” “Double Indemnity,” “The Godfather,” “The Searchers,” “Chinatown,” “Fargo,” “Meet Me in St. Louis,” “Yankee Doodle Dandy,” “Pinocchio” and the original “King Kong,” as well as outliers like Audie Murphy’s western “No Name on the Bullet” and François Truffaut’s “The 400 Blows. ” Mr. Schickel did not view filmgoing as an experience frozen in memory. “You loved ‘My Friend Flicka’ when you saw it at age 10,” he wrote. “If you see it at age 65, you may respect it, but you won’t think it’s a masterpiece (which does not mean you should deprive your grandchildren of the pleasure of seeing this picture when they are the perfect age for it). ” He also understood that the public’s perception of his role had evolved. A critic, he told The Hedgehog Review in 2005, is “a very endangered species in a nation that wants indulgence more than a criticism that questions its fatuity. ” But responding to an article in The New York Times, which suggested that blogging might be making book reviewing more democratic, he wrote in The Los Angeles Times in 2007: “Criticism  —   and its humble cousin, reviewing  —   is not a democratic activity. It is, or should be, an elite enterprise, ideally undertaken by individuals who bring something to the party beyond their hasty, instinctive opinions of a book (or any other cultural object). It is work that requires disciplined taste, historical and theoretical knowledge and a fairly deep sense of the author’s (or filmmaker’s or painter’s) entire body of work, among other qualities. ” Richard Warren Schickel was born on Feb. 10, 1933, in Milwaukee, the son of Edward Schickel, who worked in advertising, and the former Helen Hendricks, a docent. He was named for an ancestor, Richard Warren, who arrived on the Mayflower. He was raised in suburban Wauwatosa, Wis. and escaped to the movies on weekends with friends, he wrote in a memoir, “Good Morning, Mr. Zip Zip Zip: Movies, Memory, and World War II” (2003) “because the serene and placid little world I inhabited as a kid was so lacking in romantic and heroic adventure. ” He saw Charlie Chaplin’s “The Great Dictator” when he was 8. “I mimed enchantment for my parents’ benefit,” he wrote in American Heritage magazine in 2006. “I did a lot of that in those days. They were so sweetly earnest, as I now appreciatively recall, about introducing me to ‘the finer things.’ Their problem back then was finding, in Milwaukee, finer things for me to appreciate. ” Mr. Schickel graduated from the University of Wisconsin, Madison, in 1955 with a bachelor’s degree in political science and moved to New York, where he freelanced for magazines and reviewed his first film, “A Boy Ten Feet Tall,” starring Edward G. Robinson, in 1965. He described it as “quite a good little movie. ” His marriage to Julia Carroll Whedon, a writer, ended in divorce. In addition to their daughter Erika, who is also a writer, he is survived by another daughter from that marriage, Jessica Vild a stepdaughter, Ali Rubinstein, from his second marriage, to the former Carol Rubinstein, a TV producer who died in 1991 and four grandchildren. His books included biographies of Woody Allen, Marlon Brando, James Cagney, Charlie Chaplin, Gary Cooper, Clint Eastwood, Lena Horne and Elia Kazan. His documentaries include a PBS series, “The Men Who Made the Movies. ” “The truth, very simply, is that most movies are lousy or, at best, routine,” Mr. Schickel wrote in “Keepers: The Greatest Films  —   and Personal Favorites  —   of a Moviegoing Lifetime” (2015). “We go to see them, much of the time, in search of something else  —   the comforting darkness of the theater, the play of light and shadow on the screen, the consolations they offer for some temporary trouble,” he wrote. “A lot of the time we don’t give a hoot what’s playing. We are at a public event for private reasons which we don’t always recognize until later, if at all. It is the occasion, the atmosphere, that we crave. ”	1

4	PHOENIX  —   For eight years, Guadalupe García de Rayos had checked in at the federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement office here, a requirement since she was caught using a fake Social Security number during a raid in 2008 at a water park where she worked. Every year since then, she has walked in and out of the meetings after a brief review of her case and some questions. But not this year. On Wednesday, immigration agents arrested Ms. Rayos, 35. Despite efforts by her family and others who tried to block, legally and physically, her removal from the United States, she was deported Thursday to Nogales, Mexico, the same city where she crossed into the United States 21 years ago. Immigration agents “said she’s a threat, but my wife isn’t a threat,” her husband said in an interview. As one of the estimated 11 million unauthorized immigrants in the United States, Ms. Rayos was always a candidate for deportation, but as a matter of practicality, the Obama administration had focused its finite resources on removing the most serious criminals. The government even won a deportation order against Ms. Rayos in 2013, but had not carried it out, instead merely requiring her to check in periodically. That all changed under President Trump, who ran on a pledge of being tougher on illegal immigration. Among the 18 executive orders that he has issued since taking office on Jan. 20 is one stipulating that undocumented immigrants convicted of any criminal offense  —   and even those who have not been charged but are believed to have committed “acts that constitute a chargeable criminal offense”  —   have become a priority for deportation. Immigrants’ rights advocates say the new order could easily apply to a majority of unauthorized immigrants in the United States. “We’re living in a new era now, an era of war on immigrants,” Ms. Rayos’s lawyer, Ray A. Ybarra Maldonado, said Wednesday after leaving the building here that houses the federal immigration agency, known by its acronym, ICE. But groups supporting Mr. Trump’s moves on illegal immigration say that the deportations were long overdue, and would stop unauthorized immigrants from taking jobs from citizens, even if it meant that painful deportations would be taking place more often. “It’s easy to put a human face on this one woman,” said Ira Mehlman, spokesman for the Federation for American Immigration Reform, adding that he was not opining on the merits of Ms. Rayos’s case. “We can’t precisely pinpoint who the person or people are who might not have gotten a job taken by a person or people here illegally,” he said. “The general principle was we hold the people who violate the laws responsible for the consequences that accrue to other people. ” In a statement Thursday, Yasmeen Pitts O’Keefe, a spokeswoman for ICE, noted Ms. Rayos’s previous felony conviction and deportation order. Ms. Rayos’s “immigration case underwent review at multiple levels of the immigration court system, including the Board of Immigration Appeals, and the judges held she did not have a legal basis to remain in the U. S.,” Ms. O’Keefe said. “ICE will continue to focus on identifying and removing individuals with felony convictions who have final orders of removal issued by the nation’s immigration courts. ” Lawyers from two of the nation’s leading civil rights’ groups said Ms. Rayos might be the first unauthorized immigrant to be arrested during a scheduled meeting with immigration officials since Mr. Trump took office. Ms. Rayos was 14 when she left Acambaro, a city in an impoverished corner of the Mexican state of Guanajuato, and sneaked across the border into Nogales, Ariz. a   drive from Phoenix. She married  —   her husband is also undocumented, and thus did not want his name published  —   and gave birth to a boy and a girl, who are now in their teens. Ms. Rayos was working at Golfland Sunsplash in Mesa, a suburb of Phoenix, when Maricopa County sheriff’s deputies swooped in on Dec. 16, 2008, arresting her and several other employees on charges of suspicion of identity theft and using forged documents to obtain employment. The raid was one of the first ordered by Joe Arpaio, who was sheriff at the time, under an Arizona law authorizing sanctions against employers who knowingly hired undocumented immigrants. She spent three months in a county jail, followed by three months in immigration detention, she told a reporter. In 2013, an immigration court ordered that she be sent back to Mexico, but her case had been on hold since the federal authorities  —   under the Obama administration  —   decided not to act on the deportation order. Her son, Angel, still remembers the evening of her arrest  —   the knock on the door, the flashlight on the darkened living room, the sight of handcuffs on his mother’s wrists. “I was in second grade,” he said. “I never forgot that night, and I’ve lived in fear of losing my mother every night since then. ” Ms. Rayos was afraid to go to her appointment on Wednesday, knowing what might happen. Carlos Garcia, executive director of Puente, an immigrants’ rights group, told her she could skip it and go into hiding or seek refuge at a church in North Phoenix, joining two other unauthorized immigrants facing deportation who have lived there for months. She decided to face the odds. Before her appointment, Ms. Rayos and her family attended Mass. Later, she stopped for a moment, clasped her hands and bowed her head, as if she were reciting a silent prayer. “I have faith in God,” Ms. Rayos said, pinching her forehead and trying not to cry. She walked toward the gates that surround the ICE building, followed by Mr. Garcia and a small army of Puente volunteers, the same group that staged numerous protests against Mr. Arpaio at the height of his pursuit of unauthorized immigrants. The volunteers chanted, “No estás sola,” Spanish for “you are not alone. ” When it became clear that Ms. Rayos would not walk out of the building, the protesters were ready. As a van carrying Ms. Rayos left the ICE building Wednesday, they surrounded it, chanting, “Liberation, not deportation. ” Her daughter, Jacqueline, joined in, holding a sign that read, “Not one more deportation. ” One man, Manuel Saldana, tied himself to one of the van’s front wheels and said, “I’m going to stay here as long as it takes. ” Soon, police officers in helmets had surrounded Mr. Saldana. They cut off the ties holding him to the tire and rounded up at least six others who were blocking the front and back of the van, arresting them all. The driver quickly put the van in reverse and rolled back inside the building. Ms. Rayos was one of several detainees inside the van. Later, a vehicle was seen leaving the building under police escort, and her husband said he suspected she might have been inside. On Thursday, Ms. Rayos’s husband and children received a call from her, telling them she was in Nogales, Mexico, just south of the Arizona border. His daughter had stayed with protesters until long past midnight. By sunrise, she was back home, packing her mother’s suitcase  —   her toothpaste, her brush, her favorite pants and shirts. “Nobody should have to pack her mother’s bag,” she said, her lips quivering, tears filling her eyes. “It isn’t fair. ”	1

790	 Colorado McDonald’s Offers First Marijuana Friendly Smoking Section In Restaurant. Is this true? 15 Colorado McDonald franchises have announced that they are converting their McDonald’s Play Place areas into marijuana friendly smoking areas. Each facility will consist of 15 smoking pods in which customers can smoke a joint, bong, or pipe without being harassed or bothered by people who are offended by it.Each pod not only contains the marijuana smoke within it’s small space, but also it repels the smell of the marijuana through a ventilation tube above the pod. So, although the doors are sealed in this previous “Play Place” location, the smell of marijuana will not seep into the main restaurant as people enter and exit the facility.  	0
995	 Actress Sandra Bullock to Hillary Clinton: ‘If You Don’t Like Our President You Can Leave and Never Come Back Again, You Are One Jealous Woman Who is Nothing to Compare With Trump, I Hope He Will Arrest You Soon.’ Do You Support Her? One politician who seemingly won’t get the star’s vote in the 2016 presidential election? Donald Trump.“I don’t agree with that at all,” Bullock said of the candidate’s comments on Mexican-Americans. “That was not a statement that I can get behind. I don’t agree with that statement.” Sandra Bullock stated that she is not “politically vocal” but rather that doesn’t mean she isn’t stubborn with regards to America’s administration. “I simply need what’s best for our nation,” Bullock said amid a question and answer session for her new film, Our Brand Is Crisis, in Los Angeles last Friday. And the best part was when she stated this:“If you don’t like our current President, you can leave our country and never come back, especially you Hillary.”“Hatred is the last thing we need nowadays, we must unite. Donald Trump is doing everything he is available of to improve our nation, just respect that activity and stay patient.”	0
43	The 59th annual Grammy Awards on Sunday will feature perhaps the show’s most electric contest in years: Adele versus Beyoncé. Both are megaselling queens of pop whose every move reverberates throughout the culture. The fact that they will face off in each of the top three categories  —   album, record and song of the year  —   gives the Grammys a rare tension that can only be good for ratings. Yet their competition is also fraught in ways that have long dogged the awards. One concerns race, a subject the Grammys have a tangled history with  —   especially this year, when one of the most acclaimed young black artists, Frank Ocean, has boycotted the process altogether. Another sensitive area is the Grammys’ spotty record in recognizing the vanguards of contemporary pop. Added to the mix is a heightened political climate in which issues of race and identity are front and center, raising the question of whether the music industry will use this year’s Grammys as a soapbox. Many longtime Grammy watchers say that a sweep by Adele  —   and therefore a Beyoncé snub  —   could feed into   complaints that the awards too often fail to recognize black performers in the most prestigious categories. Ebro Darden, a disc jockey on the New York   station Hot 97 and on Apple’s Beats 1, said that a big Beyoncé win would be “the best move” for the Grammys “if they want to get the most attention and keep people interested. ” Should Adele dominate, he added, some music fans “would come for them and say #OscarsSoWhite. ” With the news media closely focused on diversity at awards shows  —   and the public relations nightmares that result from an absence of it  —   that would be an unwelcome response for the Recording Academy, the organization behind the Grammys. (A representative for the academy declined to comment.) Adele and Beyoncé are both hailed in music circles as supremely deserving talents. But for voters, the singers also represent a choice between two strains of modern pop: Adele’s album “25” and her hit ballad “Hello” are examples of the finely   traditional style that is Grammy catnip. Beyoncé’s “Lemonade,” with its dynamic single “Formation” and accompanying politically and racially charged hourlong art film, represents an edgier    sound that rarely takes the top prize  —   Exhibit A for those who contend that the Grammys are perennially out of touch. Beyoncé’s own example is telling: She may already have 20 Grammys on her shelf, but only one is in the   big four categories (album, record and song of the year, or best new artist). She has also been passed over twice for album of the year, losing to Taylor Swift in 2010 and Beck in 2015 (much to the consternation of Kanye West, a frequent Grammy critic). “The #OscarsSoWhite controversy really shook the motion picture academy, and I think the Grammys are saying, ‘There but for the grace of God go we, so let’s make sure this doesn’t happen to us,’” said Paul Grein, a former Billboard columnist who performs detailed Grammy analysis for the industry magazine Hits. The Grammys may be more diverse than most shows this year, Beyoncé is the top nominee, with nine nods, while the newcomer Chance the Rapper has seven. But the show’s record in recognizing black talent has come under plenty of fire. Mr. Ocean declined to submit his work for consideration in this year’s Grammys at all, saying that the institution “just doesn’t seem to be representing very well for people who come from where I come from,” and calling the boycott his “Colin Kaepernick moment. ” Rap fans were outraged when Kendrick Lamar lost best rap album to the white rapper Macklemore in 2014, though Mr. Lamar took all four rap trophies last year. (Eminem has won best rap album six times.) The last black artists to win album of the year were legacy picks: Ray Charles in 2005, and Herbie Hancock, covering Joni Mitchell, in 2008 a black woman hasn’t won since Lauryn Hill did nearly two decades ago. Russell Simmons, the entertainment mogul who is a founder of Def Jam Recordings, said that Beyoncé “is overdue for being accepted by the mainstream in the way she deserves. ” “She’s obviously the most mainstream thing on the planet,” Mr. Simmons said. He added: “When they define her, her color has something to do with the way she’s viewed and the amount of awards she wins and the accolades she gets. I would venture to say were she white and blond from Texas, she would be recognized differently. ” Some, however, reject the idea of the   contest as a referendum on race. “I don’t think it’s a black and white thing it’s a quality thing,” said Joel Peresman, the chief executive of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Foundation. Kevin Liles, a veteran record executive now with 300 Entertainment, said that the Grammys had evolved in recent years: “If it was truly a dormant or stagnant association, then Beyoncé wouldn’t be there. All shapes, sizes, colors and genres are represented. ” The odds on Adele and Beyoncé are hard to read, even among industry insiders. Adele may be a safe choice, but she also swept all three top prizes five years ago, making a repeat seem unlikely. No   or contemporary RB album has won the top prize since Outkast’s “  Love Below” in 2004, a tough precedent for Beyoncé on the other hand, there is a wide sense in the industry that it may simply be her turn. At the Grammys, however, anything is possible: Contenders for an upset album of the year winner are streaming hits like Drake’s “Views” and Justin Bieber’s “Purpose,” and this year’s darkest horse, “A Sailor’s Guide to Earth” by the country outsider Sturgill Simpson. The awards   also comes at a cultural crossroads, following a divisive presidential election. Now, even the most mainstream events are weighted with ideological expectations. “The gloves are off: It is absolutely in style to have a political opinion right now,” the D. J. Mr. Darden said, predicting that the Grammys would “absolutely have that moment” where current events come up, such as with Meryl Streep’s Golden Globes speech aimed at President Trump. Lady Gaga, a vocal Hillary Clinton supporter, did not make a grand political statement, as some had hoped, at the Super Bowl, but she will have another platform when she performs with Metallica at the Grammys. Among the other performers scheduled on Sunday are Katy Perry, who was a dedicated surrogate for Mrs. Clinton, and Chance the Rapper, a frequent guest of President Obama’s White House. Beyoncé and Adele, who is British, both expressed support for Mrs. Clinton last year. “We want to be a place where artists can feel they can come and express themselves,” Ken Ehrlich, the Grammys producer, said of the possibility that performances or speeches could become political. “Our guidelines are taste and the F. C. C. The F. C. C. is more concerned with profanity than it is with political discourse. ” Mr. Simmons said that no matter who comes away the night’s big winner, a foray by a major artist into politics would be a boon for the show. “If Trump says the Grammys are overrated on Monday morning, people will go looking for what he’s talking about,” Mr. Simmons said. “I hope he does. ”	1
34	At least six members of the Super   New England Patriots have said they will not visit the White House for the traditional meeting that championship teams have with the president. Running back LeGarrette Blount, defensive end Chris Long and defensive tackle Alan Branch on Thursday became the latest to announce that they would skip the visit. Long posted on Twitter that he “planned on skipping” in response to a column in The Daily News that urged him to skip. Blount revealed his decision on Fox Sports in a radio interview on “The Rich Eisen Show” later in the afternoon. “I just don’t feel welcome in that house,” Blount said. “I’m going to just leave it at that. ” Branch told Sirius XM Radio that he planned to spend time with family. A day earlier, the Pro Bowl linebacker Dont’a Hightower bowed out when he told ESPN, “Been there, done that,” having visited with a championship Alabama team. Tight end Martellus Bennett told reporters after the Super Bowl that he would not go: “It is what it is,” he said. “People know how I feel about it. Just follow me on Twitter. ” The outspoken Bennett had joked that he might move to outer space after Donald J. Trump was elected. The Pro Bowl safety Devin McCourty, a team captain,  told Time magazine: “Basic reason for me is I don’t feel accepted in the White House. With the president having so many strong opinions and prejudices, I believe certain people might feel accepted there while others won’t. ” Bennett and McCourty were in the news for their activism last fall, when they raised their fists in protest during the national anthem for one game. At the time, athletes in various sports were protesting racial oppression in the country. The number of Patriots absences may well increase. Running back James White said he had not made up his mind whether to go. “I’ll wait till the time comes and decide then,” he said. No date has been scheduled for this year’s ceremony honoring the Patriots. The ceremony for last year’s champions, the Broncos, took place in June. Perhaps no other team has as close an association with Trump as the Patriots. Just before the election, Trump claimed that he had the support of Patriots quarterback Tom Brady and Coach Bill Belichick. Brady, who displayed a “Make America Great Again” cap in his locker during the campaign, never explicitly endorsed Trump, but he spoke favorably of him and they have socialized. Trump also cited a supportive letter he had received from Belichick, and several news media accounts confirmed the letter was authentic. The team’s owner, Robert K. Kraft, has said he has considered Trump a longtime friend. Brady did not attend his team’s visit with former President Barack Obama at the White House, in 2015, citing family issues. But some athletes who have skipped the trip over the years have explicitly given politics as a reason. Bruins goalie Tim Thomas declined to visit the Obama White House with his teammates in January 2012, saying in a statement: “I believe the federal government has grown out of control, threatening the rights, liberties and property of the people. “Because I believe this, today I exercised my right as a free citizen, and did not visit the White House. ” Baltimore Ravens center Matt Birk cited his opposition to abortion as the reason for skipping a 2013 visit. A number of other athletes have skipped the ceremony while citing scheduling conflicts or family commitments. Presidents for years have invited sports figures to the White House, but the tradition of honoring championships teams there solidified under Ronald Reagan. Major professional champions and many college champions stop by for a presentation and a photo opportunity. Six Patriots, so far, won’t make the trip this year.	1
325	Nearly 150, 000 American teenagers from 13 to 17 years old  —   or one out of every 137  —   would identify as transgender if survey takers asked, according to an analysis of state and federal data that offers an answer to a question that has long eluded researchers. The figure stands to inform the fierce debate over the rights of transgender youth, reignited on Wednesday by President Trump’s decision to rescind an Obama administration policy that protected the rights of students to use bathrooms corresponding to their gender identity. The estimate may also help lawmakers and advocates across the country better understand the populations they serve. “We want to make sure that policy debates are informed by actual figures,” said Jody L. Herman, a scholar of public policy at the Williams Institute at the U. C. L. A. School of Law, where she and several   published the estimate in a report last month. That report, the latest in a series on transgender populations, included estimates of the transgender population in each state and in different age groups. In addition to an estimated 149, 750 transgender teenagers nationwide, accounting for 0. 7 percent of the population ages 13 to 17, Dr. Herman and her   estimated that there are 1. 4 million transgender adults in the United States. In the younger age group, transgender identification is probably more common among the older teenagers than the younger ones, they said. The Williams Institute, well regarded for its research on lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender issues, was frequently cited during the   marriage debate for its findings on the positive economic impact of allowing the practice. It also published a widely accepted estimate of the national L. G. B. T. population six years ago. In the January report, the researchers estimated that 22, 200 teenagers in California, 13, 800 in Texas and 9, 750 in New York would identify as transgender if asked. North Dakota and Wyoming were home to the smallest populations of transgender teenagers, estimated at just 200 each. Proportionally, however, Hawaii and West Virginia took the lead, with about 1 in 100 teenagers from 13 to 17 estimated to be transgender. In Connecticut and Iowa, the transgender share of that age group was projected to be much smaller, about 1 in 250. The analysis, an extrapolation based on adult responses to a federal survey, represents an indirect way of arriving at a figure that many advocates consider to be of crucial importance. ”It’s not about what your gut tells you, it’s not about what the news last night told you, it’s not about what you think you might have gathered from looking at a couple of internet websites,” said Kellan Baker, a senior fellow at the liberal Center for American Progress who specializes in L. G. B. T. and health issues. “It’s about what do the data actually say, so that we can target resources where they will do the most good. ” While the federal government collects a wide variety of detailed demographic information about the population, good, consistent data on sexual orientation and gender identity is lacking. “We just don’t have that same level of information readily accessible,” said Sandy James, survey project manager for the National Center for Transgender Equality. The Williams Institute estimates are based on a large Centers for Disease Control and Prevention survey known as the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. In addition to a core set of questions asked nationally, the C. D. C. allows states to choose from several optional questions to ask their residents. One such option, selected by about half the states in 2015 and slightly fewer in 2014, inquired about transgender identity. More than 150, 000 people answered the question each year. With that in hand, the researchers applied an advanced statistical technique regarded by some academics as an emerging gold standard for making state estimates using national data, based on   demographic and geographic patterns. The researchers extended the findings of the survey to all 50 states, after accounting for differences in race, age, education, income and religion. The C. D. C. surveys only adults, but the authors used trends among older age groups to estimate the number of teenagers who would identify as transgender if asked. There has been no authoritative,   questioning of teenagers about transgender identity. While the C. D. C. surveys children about gender identity, it asks only how they express gender in terms of masculinity and femininity, and the question is posed in a limited number of places, Dr. Herman said. Large, national surveys are also typically slow to change, in order to maintain consistent, comparable data over long periods of time. “This series of reports is our best attempt to use the best available data and the best methodology,” Dr. Herman said.	1
774	 A Florida couple Ray “Paw Paw” Tate and his girlfriend Selma B. Withers have been arrested on over twenty counts of fraud this past weekend after a gentleman went to go visit some land Tate had sold him on-line. “I put the address into my GPS and it took me to a point where I couldn’t go any further. I was just stuck driving in a circle,” said the man who thought he was getting a deal on some Florida swampland.As it turned out, the land Tate and Withers was selling was not in Florida. In fact, it wasn’t in the United States. It wasn’t even overseas. Tate and Withers were selling prime real estate in the Aitken Military Base located on the moon, a real estate scam Tate and Withers had concocted while high on bath salts presumably in order to buy more bath salts.

384	KABUL, Afghanistan  —   At least 10 police officers and the wife of a police commander were killed in an ambush by Islamic State militants in the northern province of Zawzjan, a provincial official said on Saturday. Mohammad Reza Ghafori, a spokesman for the Zawzjan provincial governor, said that the police officers were ambushed Friday as they left a mosque. The wife of the police commander heard about her husband being shot and rushed to the scene, where she was also killed. Militants linked to the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, have been active in Afghanistan’s eastern regions, but have recently begun operating in the north of the country as well. The Interior Ministry said in a statement that around 38 militants, including 23 Islamic State fighters, were killed in separate operations conducted by Afghan security forces in the eastern and southern regions of the country over the past two days. Eight other militants were wounded and six were arrested in the operations, which were conducted in districts across the Nangarhar and Helmand provinces, the statement added. In Laghman Province, in the east, two students were killed when a mortar shell struck a school classroom, a news release from the Education Ministry said. The statement said that five other students were wounded inside the classroom in Mihterlam, the province’s capital. There were unconfirmed reports that the mortar was fired by Afghan security forces and missed its target and hit the school. The report could not immediately be verified by provincial or government officials.	1
350	Recently I had a conversation with a chief executive who expressed concern about several of her senior managers. They were smart, experienced, competent. So what was the problem? “They’re not asking enough questions,” she said. This wouldn’t have been a bad thing in the business world of a few years ago, where the rules for success were: Know your job, do your work, and if a problem arises, solve it and don’t bother us with a lot of questions. But increasingly I’m finding that business leaders want the people working around them to be more curious, more cognizant of what they don’t know, and more inquisitive  —   about everything, including “Why am I doing my job the way I do it?” and “How might our company find new opportunities?” I may be   of this trend because I think of myself as a “questionologist,” having studied the art of questioning and written a book about it. But I also think there are real forces in business today that are causing people to value curiosity and inquiry more than in the past. Companies in many industries today must contend with rapid change and rising uncertainty. In such conditions, even a   company cannot rest on its expertise there is pressure to keep learning what’s new and anticipating what’s next. It’s hard to do any of that without asking questions. Steve Quatrano, a member of the Right Question Institute, a nonprofit research group, explains that the act of formulating questions enables us “to organize our thinking around what we don’t know. ” This makes questioning a good skill to hone in dynamic times. Asking questions can help spark the innovative ideas that many companies hunger for these days. In the research for my book, I studied business breakthroughs  —   including the invention of the Polaroid instant camera and the Nest thermostat and the genesis of   like Netflix, Square and Airbnb  —   and found that in each case, some curious soul looked at a current problem and asked insightful questions about why that problem existed and how it might be tackled. The Polaroid story is my favorite: The inspiration for the instant camera sprang from a question asked in the   by the    daughter of its inventor, Edwin H. Land. She was impatient to see a photo her father had just snapped, and when he tried to explain that the film had to be processed first, she wondered aloud, “Why do we have to wait for the picture?” One might assume that people can easily ask such questions, given that children do it so well. But research shows that   peaks at age 4 or 5 and then steadily drops off, as children pass through school (where answers are often more valued than questions) and mature into adults. By the time we’re in the workplace, many of us have gotten out of the habit of asking fundamental questions about what’s going on around us. And some people worry that asking questions at work reveals ignorance or may be seen as slowing things down. So how can companies encourage people to ask more questions? There are simple ways to train people to become more comfortable and proficient at it. For example, question formulation exercises can be used as a substitute for conventional brainstorming sessions. The idea is to put a problem or challenge in front of a group of people and instead of asking for ideas, instruct participants to generate as many relevant questions as they can. Kristi Schaffner, an executive at Microsoft, regularly conducts such exercises there and says they sharpen analytical skills. Getting employees to ask more questions is the easy part getting management to respond well to those questions can be harder. When leaders claim they want “everyone to ask more questions,” I sometimes (in my bolder moments) ask: “Do you really want that? And what will you do with those questions once people start asking them?” For questioning to thrive in a company, management must find ways to reward the behavior  —   if only by acknowledging the good questions that have been asked. For example, I visited one company that asked all employees to think of “what if” and “how might we” questions about the company’s goals and plans. Management and employees together decided which of these mission questions were best, then displayed them on banners on the walls. Leaders can also encourage companywide questioning by being more curious and inquisitive themselves. This is not necessarily easy for senior executives, who are used to being the ones with the answers. I’ve noticed during questioning exercises at some companies that top executives sit in the back of the room, laptops open, attending to other business they seem to think their employees are the only ones who need to learn. As they do this, these leaders are modeling precisely the kind of incurious behavior they’re trying to change in others. They could set a better example by asking “why” and “what if”  —   while asking others to do likewise. And as the questions proliferate, some good answers are likely to follow.	1
583	 29-year old Joaquín Álvarez Santos, from Chiclayo in Peru, was shooting underwater images on the pygmy sperm whale with four other divers, when the giant predator appeared.The massive creature, probably weighting more than 2000 kg (4400 lbs), immediately headed towards the cameraman and effortlessly swallowed him before swimming away.

170	WASHINGTON  —   Moving quickly after his first choice for labor secretary withdrew his nomination amid controversy, President Trump made a seemingly safe selection on Thursday in R. Alexander Acosta, a Florida law school dean and former assistant attorney general. In Mr. Acosta, Mr. Trump has chosen a nominee with deep experience in labor relations, law and education. The pick answers concerns about the lack of diversity in the Trump administration, in that Mr. Acosta would be the first Hispanic in the president’s cabinet. And his chances of being confirmed appear relatively high, since Mr. Acosta, currently the dean of Florida International University’s law school, has made it through the Senate process three times for different roles. “Alex is going to be a key part of achieving our goal of revitalizing the American economy, manufacturing and labor force,” Mr. Trump said as he called on the Senate to confirm Mr. Acosta swiftly. A Miami native, Mr. Acosta’s most relevant experience to the job of labor secretary is his time at the National Labor Relations Board, where he was a member from 2002 to 2003, under President George W. Bush. Mr. Bush later tapped Mr. Acosta to be assistant attorney general for the Justice Department’s civil rights division, one of the highest positions at the agency. He went on to become the United States attorney for the Southern District of Florida, where his office prosecuted the lobbyist Jack Abramoff, the terrorism suspect Jose Padilla and founders of the Cali cartel. He achieved the conviction of Charles Taylor Jr. the son of Liberia’s former leader, for torture. His official biography said his office also prosecuted several   cases and targeted health care fraud. Mr. Acosta’s record and writings will undergo close scrutiny in the weeks before his confirmation hearing. But some of the most outspoken skeptics of the previous labor nominee, the   executive Andrew F. Puzder, have already expressed optimism and   about Mr. Acosta. “I am thrilled that at long last, we have a Hispanic in this cabinet,” said Javier Palomarez, president of the United States Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, who was critical of Mr. Trump during the presidential campaign. Labor groups that assailed Mr. Puzder as being   applauded the choice of Mr. Acosta. “Unlike Andy Puzder, Alexander Acosta’s nomination deserves serious consideration,” said Richard L. Trumka, president of the A. F. L. . I. O. trade union. “In one day, we’ve gone from a   chain C. E. O. who routinely violates labor law to a public servant with experience enforcing it. ” Mr. Puzder withdrew his name from consideration on Wednesday after Republican senators began turning against him. They were concerned about a slew of accusations that had surfaced recently, ranging from Mr. Puzder’s business record to his employment of an undocumented housekeeper to his 1988 divorce. If confirmed, Mr. Acosta could also help smooth the relationship between Mr. Trump and American Muslims who have accused him of fomenting religious discrimination. Testifying before Congress in 2011 at a hearing about the civil rights of American Muslims, Mr. Acosta made a forceful appeal that they should be viewed as any other American community would. “Now is a good time to remember that no community has a monopoly on any particular type of crime,” he said. Despite the early praise Mr. Acosta has received, it is far from certain that his confirmation will be easy. Progressive groups, such as the Democratic “super PAC” American Bridge, were busy on Thursday digging through his background and looking for stains on his record. One area of potential concern is a 2008 investigation by the Justice Department’s inspector general, which looked into whether hiring practices and case assignments at the civil rights division he led were based on political affiliations. A report on the case found that Mr. Acosta had ignored warning signs about such problems. Another pitfall could be a 2004 letter to a federal judge in Ohio that Mr. Acosta sent while he was at the Justice Department, justifying “vote caging” in the presidential election. The practice, in which private citizens in Ohio challenged the eligibility of   voters, was widely seen as a Republican strategy to disenfranchise minorities. Both issues came up when Mr. Acosta was interviewing to become dean of the University of Florida’s law school in 2014. Michelle Jacobs, a professor at the school, said that she and her colleagues were uncomfortable with how Mr. Acosta explained the   case. She also said Mr. Acosta had described paying lip service to lawmakers when called to testify before Congress. “I feel that he lacked some transparency, and he didn’t show a full appreciation for ethical obligations,” Ms. Jacobs said. “We felt it deeply enough that we eliminated him from the list of candidates. ” But colleagues of Mr. Acosta’s at Florida International University said he was widely liked as a leader of the law school, striking a healthy balance of being   without micromanaging. A father of two daughters and a lover of science fiction, Mr. Acosta is known within his department for being humble and genial. “I was actually stunned that Donald Trump would make such a sensible choice,” said José Gabilondo, an F. I. U. law professor who has worked closely with Mr. Acosta. “He’s a very mature person with a sense of decorum, and I think he’ll make a very big contribution to the administration. ”	1

They claimed to have found the man while he was lying unconscious on the banks of the Tangshui River.He finally woke up almost 16 hours after arriving at the hospital, but couldn’t remember his name or how he arrived in Taipei. He was quickly identified by his fingerprints, which instantly attracted global attention from the media and from various Asian governments.The doctors who have been treating him believe that he may be suffering from regressive amnesia, caused by a major stress or life-threatening situation.	0
302	With an executive order last month and a pair of Department of Homeland Security memos on Tuesday, the Trump administration has significantly hardened the country’s policies regarding illegal immigration. Here are some of the most significant elements of the new approach: In 2014, the Obama administration issued guidelines for deporting unauthorized immigrants that placed the highest priority on gang members, felons and those who posed security threats. A goal was to concentrate limited resources on the most serious cases, but many Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents complained that the priorities tied their hands, taking away their discretion as to whom to pursue. Under the new directives, the government “no longer will exempt classes or categories of removable aliens from potential enforcement. ” Immigration agents can now focus on picking up and removing anyone charged with or convicted of any criminal offense, even minor ones, as well as anyone already ordered deported, regardless of whether they have a criminal record. One unauthorized immigrant in California, Kristina, who did not want her last name used because of fear of deportation, said she was alarmed to learn on Tuesday that she would now be considered a prime target. Kristina has been in the country for 25 years and has been ordered deported, but her removal had been postponed for the last four years by the Obama administration. “We have our whole lives here our children are citizens,” she said. “Now I don’t know if I can go out, if I should drive. ” But the Obama guidelines “translated into de facto protections” for people with no legal right to live in the United States, said Dan Stein, president of the Federation for American Immigration Reform, which opposes legalization for unauthorized immigrants. Unless they fell into one of the   categories, Mr. Stein said, “the chance of being deported was virtually zero. ” Under the Obama administration, people caught crossing the border without permission were often released into the United States while their requests for asylum wound through the immigration system, a process that can take years. Most requests are denied, but by then, the immigrant has been living in the United States all that time and may not be easy to find. The Trump administration has declared an end to the   catch and release policy, though it may take awhile to see any significant change. “Catch and release” came about in part because the government had nowhere to hold detainees waiting for immigration decisions. One of the memos released on Tuesday directs officials to expand detention facilities, but it will take time to build centers big enough, or find enough room in jails, to hold the thousands of Mexican and Central American asylum seekers expected to cross the border this year. The document also raises another alternative: sending migrants back to Mexico to wait out the immigration process, even those who are not originally from Mexico. That proposal comes with its own problems. Though United States law appears to allow it, Mexico’s laws do not, if the immigrant is not a Mexican citizen. Two decades ago, Congress passed a law allowing the government to quickly deport undocumented immigrants who have not been in the United States very long, without allowing them go before a judge. In practice, the government has used this process, called “expedited removal,” relatively narrowly because of concerns about whether it violates constitutional rights of due process that are granted to anyone in the United States, regardless of immigration status. Since 2002, expedited removal has been applied only to immigrants who have been in the country less than two weeks and were caught within 100 miles of the border. That is because the Supreme Court has held that such immigrants can still be considered “in transit” and not here long enough to qualify for due process protections. The Trump administration is now planning to use expedited removal as extensively as the original law allows, saying that limits on its use had contributed to a backlog of more than half a million cases in immigration court. Immigration advocates vowed to challenge the change. “Someone could be living in Chicago for a year and a half and then be swept off the street by an ICE agent,” said Lee Gelernt, deputy director of the A. C. L. U.’s Immigrants’ Rights Project, referring to Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents. “He is going to be detained and removed right away without ever seeing a judge. ” One of the memos on Tuesday acknowledges that children who arrive at the border alone  —   “unaccompanied alien children,” in government parlance  —   are entitled to special protections: Unlike other border crossers, whom border patrol agents may deport without a legal hearing, these children must appear before an immigration judge and be interviewed by an asylum officer. Children have surged across the border in recent years, many fleeing violence and destitution in Central America. But the memo turns a sterner face to their parents, who, under the new policy, may be subject to deportation or even prosecution for enabling their children to come into the country. The memo notes that parents and relatives often pay smugglers several thousand dollars to bring their children from Central America, an act that the memo says amounts to facilitating illegal smuggling or trafficking. Immigration advocates are predicting that the policy will drive parents of migrant children further underground. With parents fearful of prosecution, advocates say, navigating the immigration process  —   or even showing up to court  —   could become much harder for these children. Some 750, 000 people who were brought into the country as children were issued work permits and temporary protection from deportation under an Obama program known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA. Even President Trump said last week that the subject “is very, very difficult” for him and that he promised to “deal with DACA with heart. ” So far, the Trump administration has left the program alone. But chills went through the community of “Dreamers,” as DACA recipients are known, with the recent arrest of a    Mexican immigrant in Washington State, Daniel Ramirez. Immigration agents arrested him when they went to his house to detain his father, a convicted drug trafficker. They said Mr. Ramirez admitted to having gang affiliations, which cancels the protection offered under DACA. But Mr. Ramirez denies having made the admission, and his lawyers are fighting his deportation. A program known as 287( g) named for its section of the Immigration and Nationality Act, allows the Department of Homeland Security to train local and state law enforcement officers to work as de facto federal immigration officers, identifying undocumented immigrants in their communities and jails and turning them over to Immigration and Customs Enforcement. From 2006 to 2013, the program led to 175, 000 deportations, according to federal statistics. But investigations and court rulings revealed an ugly side effect: In some jurisdictions, local officers were using their authority to racially profile Latinos. One of the most egregious cases was in Maricopa County, Arizona’s most populous, during the tenure of Sheriff Joseph Arpaio, who a federal judge ruled had discriminated against Latinos in patrols and other enforcement efforts. The Obama administration curtailed the use of the program, which currently involves 32 agencies in 16 states. The Trump administration wants more agencies to take part, and some have already expressed a desire to do so. The administration is trying to significantly expand the amount of information available on the enforcement of immigration laws and, in particular, unauthorized immigrants who commit crimes. Immigration and Customs Enforcement will establish a new office to work with the victims of crimes committed by undocumented immigrants, some of whom appeared with Mr. Trump on the campaign trail. The office, known as Victims of Immigration Crime Engagement, or Voice, will provide victims with information about defendants’ immigration status and whether they are in jail. Significantly, funding for the office comes from reallocating “any and all resources that are currently used to advocate on behalf of illegal aliens” by Immigration and Customs Enforcement. ICE will now have to provide monthly public reports on its apprehensions and releases. The agency also has to publish a weekly report about state and local authorities that release undocumented immigrants from jails. That is a clear shot across the bow at   sanctuary cities that limit their cooperation with federal immigration authorities, contending that turning in unauthorized immigrants would destroy the fragile relationship that the police have with immigrant communities. “We are going to continue our policy that has been in place because we think that it helps us have a safer, stronger, better community,” Mayor Stephanie A. Miner of Syracuse said on Tuesday. The Trump administration is already pondering ways to punish those cities by denying them some federal aid. “Now everyone is going to be able to see how many criminal aliens are being released as a result of the sanctuary policies,” said Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies at the Center for Immigration Studies, which supports tighter controls on immigration. In January 2009, the departing Bush administration extended some Privacy Act rights, which American citizens and legal permanent residents already had, to undocumented immigrants. That meant that information obtained by one agency, like the Internal Revenue Service or Citizenship and Immigration Services, could not generally be shared with other agencies, like Immigration and Customs Enforcement. One rationale for the move was to protect the personal information of immigrants who might one day become citizens covered by the Privacy Act. The Trump administration has now rescinded those privacy protections. One of the memos released on Tuesday said that those protections had been detrimental to the families of the victims of crimes committed by undocumented immigrants, because those families could not get information about such defendants’ legal status, or whether they had been deported, leaving victims “feeling marginalized and without a voice. ” The Department of Homeland Security said it would develop new rules on the sharing of undocumented immigrants’ private information. But advocates for unauthorized immigrants said they feared that immigrants who had applied for legal status  —   in the process divulging they were not here legally  —   were now in danger of having that information used to deport them. “The constitution doesn’t traditionally allow bait and switches,” said Thomas A. Saenz, the president and general counsel of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, an organization that advocates for immigrants. “These are folks who submitted their information attempting to play by the rules, with part of the rules being that the government would protect their privacy. ” The memos released on Tuesday repeat Mr. Trump’s demand in his executive order for a larger enforcement force that can speed up the removal of millions of undocumented immigrants from the United States. In practice, that may play out more slowly than the president might prefer. The source of this caution is none other than John F. Kelly, the homeland security secretary, who told lawmakers this month that he did not believe it would be possible to hire the desired 15, 000 ICE and border patrol agents in the next couple of years. “I’d rather have fewer and make sure that they’re   people,” Mr. Kelly told lawmakers. “I will not skimp on the training and the standards. ” On top of the stringent hiring standards and training, Border Patrol applicants are required to take a polygraph test, which nearly 60 percent fail. A previous surge in hiring under President George W. Bush resulted in dozens of corruption cases, with Border Patrol and other agents accused of taking bribes and providing information to Mexican drug cartels.	1

788	  I’m curious about the Obama mass shooting bill that he signed. Media is no longer allowed to release information about mass shooter. Is this a false report?  President Barack Obama held a press conference today to announce signing into law a bill that prevents U.S. media outlets from naming the shooting suspect in any of their news coverage. This comes just days after a gunman opened fire inside a classroom at a rural Oregon community college, killing nine people and injuring nine others before committing suicide after a shootout with police.“Today I’m proud to announce the ‘Mass Shooting Bill’, which will prevent the media and it’s [sic] coverage from naming the suspect or perpetrator in horrible tragedies like the recent Oregon shooting. If it is some kind of sick fame these individuals desire then that fame is what will be denied,” Obama told reporters. “With the shooting in Oregon, it is important to remember the 9 innocent lives that were lost that day. We must think of heroes like Chris Mintz, who was shot seven times while saving lives and survived, all on his son’s sixth birthday. We must forget the killer.”  	0
297	JACKSON, Miss.  —   When officials in Mississippi’s rural Holmes County, about an hour’s drive north of here, hired an architecture firm to fix the county’s ailing schools, they got back plans for a new $40 million high school to serve 1, 200 students. Holmes County is among the poorest counties in the nation, plagued by   systematic racism, with a population (18, 340) that has been declining for more than a  . Holmes didn’t have $40 million to pay for a high school. Community leaders reached out to Derrick Johnson, state president of the N. A. A. C. P. who also helps underserved Mississippi neighborhoods and districts with strategic planning. “Poor communities here are especially vulnerable,” Mr. Johnson told me the other day. “The whole system perpetuates exploitation. Residents need people they can trust. ” So Mr. Johnson enlisted Roy Decker and Anne Marie Duvall,    architects from Jackson. Since they founded Duvall Decker nearly 20 years ago, the Deckers, as they’re known, have focused mostly on neglected corners in and around Jackson, Mississippi’s capital. To pay the bills, the two have redefined for themselves the ambit of a small architectural practice. They have become developers and even branched into building maintenance: a    strategy that has allowed them more than just financial breathing room. “Assuming more risk and responsibility has also given us a stronger voice, upfront, in this community, with politicians and businesspeople,” Ms. Duvall pointed out. “That’s because we have skin in the game. ” Architects are forever complaining about feeling undervalued, about having lost a seat at the   table. Big ideas  —   the ones that shape whole cities and ultimately determine what is built, for whom and where  —   mostly happen “during the first 10 percent of any project,” as Mr. Decker likes to put it, meaning before architects are called in to design something. For the Deckers, like more and more socially minded architects today, reclaiming that seat is an increasing priority. “When young architects apply to work for us,” Ms. Duvall said, “we ask what they want. Sometimes they say they want to design buildings that are unique, to express themselves. Other times they say they hope their work will have good consequences in a community. We’re finding more young people answering the second way. ” The architect Billie Tsien was a juror for the Architectural League in New York that just gave the Deckers an Emerging Voices award. “There’s a lot of fashionable work out there,” Ms. Tsien said. “Anyone who has done public work for nonprofits can appreciate the effort it takes to make even a smidgen of architecture happen. ” I met some of the people who live and work in the buildings the Deckers have designed. For Midtown, a Jackson neighborhood where the poverty rate hovers around 50 percent, the architects produced a master plan with affordable housing. The   homes  —       modernist duplexes with solar panels and tall   porches  —   have helped resuscitate a main street. Duvall Decker also renovated a nearby strip mall long dominated by a pair of liquor stores. The stores are now gone, replaced by a community health center, the mall painted a stylish slate gray, with shiny   benches and window frames beneath a lofty new portico. The Deckers eked their smidgens out of the arrangement of drainpipes and new signage. With a little money from the city housing authority and a mix of local nonprofits, a mall that used to blight the neighborhood has become an advertisement for it. The architects are looking to do something as transformative for Up in Farms, a food hub that links farmers (average income: $10, 000 a year) with Jackson restaurants, groceries and food banks. The Deckers are upgrading a dilapidated 1940s farmers market in the city. “They have also helped clarify our organization and reduce our costs,” said David Watkins Jr. who runs the hub. “They’re focused on our whole business and our outcomes, not just on designing space. ” Likewise, with Holmes County, the architects consulted parents and teachers on curriculums for kindergarten through 12th grade because the schools’ problems clearly went well beyond a single building. The Deckers brought in a tech consultant to help develop interactive digital learning tools  —   thinking about virtual space “in the same way we are thinking about buildings,” as Mr. Decker put it. Duvall Decker’s plan consolidates several     schools in the shell of an abandoned factory whose reconfiguration will cost residents a fraction of the $40 million the earlier firm originally discussed for just the high school. It’s instructive that Mr. Decker once taught architecture alongside Samuel Mockbee, the beloved, charismatic   of the Rural Studio, who died in 2001. Rural Studio trains Auburn University students to design highly refined buildings for poor communities, mostly in west Alabama. The Deckers acknowledge Rural Studio’s impact. But they don’t think of themselves as part of that legacy. Mr. Decker describes Mockbee’s initial strategy as a kind of   “creative abduction and aestheticized version” of Southern vernacular design. “Rural Studio has always done great   work, but we can’t depend on free labor,” Ms. Duvall added. We were talking on the sunny patio of a restaurant near Duvall Decker’s office, in a growing commercial area of   1950s buildings a couple of miles from downtown. What Mr. Decker said is the only abortion clinic left in Mississippi is just up the block. Next door is a building the Deckers bought years ago. They became almost accidental developers, acquiring a derelict site for a potential studio, receiving an offer to buy it within weeks, and realizing that real estate, on a modest scale, could subsidize their practice. Across the street, in what used to be a dry cleaner, they’re now partners in what expanded will become a hotel. At the same time, the firm fixes leaky pipes and broken windows for clients like an   program called Operation Shoestring. When the lights go out at a veterans’ home mortgage association, another client, Duvall Decker sends over an electrician. When rain falls on the headquarters of a community college honor society, the Deckers themselves sometimes go up on the roof afterward to clear the gutters and sweep away puddles. It’s all of a piece: architecture conceived as buildings with many lives. Tough and pragmatic, Duvall Decker’s work relies on an evolving vocabulary of economical materials and attunement to Southern light. A state library the Deckers designed exploits the changing shadows cast by an irregular grid of precast concrete panels on the facade. Light pours through huge windows into a     reading room for the state book collections. At a civil rights research center and art museum on the campus of Tougaloo, the historically black college on the northern edge of Jackson, I asked Beverly Wade Hogan, the president, what it’s like to work with Duvall Decker. “I talk a lot about what this school means and what it stands for,” she told me. “Roy and Anne listen. ” That’s the goal, Mr. Decker said. “The world is what you make of it,” he added. “For most people here in Mississippi, it’s hard. Our fundamental job as architects is to make it better. ”	1
31	HONG KONG  —   A   commute in Hong Kong turned to panic Friday evening when a man ignited an incendiary device in a crowded subway train, filling the car with flames and smoke and injuring at least 17 people. Photographs taken soon after passengers fled the burning subway car show a man, believed to have started the fire, standing on a platform as flames jumped from the tatters of his burning clothes. Other images show injured commuters, their faces wrapped in gauze, being treated by emergency workers. The police said the man, whom they identified only as a    with the surname Cheung, admitted starting the blaze and was charged with suspicion of arson. Violent crime is exceptionally rare in Hong Kong, home to one of the world’s largest subway systems. Annual ridership ranks just below that of New York, according to the Mass Transit Railway Corporation in Hong Kong. “The suspect was believed to be speaking nonsense,” said Kwok   a police district commander. “What he said didn’t make a lot of sense. ” The South China Morning Post reported that passengers heard the man say that he would “burn you to death” before lighting the device, and local television stations reported that he was carrying a document identifying him as a psychiatric patient. The police would not confirm those details, but fire officials said the blaze was caused by the ignition of a combustible material. “At this stage, we’re certain that there’s no evidence suggesting it was terrorism or an attack targeting the mass transit system,” Mr. Kwok said. Employees and commuters helped put out the flames after the train, traveling on the Tsuen Wan line, arrived at Tsim Sha Tsui station, where it was evacuated. Of the 17 people hospitalized, two were in critical condition, five were in serious condition, nine were in stable condition and one was released, according to the Hospital Authority. Hong Kong’s chief executive, Leung   expressed sympathy for the victims in a statement, and he asked the territory’s food and health secretary, Ko   to visit the hospitalized passengers. The last major arson attack on a subway train in Hong Kong occurred on Jan. 5, 2004, when a fire broke out as a train was arriving at the Admiralty station. Fourteen people were injured. That fire was set by a man using newspapers, a lighter and a bottle believed to contain gasoline.	1
242	ERBIL, Iraq  —   Iraq opened the next chapter in its offensive to drive the Islamic State out of Mosul on Sunday, preparing an assault on the western half of the city. Overnight, planes carpeted the ground with leaflets, directly appealing to the group’s fighters to surrender. “To those of you who were intrigued by the ISIS ideology,” one of the leaflets said, “this is your last opportunity to quit your work with ISIS and to leave those foreigners who are in your homeland. Stay at home, raising the white flags as the forces approach. ” On   television, Prime Minister Haider   announced the beginning of the offensive, describing it as “a new dawn” and calling on his troops “to move bravely forward to liberate what is left of the city. ” The Islamic State has held Mosul for nearly three years, and it is the group’s most important stronghold in Iraq. Retaking the entire city, in what is expected to be a monthslong campaign, would be a huge victory for Iraqi troops. The assault is taking place amid concerns about the condition of hundreds of thousands of civilians trapped in the western part of the city. Food, water and cooking fuel have all been reported to be in short supply, and residents have described increased harassment from Islamic State fighters preparing for the attack. The overall push to free Mosul, once Iraq’s   city, began in October, with local troops pushing from the east into the city’s geographically larger but more sparsely populated eastern half. In late January, they reached the banks of the Tigris River, which bisects Mosul, and declared the city’s eastern section liberated. The operation took longer than expected and took a high toll on civilians and the Iraqi forces, but much of the city’s infrastructure was preserved, and a sense of daily life has returned. That is in contrast to the operations to take back other cities, including Ramadi and Sinjar, which were decimated by airstrikes. More than a year after Sinjar was freed, even its mayor has not been able to return. The fight for Mosul’s western half could be even more protracted than the fight for its east. The west is home to neighborhoods of narrow streets, some so small that it will not be possible for Iraqi troops to enter in their fortified Humvees. That may make the Islamic State’s signature suicide bomb attacks even more effective. Because all five of the bridges spanning the Tigris have been bombed, Iraqi troops will trace a circuitous path to western Mosul, initially approaching it from the south. Officials said the first objective would be Mosul International Airport, just south of the city. By midday on Sunday, Iraqi forces had captured a string of nearby villages and advanced within six miles of the airfield, officers said. American forces are supporting the operation. “The U. S. forces continue in the same role as they did in east Mosul,” Defense Secretary Jim Mattis told reporters traveling with him on Sunday, adding that the rules of engagement for American troops in Iraq had not changed. “We are very close to, if not already engaged in, that fight,” he said. Mr. Mattis added that the   coalition fighting the Islamic State would “continue with the accelerated effort to destroy” the group. Anticipating the offensive, the Islamic State damaged the Mosul airport, carving wide trenches into the runways and adjacent taxiways and aprons, leaving no paved portion usable for aircraft, according to an analysis of satellite imagery by Stratfor, a global intelligence company. While the airport may be unusable, taking it would still be a milestone for the offensive, as would taking the adjacent hilltop village of Abu Saif, which sits at a higher elevation than Mosul. Because of the Islamic State’s heavy use of snipers, securing high ground is crucial, and Iraqi forces were nearing the base of the hill by Sunday afternoon. The troops’ push into western Mosul will be further complicated by the Islamic State’s vast network of tunnels throughout the city, which allow fighters to hide from overhead surveillance. And the group is increasingly using armed drones to spot and remotely bomb advancing Iraqi troops. Yahya Salah, whose neighborhood in eastern Mosul was liberated in November, described how Iraqi troops were just streets away when Islamic State fighters forced their way into his home, armed with a jackhammer. They herded Mr. Salah’s family into one of the bedrooms. From behind the closed door, Mr. Salah said, he heard a deafening sound and realized the fighters were drilling a hole. “They worked without stopping  —   when one got tired, another took over, and they dug a hole that was 1. 5 meters wide,” said Mr. Salah, who said his family had been locked in the bedroom for three days. “When we said we were thirsty, they threw water bottles at us. ” He said the fighters had left at noon on the final day. The Iraqi Army arrived at sunset and unlocked the door. When the family stepped into the rest of their house, they found   piles of dirt in three of their four bedrooms and a hole in the living room floor. The tunnel the fighters had dug stretched for dozens of yards, allowing the terrorist group’s foot soldiers to slip away. Residents have shown reporters similar tunnels throughout the eastern part of the city, and officials expect the same in western Mosul. A photo essay published this weekend by the Islamic State, titled “Life of Fighters South of Mosul,” shows militants cooking a meal on a kerosene stove, reading the Quran and praying inside a tunnel wide enough for five men to stand side by side. At the same time, the Islamic State has become better at the use of small drones, which are available off the shelf in malls across the region, including in Erbil, the nearest major city to Mosul. They use the drones to pinpoint army positions and to target them, and recently recovered Islamic State documents show how the group has cobbled together its own drone program. Iraqi forces say they frequently see the aircraft, two to four feet long, overhead, whining like lawn mowers. Then, 30 minutes later, they take incoming fire at that location. “Mosul would be a tough fight for any army in the world, and the Iraqi forces have risen to the challenge,” Lt. Gen. Stephen Townsend, the commander of the   effort against the Islamic State, said in a news release from United States Central Command announcing the beginning of the operation. Some of the 450 American advisers on the ground in Iraq are helping Iraqi officers plan and carry out the offensive. Reached by telephone, residents in western Mosul described the elation they felt at the approach of government troops. “All we have left to eat is tomato paste. We are eating it with salt,” said Umm Anwar, 41, who asked to be identified only by her nickname. “We are ready to kill ISIS ourselves with knives, or by biting them, because we are in so much pain. ”	1
309	SAN FRANCISCO  —   When new employees join Uber, they are asked to subscribe to 14 core company values, including making bold bets, being “obsessed” with the customer, and “always be hustlin’. ” The   service particularly emphasizes “meritocracy,” the idea that the best and brightest will rise to the top based on their efforts, even if it means stepping on toes to get there. Those values have helped propel Uber to one of Silicon Valley’s biggest success stories. The company is valued at close to $70 billion  by private investors and now operates in more than 70 countries. Yet the focus on pushing for the best result has also fueled what current and former Uber employees describe as a Hobbesian environment at the company, in which workers are sometimes pitted against one another and where a blind eye is turned to infractions from top performers. Interviews with more than 30 current and former Uber employees, as well as reviews of internal emails, chat logs and   meetings, paint a picture of an often unrestrained workplace culture. Among the most egregious accusations from employees, who either witnessed or were subject to incidents and who asked to remain anonymous because of confidentiality agreements and fear of retaliation: One Uber manager groped female  ’ breasts at a company retreat in Las Vegas. A director shouted a homophobic slur at a subordinate during a heated confrontation in a meeting. Another manager threatened to beat an underperforming employee’s head in with a baseball bat. Until this week, this culture was only whispered about in Silicon Valley. Then on Sunday, Susan Fowler, an engineer who left Uber in December, published a blog post about her time at the company. She detailed a history of discrimination and sexual harassment by her managers, which she said was shrugged off by Uber’s human resources department. Ms. Fowler said the culture was stoked  —   and even fostered  —   by those at the top of the company. “It seemed like every manager was fighting their peers and attempting to undermine their direct supervisor so that they could have their direct supervisor’s job,” Ms. Fowler wrote. “No attempts were made by these managers to hide what they were doing: They boasted about it in meetings, told their direct reports about it, and the like. ” Her revelations have spurred   over how unfriendly Silicon Valley workplaces can be to women and provoked an internal crisis at Uber. The company’s chief executive, Travis Kalanick, has opened an internal investigation into the accusations and has brought in the board member Arianna Huffington and the former attorney general Eric H. Holder Jr. to look into harassment issues and the human resources department. To contain the fallout, Mr. Kalanick also began more disclosure. On Monday, he said that 15. 1 percent of Uber’s engineering, product management and scientist roles were filled by women, and that those numbers had not changed substantively over the past year. Mr. Kalanick also held a     meeting on Tuesday, during which he and other executives were besieged with dozens of questions and pleas from employees who were aghast at  —   or strongly identified with  —   Ms. Fowler’s story and demanded change. In what was described by five attendees as an emotional moment, and according to a video of the meeting reviewed by The New York Times, Mr. Kalanick apologized to employees for leading the company and the culture to this point. “What I can promise you is that I will get better every day,” he said. “I can tell you that I am authentically and fully dedicated to getting to the bottom of this. ” Some Uber employees said Mr. Kalanick’s speedy efforts were positive. “I am pleased with how quickly Travis has responded to this,” Aimee Lucido, an Uber software engineer, wrote  in a blog post. “We are better situated to handle this sort of problem than we have ever been in the past. ” As chief executive, Mr. Kalanick has long set the tone for Uber. Under him, Uber has taken a pugnacious approach to business, flouting local laws and criticizing competitors in a race to expand as quickly as possible. Mr. Kalanick, 40, has made pointed displays of ego: In a GQ article in 2014, he referred to Uber as “ ” because of how the company helped him attract women. That tone has been echoed in Uber’s workplace. At least two former Uber workers said they had notified Thuan Pham, the company’s chief technical officer, of workplace harassment at the hands of managers and colleagues in 2016. One also emailed Mr. Kalanick. Uber also faces at least three lawsuits in at least two countries from former employees alleging sexual harassment or verbal abuse at the hands of managers, according to legal documents reviewed by The Times. Other current and former employees said they were considering legal action against the company. Liane Hornsey, Uber’s chief human resources officer, said in a statement, “We are totally committed to healing wounds of the past and building a better workplace culture for everyone. ” Uber’s aggressive culture began with its 2009 founding, when Mr. Kalanick and another founder, Garrett Camp, created a   that would let customers hail a cab with little more than a few taps of their smartphone  —   bypassing many of the headaches people had with the taxi industry. Mr. Kalanick also started putting into place what eventually became Uber’s 14 core values, inspired by the leadership principles at one of the biggest public tech companies, Amazon. To grow quickly, Uber kept its structure decentralized, emphasizing autonomy among regional offices. General managers are encouraged to “be themselves,” another of Uber’s core values, and are empowered to make decisions without intense supervision from the company’s San Francisco headquarters. The top priority: Achieve growth and revenue targets. While Uber is now the dominant   company in the United States, and is rapidly growing in South America, India and other countries, its explosive growth has come at a cost internally. As Uber hired more employees, its internal politics became more convoluted. Getting ahead, employees said, often involved undermining departmental leaders or colleagues. Workers like Ms. Fowler who went to human resources with their problems said they were often left stranded. She and a   others said human resources often made excuses for top performers because of their ability to improve the health of the business. Occasionally, problematic managers who were the subject of numerous complaints were shuffled around different regions firings were less common. One group appeared immune to internal scrutiny, the current and former employees said. Members of the group, called the   and composed of executives who were personally close to Mr. Kalanick, were shielded from much accountability over their actions. One member of the   was Emil Michael, senior vice president for business, who was caught up in a public scandal over comments he made in 2014 about digging into the private lives of journalists who opposed the company. Mr. Kalanick defended Mr. Michael, saying he believed Mr. Michael could learn from his mistakes. Uber’s aggressive workplace culture spilled out at a global   meeting in late 2015 in Las Vegas, where the company hired Beyoncé to perform at the rooftop bar of the Palms Hotel. Between bouts of drinking and gambling, Uber employees used cocaine in the bathrooms at private parties, said three attendees, and a manager groped several female employees. (The manager was terminated within 12 hours.) One employee hijacked a private shuttle bus, filled it with friends and took it for a joy ride, the attendees said. At the Las Vegas outing, Mr. Kalanick also held a companywide lecture reviewing Uber’s 14 core values, the attendees said. During the lecture, Mr. Kalanick pulled onstage employees who he believed exemplified each of the values. One of those was Mr. Michael. Since Ms. Fowler’s blog post, several Uber employees have said they are considering leaving the company. Some are waiting until their equity compensation from Uber, which is restricted stock units, is vested. Others said they had started sending résumés to competitors. Still other employees said they were hopeful that Uber could change. Mr. Kalanick has promised to deliver a diversity report to better detail the number of women and minorities who work at Uber, and the company is holding listening sessions with employees.

577	 Looking a little out-of-this world is something that appealed to Kylie Garth, a body piercer who works in Luna Cobra’s Sydney studio. Before deciding to change the colour of her eyeballs, Garth had experimented with a number of body modifications including face tattoos, piercings, elf-like pointed ears and a bifurcated tongue.“It was mentally intense,” she says of the several injections needed to colour her eyeballs a delicate blue-green, a colour she refers to as sea foam.“It feels like somebody is poking at your eye, then it feels like strange pressure and then it feels you have a bit of sand in your eye, but there’s no pain.” First and foremost, I, Luna Cobra, am the inventor of eyeball, or sclera, tattooing (tattooing the white of the eye in a solid or mix of colours). I first attempted the procedure on sighted human eyeballs in 2007 on three well-informed and consenting parties. Since then, I have fine-tuned both the technique and materials to increase the safety and minimize the risks of tattooing the eyeball. There are still risks involved, of course, but in the 8 years I have been performing this procedure, all my clients are all still ok.Secondly, I personally have not trained anyone else to do this procedure. I have appeared on various tv/news segments though, and have inspired many copycats worldwide. This is important to know because without the proper education, training, experience and guidance, these practitioners have caused vision impairments like blurred vision, spots or floaters, and even blindness. YES PEOPLE ARE NOW BLIND FROM EYEBALL TATTOOING. Permanent colouring of unsightly corneal scars has been known for almost 2000 years.  During the final decade of the 19th and the first decades of the 20th century it was a commonly applied technique. Owing to the tremendous progress in microsurgical reconstructive procedures, corneal tattooing today will only apply for a minor and carefully selected group of patients.  Using the injection method of eyeball tattooing, where a larger area of ink is injected via a single hole, complex designs are not possible, and although fades from one color to another are possible to some extent, they can be difficult to control and master. The difficulty in controlling the spread of the ink makes this method inadvisable for the cornea (ie. over the iris and pupil) because of the danger of obscuring vision if the ink spreads over the pupil. Because only a few injections are required to completely cover the white of an eye with ink, many of the risks in the traditional method such as significant ink loss and ulceration are largely mitigated (although they are not eliminated). However, the injections can be difficult to control, and over-injection or injections that are too deep or too shallow carry significant risk — the appropriate zone is less than a millimetre thick, with serious consequences for missing it.The medical community uses almost exclusively the traditional tattoo method — although even after 150 years they have not come up with an agreed upon technique, which is very telling — whereas the body modification community uses almost exclusively the injection method. To date, attempts to tattoo the white of the eye using traditional needle methods have been extremely unsatistfactory, almost completely falling out. The general consensus is that injection is the only acceptable method of scleral tattooing.	0
373	WASHINGTON  —   In a message posted on Twitter on Saturday, President Trump highlighted a dip in the national debt during his first month in office, contrasting it with an increase in the first month of the Obama administration. The numbers are broadly accurate, but the lack of attention to them is for good reason: Neither president bore responsibility for changes in the federal debt in his opening month in the White House. The slight decline cited by Mr. Trump  —   a drop of 0. 06 percent, according to Treasury data  —   is a temporary fluctuation, not a change in direction. The federal debt is determined by the government’s decisions about taxing and spending, and by the strength of the American economy. The debt was increasing rapidly in early 2009 because the economy was in free fall, and because of policy decisions made during the administration of President George W. Bush. The debt is rising more slowly now because economic growth has strengthened and because of policy decisions made during Mr. Obama’s administration. But the debt is on a clear upward trend. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated in January that the debt would increase by $559 billion in the current fiscal year, ending in September. The exact amount of the debt bounces around that trend line because the Treasury borrows money by selling securities with maturities  —   or repayment dates  —   ranging from 28 days to 30 years. That creates an irregular pattern of inflows and outflows from the federal cash box. The president leveled his complaint on Twitter not long after Herman Cain, a former Republican presidential candidate, raised a similar criticism on “Fox and Friends Weekend. ” Mr. Trump did not describe his calculations, but similar numbers can be derived from the Treasury’s daily reports on the national debt. The data show that on Feb. 21, the national debt was $12 billion smaller than on Jan. 20. As of Thursday, the day with the most recent data, the national debt had declined by $33 billion since Mr. Trump’s inauguration. The daily Treasury reports also show that the national debt increased by $212 billion from Jan. 20 to Feb. 20 in 2009. Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, issued a statement applauding the president for focusing on the national debt while noting that “the improvement this early in his term has to do with normal fluctuations in spending and revenues rather than new policies he has implemented. ” While presidents do not exert immediate influence over the size of the national debt, Mr. Trump will have his chance to make an impact. He has proposed tax cuts that would reduce federal revenues, as well as tariffs on imports that would have the opposite effect. He has also proposed reducing federal spending in some areas while increasing it in others, like defense and infrastructure. The performance of the economy will also play an important role. Economic growth generates more tax revenue and reduces federal spending on social welfare programs. The national debt increased sharply during Mr. Obama’s first term as the government increased spending in response to the 2008 financial crisis. The debt grew more slowly during his second term as the economy improved and tax increases brought more money into the government’s coffers.	1
544	 Gov. Chris Christie on Monday vetoed a bill barring gender-based pay discrimination, saying it would go beyond federal standards and make New Jersey “very business unfriendly.” While emphasizing his support for equal pay protections, the Republican governor criticized where the legislation “departs significantly from well-established law.” In his message for a conditional veto, Christie said there is “no reason for our law to go beyond the Lilly Ledbetter Act,” the federal equal pay legislation.He also added, “However, if we are to make a full recovery, we can’t rely solely on our own hard work. We’ll also need a bit of luck, and you can call it what you want, but in my book, luck equals God’s will. And the Bible is God’s word. So, when someone comes up to me and tells me, ‘Mr. Governor, I think we should allow women to have equal pay as men,’ I’m like, ‘What are you on? I’d like some of that, too,’ because that’s just ludicrous. Biblically speaking, women aren’t and will never be equal to men. And that includes their salaries.” Gov.

147	Over its   existence, the Japanese conglomerate SoftBank and its founder, Masayoshi Son, have been known for ambitious and sometimes   moves. Now, SoftBank is nearing its most unusual move yet: It is buying Fortress Investment Group, an American private equity giant that oversees around $70 billion in assets. That business is a radical departure from the technology and telecommunications holdings for which the Japanese company is known. But the acquisition is intended to energize SoftBank’s other enormous new endeavor: a $100 billion technology investment fund that threatens to roil the private equity world. The move highlights the immense ambitions of SoftBank’s brash founder, Mr. Son. The    mogul, who is one of Japan’s richest men, has sought to shake up the American telecommunications industry and recently sought to win over President Trump by announcing intentions to create jobs in the United States. “Fortress’s excellent track record speaks for itself, and we look forward to benefiting from its leadership,   expertise and   investment platform,” Mr. Son said in a statement late Tuesday. “For SoftBank, this opportunity will immediately help expand our group capabilities, and, alongside our     SoftBank Vision Fund platform, will accelerate our SoftBank 2. 0 transformation strategy of bold, disciplined investment and world class execution to drive sustainable   growth. ” Over the past three decades, SoftBank has become one of Japan’s most formidable technology companies. It is perhaps best known for its telecommunications empire, which stretches from Japan to Sprint in the United States. SoftBank also has portfolio of investments that includes stakes in the Alibaba Group of China, the Japanese affiliate of Yahoo and   like the online lender SoFi. At its helm, the entire time, has been Mr. Son. An   businessman, Mr. Son began the business as a software distributor, but eventually moved into cellphone service and became the first Japanese carrier to embrace the iPhone. He has never been known for his modesty, repeatedly boasting about outsize ambitions like dethroning Verizon and ATT atop the American wireless industry with Sprint. SoftBank will be paying $3. 3 billion for Fortress, a premium to the company’s stock market value of $2. 3 billion. As part of the agreement, SoftBank has the option of bringing in partners to help cover the cost of the deal and who may want to become investors in Fortress funds, too, thus increasing assets under management. The deal frees up Peter L. Briger Jr. and Wesley R. Edens of Fortress to focus on their strengths as fund managers  —   several of their private equity funds have produced   returns over time  —   without having to deal with the headaches of running a public company. As leaders of a public company, they struggled mightily to bolster their stock, more so than their competitors. Recently, the firm shut down its flagship hedge fund. The purchase of Fortress, a prominent private equity firm with a specialty in investing in distressed assets, was driven by Rajeev Misra, a former top derivatives expert at Deutsche Bank who has taken a leading role in setting investment strategy for the SoftBank Vision Fund. After leaving Deutsche Bank in 2008, where he had worked closely with Anshu Jain, who headed the bank’s global markets operations, Mr. Misra went to UBS and then spent several months at Fortress, where he came to know the firm’s chairmen, Mr. Briger and Mr. Edens, well. Now, Mr. Misra will be helping steer an enormous new fund that is intended to invest in technology companies worldwide, often by taking huge stakes. SoftBank is expected to contribute at least $25 billion to the fund, while partners in the fund include Saudi Arabia and Apple. All told, SoftBank will now oversee assets under management of $170 billion, making it one of the largest private investors in the world after the Blackstone Group, which manages about $330 billion. While private equity firms have performed poorly as publicly traded stocks, they are attractive in part because of their ability to lock up money for multiple years and charge high fees. As an entity that is regulated  —   if relatively lightly compared with, say, a bank  —   Fortress will have to operate at arm’s length from the $100 billion Vision Fund when it comes to making investments. And the team of investors under Mr. Misra and Mr. Son will also remain unchanged. Still, it expected that there will be ample opportunity for the Vision Fund to benefit from shared intelligence between the two entities. That could mean Fortress seeing a deal in a telecommunications company that does not fit its mandate and passing it along to the Vision Fund. The transaction also widens the Vision Fund’s capacity to source new investments, given Fortress’s global network. For Fortress, the motivation was to join with one of the world’s most innovative investors and to enter global markets, like the Middle East, where they have trailed some of their peers. Fortress went public on the New York Stock Exchange in 2007, before the financial crisis. But shares of Fortress, like shares of other publicly traded private equity firms, have performed poorly in recent years. Fortress’s stock price is down 80 percent since it began trading, and its executives have made no secret that the joy of being a public company has largely evaporated. The firm’s struggles trace to the financial crisis, when it was slow to exit the subprime loan business, forcing heavy losses. The stock dipped below $1, and the firm did not consistently return to profitability until 2012. At the same time, Mr. Edens positioned the firm to capitalize on the economic recovery, piling back into the subprime business through its purchase of the mortgage servicer Nationstar and consumer lender Springleaf, now known as OneMain Financial. Mr. Edens, a former Lehman Brothers partner who   Fortress, has turned the firm’s $124 million Springleaf investment into a stake valued at roughly $2 billion. Those investments underscore Fortress’s breadth across the American economy. As detailed in a New York Times investigation last year, Fortress is one of several private equity firms that have assumed a pervasive and influential role in daily American life, stepping in for banks that pulled back in the aftermath of the financial crisis. Under the terms of the deal, Fortress will become an independent subsidiary of SoftBank. Fortress’s principals, who control roughly a third of the firm’s voting shares, have agreed to vote in favor of the sale, which is expected to close by year’s end. On Tuesday, before the deal was announced, shares of Fortress rose 6. 5 percent on unusually heavy trading volume.	1
443	SAN FRANCISCO  —   One of Frances Stroh’s earliest lessons about wealth involved a game she played as a    with her father: how to not be kidnapped. Ms. Stroh would stand outside the family’s   Spanish Mediterranean home in the manicured Detroit suburb of Grosse Pointe in 1973 as her father, Eric Stroh, pretended to be a stranger as he drove by in his silver Chrysler, waving a chocolate bar as temptation and beckoning her to the car. As instructed, Frances would run away in tears. Her father explained that as an heiress to the largest private beer company in America, kidnapping was a concern, especially because, “They’ll ask for a ransom that we can’t possibly afford to pay,” Ms. Stroh recalled him saying. “There were very mixed messages” about money, she said in an interview. Her father’s words about their finances were indeed prescient. The Stroh family wealth, at its height in the 1980s, was estimated by Forbes to be about $9 billion in today’s dollars. Now, that money is almost completely gone. And Ms. Stroh has taken the rare step, in the secretive world of America’s wealthiest, of going public with her family’s downward spiral in a remarkably intimate book, “Beer Money: A Memoir of Privilege  and Loss. ” In revealing detail, she documents a trifecta of misfortunes, some of them  : the unraveling of her immediate family, shaken by alcohol and drug abuse the collapse of her family’s brewing empire and the fall of Detroit, hometown of Stroh’s beer. The book has struck a nerve in certain circles, and Ms. Stroh says she has received an outpouring of support and commiseration. “I heard from all kinds of people about lost fortunes, lost businesses, often coupled with   issues within the families,” she said. “My story resonated with their own experience because of this lingering sort of sense of something that’s unresolved when a family business is lost. ” Headlines tend to focus on billionaires who fall from grace after committing crimes, like the Ponzi schemer Bernard L. Madoff, or the former WorldCom chief executive Bernard J. Ebbers. But the more   and reliable way to lose a fortune, however, often comes down to just one word: family. An abundance of heirs mixed with patriarchal lines of succession that fail to produce talented leaders can be disastrous. The Strohs’ saga is a textbook example. Bernhard Stroh immigrated to Detroit from Germany in 1850, selling his popular beer   . A brewery followed and grew regionally, especially thriving after World War II. By the 1980s, it was America’s   beer company. Then the fourth generation of family managers decided the best way to expand was through expensive acquisitions and going national, buying the Schlitz, Schaefer and Old Milwaukee brands, among others. But debt from those deals kept the company from making competitive moves. Stroh’s missed the timely pivot to light beers, and sales plummeted. Other bad investments followed, including ventures in which the family had less expertise, like biotech and Detroit real estate as the city faced severe decline. Hundreds of millions more were lost. All through the company’s boom and bust, the number of heirs grew, many relying on annual dividends of up to hundreds of thousands of dollars to fund sometimes lavish lifestyles. Ms. Stroh’s father spent millions on antiques and collectibles, like rare cameras and guitars. (Later the family would discover many of these were fakes or worth far less than what he paid.) As the brewery’s profits dried up, the dividends to the heirs continued, but the money was siphoned from principal, further hastening the company’s decline. By 1999 the company was sold off in pieces, and the proceeds of those sales were soon depleted or poorly invested by the company’s board, until little remained. Though some families have managed to keep thriving  —   descendants of the newspaper magnate William Randolph Hearst still own media properties worth billions and the Mars candy company, founded in 1911, remains   with estimated annual revenues of more than $35 billion  —   the same type of scenario that befell the Strohs has consumed other family fortunes. “Dynasties are suddenly hard to pull off,” said Michael McGerr, professor in the history department at Indiana University in Bloomington, who is writing a book on the Vanderbilt family, which also lost much of its wealth. “It’s because you have to be really lucky within your own family. ” Heirs are not automatically qualified, competent or visionary leaders, Dr. McGerr said, and when power is passed solely from fathers to sons, those who might better manage an empire  —   like women family members or outsiders  —   are excluded. While Ms. Stroh was being taught how to avoid being kidnapped, the men in her generation were being groomed to lead the company. “It would have been discouraged if a girl in the family had shown some ambition for a role like that,” she said. Today, Ms. Stroh is a successful businesswoman. Now 50, she lives in San Francisco, and took a relatively modest inheritance of about $200, 000 in stocks from her mother and made savvy investments in tech companies and real estate. As a   developer and landlord, she is able to live independently in one of the nation’s most expensive cities. She is doing well enough that she is investing back in Detroit, but in a way that will pay a different type of dividend. She donated half of the advance and 10 percent of the book sale proceeds from “Beer Money” to 826michigan, a nonprofit organization that tutors   children in writing. “One of my goals with the book was to use it as a way to   with Detroit in a meaningful way,” Ms. Stroh said.	1
889	 Obama Signs Executive Order Banning Confederate Flags, MemorabiliaDuring a White House-hosted dinner celebrating the Islamic holy month of Ramadan Monday evening, President Obama, flanked by select cabinet members, announced he has signed into law an executive order banning the manufacturing, distribution, and possession of Confederate flags and other memorabilia.Also included in the executive order is an amendment to 18 U.S. Code 249, allowing for any “individual or entity found to be in violation of the law” to be prosecuted under the federal hate crimes statute. Under federal law, the punishment carries a mandatory minimum sentence of ten years. “In light of recent events, I’m inclined to believe a ten-year sentence is far too lenient,” Al Sharpton told CNN’s Wolf Blitzer today. Blitzer, who agreed with Sharpton, said many in Washington have echoed similar sentiment.Under orders from the White House, the Department of Justice, while working in conjunction with local and state law enforcement agencies, will, in the coming weeks, launch a nationwide operation to halt manufacturing and distribution of the soon-to-be-illegal contraband.	0

295	The restaurant’s ratings are as good as it gets: three stars from Michelin and four from The New York Times. But for all the success of Eleven Madison Park, its owners, Will Guidara and the chef Daniel Humm, are about to start a major overhaul. They plan to close the Manhattan restaurant on June 9 to renovate the kitchen and the dining room, and to ship the operation and staff to a more casual, temporary setting in the Hamptons. If all goes well, they expect to reopen in   with a new look and a revised menu with some new dishes. “It’s time for a change,” Mr. Humm said. “We’ve been at the restaurant for 11 years, and it’s been open for 20 years. We’re still using Danny Meyer’s brasserie. ” Mr. Humm was referring to the restaurant’s original owner, who sold it to them in 2011. Back then, they considered closing and renovating but held back because they thought it was more important to establish their footing. So they made only small changes over time to their stately dining room, with its Art Deco geometry and soaring casement windows overlooking Madison Square Park. The kitchen is also nearly 20 years old its renovation will require closing the restaurant. Mr. Humm has already ordered a Molteni stove from France, a   of cookery with a comparable price tag. But he does not plan to outfit his kitchen with lots of   electronic gear. “We cook in a pretty traditional way,” he said. The partners are entrusting the redesign, which has not been completed, to Brad Cloepfil, who has offices in New York and Portland, Ore. and whose only restaurant work has been in Portland. He designed the Museum of Arts and Design, at Columbus Circle, and the Contemporary Art Museum in St. Louis. Mr. Cloepfil knows Eleven Madison Park well and has been a regular customer. “I’m thrilled to be doing this,” he said. “It’s a great, elemental, historic room that needs preserving and updating. ” The partners want to open up the entrance, which is now partitioned from the dining room, and rearrange seating to give the whole room a more symmetrical, central focus. There will be rugs on the terrazzo floors and more color everywhere: grays, blues, greens and golds. “I’m not making a design statement,” Mr. Cloepfil said. “If people are startled, I will have failed. ” The most significant change will be in the bar area, which will be enlarged somewhat and given a more distinct identity. The partners decided that during the renovation this summer, they would need to find a way to keep the staff working. “We thought about what New Yorkers did in summer  —   they go to the Hamptons,” Mr. Guidara said. Once the restaurant closes, they will move into a big white farmhouse on Pantigo Road in East Hampton. For decades, it was the Spring Close restaurant in the past few years it has been Moby’s, for fish. They’re calling their   EMP Summer House it will open in late June with an indoor restaurant, a dining room under a tent with picnic tables for   dinners like lobster boils, and another outdoor area. The equipment they will no longer need in Manhattan will outfit the kitchen. Reservations for indoor seating will be taken online starting on May 1. Only cards from American Express, Mr. Humm and Mr. Guidara’s partner in this project, will be accepted. In   before Eleven Madison Park closes, the partners will replace its current menu with an   $295 tasting menu recalling favorites over the years. Dishes will include sea urchin cappuccino, carrot tartare, foie gras with maple syrup, poached chicken with black truffles, and the   dessert called Milk and Honey. When the restaurant reopens, Mr. Humm plans to offer multicourse tasting menus that are similar to the present   format, perhaps with more choices. (The particular dishes have not been determined.) In recent years, the number of courses has gradually been reduced, and the number of choices increased. “We’ll be starting over in many ways,” Mr. Guidara said. “And we’ll finally be making the restaurant truly our own. ”	1
365	I cannot possibly count how many times I have been sought out by some mom with an urgent, hard, particular shine in her eye who wants to know, needs to know, how and what I feed my children. As I am in fact a woman, a restaurant chef and a parent of two, it’s an understandable mistake. Let me disappoint straight away: My priority has never been having kids who eat it is about having kids who sleep. Nobody wants to get home from a restaurant job at 1:30 in the morning, stir themselves a medicinal, soporific negroni, shower off the greasy stink of a commercial kitchen and finally hit the pillow around 3 a. m. only to hear the cracking thunder of her alert and chipper darlings at 6:30 a. m. I decided I could tolerate all the Cheddar Goldfish and the years of plain buttered pasta as long as they slept till 11 a. m. I was also a little jumpy about making the dinner table some weird proxy outlet for ego trips or power trips. Once, on a summer vacation to Corsica, my mother forced one of my brothers to stay at the dinner table until he finished his plate of oily, slick ratatouille  —   a texture that made him gag  —   and in the end, he not only never ate it, but the struggle went on for a full 48 hours, escalating to such heights that the boy went missing the next day, was not found by dark, was not found by midnight and was only returned by the local gendarmes the following evening. I was anxious for him, and also for her. She was not equipped to make five different dinners for five different kids at their varying stages of a developing palate, nor to tolerate it. And I knew a guy who would bring his    daughter to my restaurant all the time  —   dressed exclusively in black      and black leggings  —   and incessantly advertise his suffocating pride at the fact that she “loved” the monkfish liver at Prune and the sea urchin at, as I recall, Le Bernardin. I know I was supposed to be impressed, but it made me squirm. I prefer the family dinner table to be pretty pleasant for everyone at it, including the   and lonely parents who most often find themselves home solo  —   either by dint of divorce, single parenting or   (one parent stays late at work while the other is tasked with getting home in time to feed the little people)  —   and who find themselves with only 20 or so urgent minutes to get the job done, not to mention a stubborn kid who won’t eat, well, ratatouille, for example. If you find yourself in the bland, boring, beige phase, when different textures cannot butt up against another on the same plate, or one speck of parsley can contaminate the whole dinner, I encourage you to find all the white foods you can actually love  —   cauliflower, chicken, fish, rice, apples, bread, eggs, banana  —   and go at them with deft ambidexterity: a plain piece of swordfish for those who will run away from home otherwise, and a lively piquant pan sauce  —   in this case lemony, capery piccata  —   for those who will drink themselves to an early death if they don’t have something adult and interesting at the table to eat. In other words, sauce, but at all times, on the side. Unless we are discussing real food scarcity or a diagnosed medical condition, I wish I had encouraged all those moms who have cornered me over the years to fix themselves a small bowl of something acidic and buttery and lively and herbaceous and drop it on the dinner table and take it a little easier over the   and   phases of their otherwise perfectly healthy kids. My kids did not die from too many meals of plain buttered pasta, or plain buttered chicken, or plain buttered swordfish, or plain buttered cauliflower. And they were not harmed by mercury or pesticides or hidden   corn syrup because I always shopped right. They were not kids to brag about, necessarily, from a culinary perspective, nor were they easy to take to more ambitious friends’ houses or better restaurants for the longest time. I had to disappoint a lot of   mothers along the way who thought I had the magic answer. But we’ve lately rounded the corner, as one likes sushi and they both like ramen and broccoli and one asks for hot sauce and creamed spinach while the other has started craving the tart brightness of lemon juice  —   affording me an experience I thought I had forsaken long ago, that of hearing the   sound in the whole world: “Mama, I think this is the best swordfish you have ever made. ” Which is outranked only by the No. 1 greatest sound of all time: the           stretch of silence of my champion sleepers.

381	The Carpetbagger has spent months reporting on the awards season. Here, she predicts the Oscar winners. Make your own Oscar picks with this interactive ballot. From its   premiere at the Venice Film Festival last summer, “La La Land,” the tale of   strivers reaching for   glory, has charmed best picture wins out of prize givers. It has it all  —   singing, dancing, Ryan Gosling, summer frocks that never wrinkle  —   along with a muted choir of dissenters who don’t understand all the fuss. One crucial win “La La” missed was the top Screen Actors Guild Award, an Oscar bellwether that went instead to “Hidden Figures,” adding a measure of frisson to a race that’s all but sewn up. That boost for “Hidden Figures” is certainly giving “La La Land” a bit of competition, as is the indie favorite, “Moonlight,” a surprise hit with an ardent fan base. The failure of “La La Land” to land even a SAG nomination is injurious but hardly fatal. (The musical is a   not an ensemble.) By now, it is hard to imagine anything stopping the momentum of “La La Land. ” It is heading into the Academy Awards with 14 nominations, tying the previous record holders, “Titanic” and “All About Eve. ” Another point to remember is that when it comes to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, “best picture” really means “most popular picture. ” And “La La Land” is about something that academy voters cherish above all: themselves. You know it’s a tight race when Amy Adams and Annette Bening are shut out despite critically lauded performances in equally lauded films. But Emma Stone is the heavy favorite for her turn in “La La Land,” having snagged the Golden Globe, the Bafta and the Screen Actors Guild Award. Whether Ms. Stone really bested her fellow Oscar contenders Meryl Streep, Ruth Negga, Natalie Portman and Isabelle Huppert is a matter of opinion, but other factors work in her favor: She largely carried an enormously popular film, she’s an ingénue in Hollywood’s eyes, she’s well liked by the academy, and she has been nominated for an Oscar before. While Ms. Huppert is putting up stiff competition, it’s almost assuredly Ms. Stone’s year. Casey Affleck has been in the Oscar race before but didn’t win. His   turn in “Manchester by the Sea,” along with his many triumphs all season long, pointed to Oscar gold. Then the Screen Actors Guild Award for best actor went to Denzel Washington (“Fences”) an upset that shocked everyone, even Mr. Washington. Given that the actors’ branch is the academy’s largest, and that most SAG winners go on to nab Oscars, Mr. Washington seems well poised to win. (And for Mr. Affleck, renewed attention to 2010 sexual harassment complaints that he settled didn’t help.) But Mr. Washington already has two Oscars, and only six actors in history have won more. So I’m betting on Mr. Affleck. This category was locked up from the word go. Viola Davis could have easily run for best actress for her performance in “Fences”  —   and arguably should have, given that she won the Tony for a lead role for the same part when “Fences” ran on Broadway. But Ms. Davis is said to have chosen to run for supporting actress, a less competitive category. Regardless, few doubt it is high time that she won an Oscar. This is her third nomination, and she has already landed more than two dozen awards this season. While her fellow competitors have all gamely shown up to support their films, Ms. Davis owns the category. While there are indications of a possible upset  —   Dev Patel won the Bafta for “Lion”  —   odds favor Mahershala Ali from “Moonlight. ” Though Mr. Ali spent far less time onscreen than some of his fellow nominees  —   like Jeff Bridges, who dominated much of “Hell or High Water”  —   his performance as the tenderhearted drug dealer Juan was one of the season’s most talked about. He also brought peerless grace and elegance to his   appearances, which are crucial to any campaign. It is hard to imagine anyone topping Mr. Ali’s heartfelt “I am a Muslim” acceptance speech from the SAG Awards, except, come Sunday, Mr. Ali himself. “The Umbrellas of Cherbourg” was released 21 years before Damien Chazelle was born, yet the homage he pays to it and other musicals of yore in his hit, “La La Land,” greatly endeared him to the academy. Although early chatter suggested his fellow nominees Kenneth Lonergan and Barry Jenkins were strong bets, Mr. Chazelle has mopped up big prizes: a Golden Globe, a Bafta and, crucially, the Directors Guild of America Award. The guild’s membership overlaps with the academy’s, and the D. G. A. Awards are largely predictive of Oscars. It also helps that Mr. Chazelle is a known quantity to the academy: His “Whiplash” took home three Oscars in 2015. Until a few weeks ago, Disney’s “Zootopia,” about a plucky rabbit police officer fighting prejudice and a   lamb, seemed a   for this prize, having collected a Golden Globe and a Producers Guild Award. But then “Kubo and the Two Strings,” about a Japanese boy on a hero’s quest to defeat an evil spirit, won the Bafta for animated feature, an accolade that usually foretells an academy win. “Kubo” is also up for best visual effects, making it a very strong contender. But “Zootopia” will probably benefit from its timing: It is a love letter to diversity and the triumph of acceptance over xenophobia, a message the film’s campaigners have been pushing all season long. And the Academy Award for best documentary feature goes to   …     a nearly   television  . Though the director Ezra Edelman and his backers at ESPN vigorously insist their virtuoso project “O. J.: Made in America” is genuinely a theatrical film rather than one made for TV, the fact is, it is both. And that has done nothing to stop Mr. Edelman from winning almost every major documentary award this season, among them a Producers Guild prize. While some believe the television lineage of “O. J. ” will undercut its chances with the academy  —   and note that the Bafta for best documentary went to Ava DuVernay’s “13th” (“O. J. ” wasn’t eligible)  —   odds are that Mr. Edelman will be collecting an Oscar. Early in the season, the momentum seemed to be behind “Toni Erdmann,” a German satire with a run time of nearly three hours that thrilled critics. But that is long to sit through for a foreign film, especially for voters watching screeners. After France’s entry, “Elle,” failed to be nominated, energy seemed to shift to Sweden’s “A Man Called Ove. ” But then came the White House travel ban, which drew attention to Iran’s much lauded entry, “The Salesman,” by Asghar Farhadi, who announced that he would boycott the ceremony in protest. Mr. Farhadi won an Oscar for his 2011 drama “A Separation. ” This time, voting for him has become political, which will probably give him the edge. “Manchester by the Sea,” a poignant and at times wry tale of a Massachusetts man gripped by grief, made history this year by becoming the first film to land a best picture Oscar nomination for a streaming service (its distributor is Amazon). Yet the film’s best picture chances are slim, thanks to the juggernaut that is “La La Land. ” But Kenneth Lonergan, the “Manchester” director, is expected to win the Oscar for best original screenplay. Few match his skills at capturing and conveying onscreen the idiosyncrasies, awkwardness and absurdities of everyday conversation and life. Also bolstering Mr. Lonergan’s chances: His script isn’t up against “Moonlight,” which was deemed an adaptation and has passionate support. Whether Barry Jenkins’s screenplay for “Moonlight,” a cinematic tone poem about growing up poor, black and gay, should be considered adapted or original is in the eye of the beholder. The Writers Guild of America and Bafta organizers deemed it original, but the academy decided it was an adaptation of an unproduced stage piece by Tarell Alvin McCraney, who receives story credit. The academy’s designation certainly helped the film’s chances in the adapted category by not pitting it against “Manchester by the Sea,” which took home the original screenplay Bafta. Still, “Moonlight” ended up besting “Manchester” for original screenplay at the Writers Guild Awards. Confusing? Sure. But in the end, it makes the movie the favorite here.	1

29	GIFU, Japan  —   Liu Hongmei was fed up with her job at a Shanghai clothing factory, where she worked long hours for little pay. So three years ago, she quit to take a job in Japan. A garment factory there promised Ms. Liu three times her $   Chinese wage, and she hoped to save thousands of dollars for her family, which was growing with the recent birth of a son. “It seemed like a big opportunity,” she recalled. Call it an opportunity, maybe, but don’t call it work. Legally, the time Ms. Liu spent ironing and packing women’s wear in Japan is considered “training. ” She had entered the murky and at times abusive world of Japan’s technical trainees  —   essentially   laborers brought in from abroad to fill jobs that Japanese citizens aren’t taking. Just like the United States and other developed countries, Japan has a hard time finding people to pick vegetables, collect   bedpans and wash restaurant dishes. In America, many of these     jobs are filled by illegal immigrants, an arrangement attacked by President Trump during his campaign. Japan, on the other hand, long ago achieved what Mr. Trump has promised: It has very little illegal immigration and is officially closed to people seeking   work. Now, though, its tough stance on immigration  —   legal and illegal  —   is causing problems. Many Japanese industries are suffering from severe labor shortages, which has helped put a brake on economic growth. That is prompting Japan to question some fundamental assumptions about its labor needs. The debate is politically delicate, but changing realities on the ground  —   in Japan’s factories and fields  —   are forcing politicians to catch up. Japan’s total   labor force topped one million for the first time last year, according to the government, lifted in part by people entering the country on visas reserved for technical trainees. That growth has also led to an increase in cases of worker abuse and fraud, labor activists say. Ms. Liu is part of that debate. She arrived in Japan in debt after paying brokers $7, 000 to arrange her visa. Once there, she said, she found onerous working conditions and    pay. Her bosses, she said, “treat us like slaves. ” Ms. Liu and other Chinese workers at her factory came to Japan through a   internship program. Its purpose is to square the circle between Japan’s labor shortage and its ban on   immigration. Farms,   businesses and many manufacturers would struggle to stay afloat without foreign trainees, specialists say. “Practically every vegetable in the supermarkets of Tokyo was picked by a trainee,” said Kiyoto Tanno, a professor at Tokyo Metropolitan University. To appease business groups, the government has created immigration loopholes, and hundreds of thousands of   workers like Ms. Liu have poured through them. They come from China and Vietnam, the Philippines and Cambodia, and they are filling empty jobs in Japan as the Japanese population shrinks, becoming a crucial if underacknowledged motor of the economy. Their numbers are soaring. The trainee program has doubled in size in the last five years, to over 200, 000, according to official data, and the government is planning to expand it. The biggest source of workers has been China, but much of the recent growth has come from Vietnam. Few doubt that “training” is a fig leaf. Beyond a short period of language study, most trainees receive little or no instruction that would distinguish them from regular manual laborers, specialists and participants say. “The system is like calling a crow white,” said Yoshio Kimura, a member of Parliament from the governing Liberal Democratic Party who heads the party’s labor committee. “What we’re really doing is importing labor. ” Training is not the only way around Japanese immigration restrictions. There are also students in   jobs, asylum seekers waiting for refugee applications to be processed  —   almost all are ultimately rejected  —   and South Americans of Japanese descent who can obtain special visas based on their ancestry. Demand still outstrips supply. The number of   Japanese has been falling since the   a consequence of decades of low birthrates. Nationwide unemployment is just 3 percent, and in some places, jobs are simply going begging. There are three to four positions open in nursing care and construction for every person who applies, according to government surveys. Eventually, Japan plans to lengthen the maximum time that trainees can stay in the country to five years, from three, and allow more kinds of businesses to hire them, including nursing homes and cleaning companies for offices and hotels. Parliament approved the creation of a new agency to oversee the trainee program last year, in response to criticism over worker exploitation. Once it is in place, the plan is to bring in more workers. Mr. Kimura and some other lawmakers want to go further, by establishing a formal guest worker system. Though it would not open a path to immigration  —   workers would still be expected to go home eventually  —   it would be more forthright than the current approach. Business groups favor the proposal, and the Liberal Democrats approved it as party policy in May. The government of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has not indicated whether it will follow through. “If we want economic growth in the future, we need foreigners,” Mr. Kimura said. Nobuya Takai, a lawyer who has represented foreign trainees in labor disputes, said the pretense that trainees are not workers contributes to problems. Companies do not hire them directly, but through a byzantine system of government and   middlemen. Most trainees end up thousands of dollars in debt to pay broker fees before they even arrive, say Mr. Takai and others who have studied the program. And because trainees cannot easily switch jobs  —   their visas tie them to a single company  —   they lack what should be major leverage: the ability to walk out on a bad employer. “They can’t change jobs, and they lose money if they go home,” Mr. Takai said. In 2011, an American State Department report on human trafficking flagged the trainee program for what it said were inadequate protections against “debt bondage” and other abuses. When trainees don’t save enough to repay broker fees, they sometimes stay on illegally. Almost 6, 000 did so in 2015, according to Japan’s Justice Ministry. (There are about 60, 000 foreigners total in Japan without valid visas, according to the government, compared with an estimated 11 million unauthorized immigrants in the United States.) The New York Times spoke with more than a dozen trainees. All of them said they had paid labor brokers in their home countries, usually $7, 000 to $11, 000, to come to Japan to work. Most borrowed the money from family or banks. The trainees came from several countries in Asia and worked in different industries, in different parts of Japan: a Cambodian construction worker, a Chinese lettuce picker, seamstresses from China and Vietnam. Complaints about unpaid labor were common. Cao Bao, a    from Jilin Province in northeast China, worked for Kishimoto Manufacturing, a small auto parts supplier in central Japan. He said Chinese trainees there were made to clean and paint the factory on their days off, without pay, when managers found errors in their work. He was fired when he complained, he said, and a Japanese labor union has taken up his case. “Some Japanese are helpful and nice, but the people at the company are different,” Mr. Cao said. Masahisa Kishimoto, the company’s president, said Mr. Cao had left of his own accord, and he blamed cultural differences for problems at the factory. In China, he said, “they don’t clean. ” “There are no rules,” he continued. “There’s a sense that you if you don’t get caught, you can do anything. ” Mr. Kishimoto referred other questions to Joho Highway   an employers’ association that recruits trainees on behalf of Kishimoto Manufacturing and other local businesses. The   said that Kishimoto had been imposing “penalty” overtime on both Japanese and Chinese workers, in violation of labor rules, and that Kishimoto had compensated the employees after the   intervened. Mr. Kishimoto said the company had fully complied with labor laws. Government data on workplace accidents shows that trainees are more likely to be hurt on the job than Japanese workers  —   a result of poor training, language barriers or more dangerous assignments. Since 2010, two trainee deaths have been recognized by the government as cases of karoshi, the Japanese term for death by overwork. Given widespread underreporting of overtime, the true number could be higher. In the financially struggling garment industry, abuses are pervasive enough that the minister of economy, trade and industry promised an inquiry last year, during a debate in Parliament over expanding the trainee program. Tham Thi Nhung, 32, a mother of two from Vietnam, said she worked from 8 a. m. to 9 or 10 p. m. Her job was to sew jackets, coats and dresses at a small clothing factory in Aichi prefecture, an industrial region in central Japan. All but one of the business’s six seamstresses were Vietnamese, Ms. Nhung said. They hadn’t had a day off in four months, she said, but the owner was recording only part of their overtime. In November, after the women complained that they were being underpaid by $712 a month, the owner sent a letter saying the factory was closing, and they were being laid off. A telephone number registered for Ms. Nhung’s employer, Fashion Ai, was not working, and a lawyer representing the company declined to comment. “We told the boss, but she said she wouldn’t pay more,” Ms. Nhung said. “She told us to keep working or go back to Vietnam. ” Ms. Liu said she emptied her savings and borrowed from relatives to cover the visa fee. Ms. Liu and her colleagues said their employer had been paying them less than the legal minimum wage for overtime, and had been overcharging them for company housing. The employer was    Takeshi Nakahara, who along with his wife owns several small garment factories in Gifu, near Aichi. He started using Chinese trainees 15 years ago, he said in an interview, because “no Japanese want to work in the apparel industry. ” Low wages are the only way to compete with cheap foreign factories, he added. “Most manufacturers have moved overseas,” he said. “It’s the only way to stay profitable. ” Mr. Nakahara said he had been paying Ms. Liu and other Chinese workers less than minimum wage for overtime, though he said the idea had been theirs. “They demanded more overtime work,” he said. “I told them it wouldn’t be profitable for the company, and they said they were willing to work for less. ” Although the arrangement was illegal, he said he felt betrayed when the women, nearing the end of their   contracts, made demands for back pay. The workers sought help from Zhen Kai, a Chinese labor activist who has lived in Japan for decades. He operates a small union office in Gifu that includes temporary rooms in which workers can stay. Mr. Zhen says that he sympathizes with the businesses and that many would have folded without the trainee program. The government, he says, has effectively kept such businesses alive by letting them exploit workers. “Owners often say to me, ‘Are you trying to destroy my company? ’” he said. Mr. Zhen negotiated with the Nakaharas, who offered a settlement, initially about $5, 800. Fed up and homesick, Ms. Liu accepted the offer and was getting ready to go back to China, even though she still owed money to the relatives who helped her pay for her visa. The other four women decided to stay in Japan to fight for more compensation, and a few weeks later accepted offers of $10, 000 to $16, 000. Asked if they had learned anything during their ostensible training, they laughed bitterly. “Only hardship,” Ms. Liu said. “My image of Japan,” she said, “was that it was a good country. ”	1

418	As the Oscar for best picture was being presented at the 89th Academy Awards on Sunday night, Tim Ryan, the United States chairman of PwC, was sitting in a plush seat in the Dolby Theater, watching with satisfaction. PwC, an accounting firm based in London, has tabulated the votes for the Academy Awards for 83 years. And the Oscars, while not its most lucrative client, is perhaps its most important. The firm leans on its long history as Hollywood’s chief   to enhance its appeal in efforts like business development and recruiting. So when “La La Land” was named the   winner and the producers began delivering their acceptance speeches, it appeared Mr. Ryan’s work for the night was done. Then chaos erupted on the stage. A PwC partner had handed Warren Beatty, a presenter of the award, the wrong envelope. Faye Dunaway, presenting the award with Mr. Beatty, erroneously announced that “La La Land” had won. Moments later, after the two PwC partners who oversee the voting came onstage, the “La La Land” producers announced that “Moonlight” was in fact the winner. Mr. Ryan watched in horror as the bizarre scene played out before Hollywood’s biggest stars and tens of millions of people watching around the globe. In a dizzying turn of events, his firm, which normally occupies a back seat at the glamorous event, was suddenly at the center of one of the most sensational stories in Oscars history. “I knew something was up,” he said in a telephone interview on Monday, zeroing in on the discordant moment when he noticed two of his employees interrupting the best picture acceptance speeches. “It’s not their job to come out on stage. ” As the magnitude of the gaffe set in, Mr. Ryan went into   mode. “What was going though my head at the time was, ‘We have to get to the bottom of this, and if we made a mistake, we’ll own up to it,’” Mr. Ryan said. “My philosophy in life is, bad news doesn’t age well. ” Reaction to the mistake has been swift and harsh. “The accountants have one job to do  —   that’s to give Warren Beatty the right envelope,” Leslie Moonves, the chief executive of CBS, said in a videotaped interview after the show, which was broadcast on ABC. “That’s what these people are paid a lot of money to do. If they were my accountant, I would fire them. ” On Monday, the hashtags #envelopegate and #Oscarfail were trending on Twitter, and PwC, a business that markets its services to other businesses, was newly on the tip of many consumers’ tongues in an unforgiving fashion. “You had one job!” several people remarked, tagging the company’s username and the two partners who oversaw the ballots, who were the public faces of PwC’s efforts before and during the show. Some criticized PwC, formerly known as PricewaterhouseCoopers, on an unofficial Facebook page for the business, with one person remarking its acronym could stand for “probably wrong card. ” Just as quickly as the fortunes of “La La Land” and “Moonlight” changed, PwC, one of the   Big Four accounting firms, had a major brand crisis on its hands. “Not since Janet Jackson and her wardrobe malfunction on the Super Bowl have we seen something quite as glaring as this snafu,” said Andrew D. Gilman, the chief executive of the crisis communications firm CommCore Consulting Group, referring to the 2004 episode. Although most of PwC’s clients are aware that mistakes can happen, “the name of the firm has unfortunately been a little sullied,” he added. PwC was quick to accept responsibility for the mistake. According to Mr. Ryan and others briefed on the process, a PwC partner, Brian Cullinan, handed Mr. Beatty the wrong envelope. Instead of the envelope containing the winner for best picture, Mr. Cullinan accidentally handed Mr. Beatty a duplicate of the envelope for best actress  —   an award Emma Stone had accepted for her role in “La La Land” just moments before. For the Oscars, PwC uses two complete sets of the envelopes, with one placed on each side of the stage. Mr. Cullinan was handling one side, and the other partner overseeing the voting process, Martha L. Ruiz, was handling the other. It isn’t clear what led Mr. Cullinan to hand Mr. Beatty the wrong envelope. Mr. Cullinan posted on Twitter a photograph of Ms. Stone backstage shortly after she won the award for best actress, and minutes before the   according to The Wall Street Journal. The post, which has been deleted, said “Best Actress Emma Stone backstage! #PWC. ” The design of the envelopes could have been a factor. The envelopes were redesigned this year to feature red paper with gold lettering that specified the award enclosed, rather than gold paper with dark lettering. That could have made the lettering harder to read. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, not PwC, is responsible for the design and procurement of the envelopes. Whatever the reason, PwC was left searching for answers. As celebrities and guests hit the town for celebrations, Mr. Ryan spent the hours after the awards show speaking with Mr. Cullinan, Ms. Ruiz, members of the Academy and the show’s producers. “I spent the bulk of the night with Brian trying to understand what happened,” Mr. Ryan said. “There wasn’t much in terms of parties last night. ” Mr. Ryan and others at PwC were scrambling to contain the damage all night. The firm released a statement early Monday apologizing and taking responsibility for the mistake. Later in the day, Mr. Ryan wrote an email to PwC employees. It is too early to tell how the error will affect the PwC brand. A privately held partnership, PwC provides accounting, tax advisory and consulting services to most of the world’s largest corporations. It reported sales of $36 billion during its last fiscal year, up 7 percent from the previous year. The entertainment and media sector accounted for just 4. 2 percent of sales. PwC would not comment on its financial arrangement with the Academy, and Mr. Ryan said that there had not been any discussions about whether its longstanding contract was in jeopardy. PwC, which said earlier this month that it planned to hire an advertising agency to help promote some of its services, recently selected   for those efforts. That marketing work will be separate from any ad campaign the company may plan in the wake of the Oscars  . The company promotes the firm’s longstanding relationship with the Academy Awards on its website. One video posted there, introducing Mr. Cullinan and Ms. Ruiz, began with the line, “The reason we were even first asked to take on this role was because of the reputation PwC has in the marketplace for being a firm of integrity, of accuracy and confidentiality. ” It went on to note that the relationship was “symbolic of how we’re thought of beyond this role and how our clients think of us. ” But how clients think of PwC may change. Mr. Gilman, the crisis communications specialist, said he was curious to see if PwC kept the Oscars contract. “They have branded themselves around this event saying, ‘We’re trusted’  —   that’s the implication. Now I think that will take a hit. ”	1
79	This article includes spoilers for the current season of “The Walking Dead. ” “The Walking Dead,” which returns from its winter break on Sunday, began its seventh season with a bludgeoning for the ages, a double murder that turned the stomachs of even longtime fans inured to the show’s splatter factor. It didn’t get any better from there, as Rick and the Gang (along with the rest of us) endured seven more weeks of misery and subjugation by the new baddie Negan and his Saviors, before finally seeming to rebound in the midseason finale. Are our heroes ready to overthrow their tormentors? Let’s consider this and several additional questions leading into Sunday’s second half premiere. Glenn and Abraham were the big ones, of course. We also lost Spencer and Olivia, but they were pretty marginal. Daryl and Eugene were taken by the Saviors, but Daryl escaped. Glenn and Abraham’s brutal deaths set a gloomy tone for the first half of the season, which was primarily about Rick and friends grieving the loss and being victimized by Negan and the Saviors. We also met some new groups, and   …     well, that was about it. But eventually enough was enough, and the midseason finale ended with the core good guys reuniting, determined to throw off the yoke of Savior oppression. The tagline for this half is Rise Up, so it seems like a safe bet. Perhaps the more pertinent question is, when will the revolt happen? Teasers find Rick on a diplomatic mission to bring groups like the Hilltop and the Kingdom into the effort. How long will it take to persuade them to join the fight? Hard to say. Will it all be resolved this season? Considering that Negan doesn’t seem to be going anywhere anytime soon, probably not. Season 7 has kicked off a new phase of “The Walking Dead” marked by colonies that are collaborating and clashing as civilization recreates itself in a postapocalyptic dawn. So far, in addition to the Saviors and Alexandria, we’ve met the weak but industrious Hilltop, led by the sniveling Gregory the Kingdom, led by the   poser King Ezekiel and Oceanside, an   group, led by the   Natania, who hates outsiders but has lots of guns. There are also the Wolves, a murderous gang that was a real problem last season but hasn’t been a factor in Season 7. So is that it? Or are there more introductions to come? Based on this season’s general   tendencies, it seems likely. O. K. it seems very likely. The boots in question, glimpsed in the midseason finale near the pond where Rick and Aaron found supplies, could very easily belong to someone from yet another group. In the last episode, we saw Saviors tending a herd of walkers, which may or may not be the same herd the Alexandrians loosed from the quarry at the beginning of Season 6. Whatever its provenance, the swarm seems sure to come into play somehow  —   we all know what Chekhov said about zombie herds hanging out on the highway. Carol has been a real bummer this season, moping through her scant few scenes as people like Morgan and King Ezekiel tried to breach the antisocial cocoon she’s spun around herself. They were unsuccessful, and after she’d sufficiently healed from her gunshot wound, Carol got herself a hermit’s hut on the outskirts of the Kingdom. You’ll recall that the mousy housewife turned stone killer reached a breaking point last season, and sought to distance herself from others so she wouldn’t have to kill again. Carol would seem to be too intelligent to believe such a policy is possible in a lawless hellscape, but perhaps we’ll learn that there’s more to it. Or maybe she just needed some me time. Maybe she’ll learn about Glenn and Abraham, and emerge from that cocoon as a battling butterfly of righteous vengeance. Whatever the case, here’s hoping she returns to the center of the show somehow, as it has suffered from the absence of both Carol and Melissa McBride, who plays her with grit and grace. Jeffrey Dean Morgan is electric in his performance, which is unfortunately also full of affected mannerisms  —   wild exclamations, an odd   move  —   that quickly grew tiresome. A big villain helps to give “The Walking Dead” focus, and Mr. Morgan has shown promise, so hopefully he and the writers will find the actual man behind the tics. What questions or hopes do you have for the second half of the season? Please share your thoughts in the comments.	1
39	FRANKFURT  —   Germans who never really warmed up to the euro may be able to sleep a little easier. After decades of being safeguarded overseas, the nation’s gold reserves  —   a large part of them, at least  —   are once again safe in Frankfurt. Not that the gold was ever in danger of being stolen, according to the Bundesbank, the German central bank, which is in charge of the reserves. But the Bundesbank said on Thursday that it had completed a planned transfer of some $13 billion in gold bars that for historical reasons had been stored in vaults deep below Lower Manhattan. Whether gold matters anymore is questionable in an age of Bitcoin and digital payments. Even paper money is losing importance. But at least for some Germans, many of them nostalgic for the deutsche mark, gold provides reassurance that the embattled euro is underpinned by something tangible. “From a scientific point of view you could say it’s no longer necessary,” Jörg Krämer, chief economist at Commerzbank in Frankfurt, said of the gold reserves. “However, credibility is very important. Gold is perceived as trustworthy. Therefore it still plays a role. ” During the Cold War, when the country was on the front lines of   conflict, West Germany moved large amounts of its reserves abroad out of fear they would be seized by an invading Soviet army. Even after the Berlin Wall fell in 1989, the gold stayed overseas. One reason it took so long to bring it back is that moving gold is not so easy. It is heavy and an obvious target for thieves. But the Bundesbank began repatriating some of the gold in 2013 after an official audit found shortcomings in the way the reserves were accounted for. The bank has been secretive about how it moved the gold, to discourage anyone who might try to steal it. The audit, in 2012, provoked a political outcry among Germans who were shocked to learn that much of their gold was stored not only in Manhattan but also in Paris and London. Rumors circulated that some of the gold was missing. Although there was no evidence of that, the Bundesbank announced a plan to return enough of the gold so that half the reserves would be stored at the central bank’s vaults in Frankfurt by 2020. That goal has almost been reached, with 48 percent of the gold already in Germany. A move involving 300 tons from New York was completed last year, three years ahead of schedule,   Thiele, a member of the Bundesbank’s executive board, said in its statement on Thursday. Gold bars accounting for more than   of the total reserves will remain in New York about 13 percent will stay in London. The Bundesbank plans to withdraw all the gold stored in Paris. It has already moved 283 tons, with 91 tons left to go. The rationale for leaving some of the gold in New York and London is that they are major trading centers, and the gold could be deployed quickly if the euro collapsed or some other catastrophic economic event occurred. So far, the only gold sold by the Bundesbank has been in the form of commemorative coins. Germans may feel safer with the gold in Frankfurt, but James Rickards, a gold expert and author of “The New Case for Gold,” said that removing the reserves from New York and London could destabilize the gold market. Central bank gold reserves are routinely leased to banks, which use them as the basis for securities linked to gold. Stored in Frankfurt, Mr. Rickards said, the gold is no longer in circulation, leaving less available for lease at a time when demand for gold securities is high. “There is less floating supply,” he said. “It makes the market more unstable. ” While gold’s value is mostly sentimental, Mr. Krämer of Commerzbank acknowledged that it still exerted a powerful influence on the human imagination. “Have you ever touched real gold?” he said. “It has a kind of fascination. Even as an economist I can feel this. ”	1
95	KABUL, Afghanistan  —   An armed mob that included relatives of a young woman who had eloped with her lover stormed a police station holding the couple in eastern Afghanistan over the weekend, then dragged the lovers off and killed them, officials and witnesses said. The mob wounded three police officers, one of them seriously, the officials and witnesses said Sunday and Monday in providing accounts of the couple’s violent deaths, often called honor killings. The woman, Fatiha, 18, was described as having been married against her will and eloping instead with a young man, Hedayatullah, believed to be in his early 20s, from a neighboring village in Wama District of Nuristan Province. But on Saturday the police caught and arrested the couple on suspicion of adultery. Within hours an armed mob formed at the police station, led by Fatiha’s husband and his family, but also including her brothers and cousins, the officials and witnesses said. The authorities said there were only 30 police officers at the station facing a mob of 250 to 300 heavily armed men. “If police had fired bullets at the people, a massacre could have happened,” said Hafiz Abdul Qayoom, the governor of Nuristan, claiming the police had no option but to surrender the couple to the mob, especially after three officers had suffered gunshot wounds from the angry crowd. Enayatullah, the district governor in Wama, who like many Afghans uses only one name, said the couple were apparently killed soon after they had been taken out of the police station. “We asked for additional police, but the road to the district was closed due to snow,” he said. “If the police had resisted more, a disaster would have taken place. ” Salam Khan, 22, a witness from Fatiha’s village,    said he saw what had happened to the couple after the police surrendered them. “Some of Fatiha’s relatives, her cousins, were beating her with their fists and saying, ‘Why did you do this?’ Then her older brother got angry and shot her with a hunting rifle and her younger brother shot her with an  . I don’t know how many bullets they fired,” Mr. Khan said, speaking by telephone from the remote village. The man described by officials and witnesses as the woman’s husband, who was not identified, shot and killed Hedayatullah, with whom she had eloped, according to Mr. Khan. Hedayatullah was described as a member of the National Directorate of Security, Afghanistan’s paramilitary intelligence service, who was stationed in the village. It is common in many parts of rural Afghanistan for fathers to marry off their daughters without the daughter’s consent, even though both Afghan civil law and Islamic Shariah law require such consent. The authorities, however, often side with the families, and honor killings in cases where the girl refuses the marriage are common, although rarely publicized. The Nuristan case recalled a 2014 case in which a young couple from Bamian Province eloped to escape an arranged marriage, but last year fled to asylum in the United States to escape family retribution. “Such cases happen a lot in Nuristan, but they don’t come into the media,” said Hawa Alam Nuristani, a member of the Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission from Nuristan. This case came to attention because of the notoriety surrounding it and what Ms. Nuristani said was a high bride price paid to the girl’s father, reputedly 30 goats and seven cows. “In such cases when something goes wrong, people do not know other ways except killing, and women are not aware of their rights,” Ms. Nuristani said. Governor Qayoom said he was sending a delegation to the district to investigate the crime. “People there are ignorant, just like what people did in Kabul with Farkhunda,” he said. He was referring to a 2016 killing in which a female Islamic scholar was lynched by a mob over false rumors that she had burned a Quran. As of Monday in the Nuristan case, no one had been charged or arrested in the fatal shootings of the couple or the shootings of the police officers. Governor Qayoom said there had been reports of several recent cases of elopements in the district, so villagers were on the lookout for unaccompanied women. Saeedullah Payendazai Kamparwal, the chairman of the Nuristan provincial council and a native of Wama District, said Fatiha’s plan had been to climb the mountain above her house to a road on the other side, where Hedayatullah was awaiting her. Two young boys were suspicious after seeing her on her own, however, and they alerted police officers. The Afghan police typically consider an unmarried couple alone together to be guilty of adultery or attempted adultery, and the couple were presumably arrested for that. They claimed to be married but the police could tell they were from different districts and therefore did not believe them, according to Mr. Kamparwal’s account. Once word reached the families of the woman and her husband that she was being held, they formed the mob that stormed the police station, according to the authorities. “People said to the police, ‘Hand them over to us or we will raid the offices and break off relations with the government,’” Mr. Kamparwal said. The district is in a   part of a province where the Taliban also have some control. Saheb Dad Hamdard, the head of the Nuristan Journalists’ Shura, or council, cast doubt on claims that such large numbers of people had attacked the police station. “How can anyone believe that 250 to 300 people attacked? Wama District in total has four villages. Where would 300 people come from?” he said. “And where did they get arms? There’s no armed group in the village. ” Mr. Hamdard suggested that the authorities had acquiesced in turning the couple over to the families. Others, however, said that in such rural areas of Nuristan Province, people are often heavily armed.	1
455	WASHINGTON  —   President Trump, in his first address to a joint session of Congress, defended his tumultuous presidency on Tuesday and said he was eager to reach across party lines and put aside “trivial fights” to help ordinary Americans. He called on Congress to work with him on overhauling health care, changing the tax code and rebuilding the nation’s infrastructure and military. But he raised new questions about his policy priorities and how he plans to achieve them, especially on immigration. Only hours before his address, Mr. Trump had broken from his tough immigration stance in remarks at the White House, suggesting that legal status be granted to millions of undocumented immigrants who have not committed serious crimes. Many of Mr. Trump’s core supporters had denounced that approach as “amnesty” during the campaign. But in his speech, Mr. Trump never mentioned legalizing undocumented people and over all held to the    theme of his campaign. “The time is right for an immigration bill as long as there is compromise on both sides,” the president said at the White House, according to people in attendance who asked for anonymity because they were not authorized to speak about the meeting. The idea is a sharp break from the crackdown on immigrants in the United States illegally that Mr. Trump ordered in his first weeks in office and the   positions embraced by his core supporters that helped sweep him into the White House. But Mr. Trump made only a glancing reference to an immigration overhaul in his speech, calling for a new “ ” system that would admit only those able to support themselves financially. Over all he took a hard line on immigration, much as he had during the campaign. “As we speak, we are removing gang members, drug dealers and criminals that threaten our communities and prey on our citizens,” Mr. Trump said. “Bad ones are going out as I speak tonight and as I have promised. ” But in contrast with the dark themes of his inaugural address, Mr. Trump’s speech to Congress was a more optimistic vision of America and what he called the promises ahead. The themes were largely Republican orthodoxy, delivered soberly and almost verbatim from a prepared text. Mr. Trump read from Teleprompters and appeared restrained and serious. Republicans interrupted dozens of times with standing ovations, although Democrats mostly sat  . Mr. Trump presented himself as eager to put aside some of the vitriol of his presidency. “The time for small thinking is over, the time for trivial fights is behind us,” he said. “From now on, America will be empowered by our aspirations, not burdened by our fears. ” The most emotional moment of the speech came when Mr. Trump recognized Carryn Owens, the widow of William Ryan Owens, a member of a Navy SEAL team who was killed during a commando raid that the president authorized in Yemen. Ms. Owens sobbed as Mr. Trump said, “Ryan’s legacy is etched into eternity. ” Mr. Trump said that Defense Secretary Jim Mattis had guaranteed him that it was a “highly successful raid that generated large amounts of vital intelligence. ” Mr. Trump has been criticized for the raid, including by Mr. Owens’s father, with some arguing the operation was botched. Earlier in the day, Mr. Trump had blamed Mr. Owens’s death on “the generals” who oversaw the mission. Although Mr. Trump’s presidency has been defined by executive orders and pronouncements, his speech appeared to be an attempt to open a new phase and reflected his need for cooperation from Congress. “My administration wants to work with members in both parties to make child care accessible and affordable, to help ensure new parents have paid family leave, to invest in women’s health, and to promote clean air and clean water and rebuild our military infrastructure,” Mr. Trump said. The president has yet to propose major legislation to achieve his goals, with members of his cabinet and senior staff members divided over key elements of tax and health plans, and congressional Republicans split on how to structure them. By this point in his presidency, Mr. Obama had established an active  —   if not always friendly  —   working relationship with a Democratic Congress, having signed into law a $787 billion package of spending and tax cuts intended to stabilize the economy. Mr. Trump laid out the broad outlines of a health care overhaul that papered over divisions among Republicans about how to structure it, calling for a plan that uses tax credits and   savings accounts to help Americans buy insurance, and promising a “stable transition” from the existing system. Yet he made no mention of an array of challenges abroad, including Syria, North Korea and Russia. Nor did Mr. Trump criticize one of his favorite foils, the “fake news” media. He did pledge his full support for NATO after questioning the need for the alliance, and argued that his demands that nations contribute more money to NATO had paid off. “I can tell you that the money is pouring in,” Mr. Trump said without providing examples or specifics. “Very nice. ” Similarly, Mr. Trump offered no specifics on his suggestion earlier in the day that he might seek a comprehensive immigration overhaul. Such a move would be a significant turnaround for Mr. Trump, whose campaign rallies rang with shouts of “build the wall!” on the Mexican border. In January, he signed an executive order directing the deportation of any unauthorized immigrant who has committed a crime or falsified a document. The standard could apply to virtually any of the estimated 11 million people in the country illegally. In his comments to the television anchors at the White House, Mr. Trump went so far as to raise the idea of granting citizenship to young undocumented immigrants who had been brought to the United States as children, one person present said. Such a change would go well beyond the temporary work permits President Barack Obama offered them through a 2012 executive order. During his campaign, Mr. Trump criticized Mr. Obama’s directive as an “illegal amnesty,” and promised to immediately end the program if elected. But he has delayed acting on the matter since taking office and expressed sympathy for its beneficiaries, sometimes known as Dreamers. The White House did not dispute Mr. Trump’s remarks to the anchors, but Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the deputy press secretary, said she had not witnessed the conversation and was therefore unable to confirm it. “The president has been very clear in his process that the immigration system is broken and needs massive reform, and he’s made clear that he’s open to having conversations about that moving forward,” Ms. Sanders said. “Right now, his primary focus, as he has made over and over again, is border control and security at the border and deporting criminals from our country, and keeping our country safe, and those priorities have not changed. ” The president’s remarks about immigration came as he prepares to issue a new version of his executive order banning travel to the United States from seven predominantly Muslim countries and suspending the acceptance of refugees. The ban has been revised because of legal challenges. Mr. Trump defended that order in his address to Congress. “It is not compassionate, but reckless, to allow uncontrolled entry from places where proper vetting cannot occur,” Mr. Trump said. “Those given the high honor of admission to the United States should support this country and love its people and its values. We cannot allow a beachhead of terrorism to form inside America  —   we cannot allow our nation to become a sanctuary for extremists. ” The speech reflected the war Mr. Trump is fighting with himself and his inner circle. Even as he held out the possibility of legal status for millions of undocumented immigrants, Melania Trump, the first lady, was hosting the families of victims of violent crime by such immigrants  —   a way of highlighting the president’s belief that immigrants who lack legal status pose a grave threat to Americans and should be feared and removed, not embraced. Mr. Trump singled out the victims’ families, saying, “Your loved ones will never be forgotten. ” Giving the official Democratic response, former Gov. Steven L. Beshear of Kentucky offered an implicit contrast to the president by noting his own humble background and military service, accusing Mr. Trump and his “cabinet of billionaires and Wall Street insiders” of favoring banks and the wealthy over ordinary people. “You and your Republican allies in Congress seem determined to rip affordable health care away from millions of people who most need it,” Mr. Beshear said. “This isn’t a game. It’s life and death for people. ” For Mr. Trump’s speech, the president turned to the top advisers who helped develop his inaugural address: Stephen Miller, his senior policy adviser, and Stephen K. Bannon, his chief strategist. The two were still working on the speech late Monday, aides said. Mr. Miller and Mr. Bannon, both architects of the president’s tough immigration policies, were responsible for shaping the dark themes of the president’s speech on Inauguration Day.	1
377	DJIBOUTI  —   The two countries keep dozens of intercontinental nuclear missiles pointed at each other’s cities. Their frigates and fighter jets occasionally face off in the contested waters of the South China Sea. With no shared border, China and the United States mostly circle each other from afar, relying on satellites and cybersnooping to peek inside the workings of each other’s war machines. But the two strategic rivals are about to become neighbors in this   patch of East African desert. China is constructing its first overseas military base here  —   just a few miles from Camp Lemonnier, one of the Pentagon’s largest and most important foreign installations. With increasing tensions over China’s   efforts in the South China Sea, American strategists worry that a naval port so close to Camp Lemonnier could provide a   seat to the staging ground for American counterterror operations in the Arabian Peninsula and North Africa. “It’s like having a rival football team using an adjacent practice field,” said Gabriel Collins, an expert on the Chinese military and a founder of the analysis portal China SignPost. “They can scope out some of your plays. On the other hand, the scouting opportunity goes both ways. ” Established after the terror attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, Camp Lemonnier is home to 4, 000 personnel. Some are involved in highly secretive missions, including targeted drone killings in the Middle East and the Horn of Africa, and the raid last month in Yemen that left a member of the Navy SEALs dead. The base, which is run by the Navy and abuts Djibouti’s international airport, is the only permanent American military installation in Africa. Beyond surveillance concerns, United States officials, citing the billions of dollars in Chinese loans to Djibouti’s heavily indebted government, wonder about the   durability of an alliance that has served Washington well in its global fight against Islamic extremism. Just as important, experts say, the base’s construction is a milestone marking Beijing’s expanding global ambitions  —   with potential implications for America’s longstanding military dominance. “It’s a huge strategic development,” said Peter Dutton, professor of strategic studies at the Naval War College in Rhode Island, who has studied satellite imagery of the construction. “It’s naval power expansion for protecting commerce and China’s regional interests in the Horn of Africa,” Professor Dutton said. “This is what expansionary powers do. China has learned lessons from Britain of 200 years ago. ” Chinese officials play down the significance of the base, saying it will largely support antipiracy operations that have helped quell the threat to international shipping once posed by marauding Somalis. “The support facility will be mainly used to provide rest and rehabilitation for the Chinese troops taking part in escort missions in the Gulf of Aden and waters off Somalia, U. N. peacekeeping and humanitarian rescue,” the Defense Ministry in Beijing said in a written reply to questions. In addition to having 2, 400 peacekeepers in Africa, China has used its vessels to escort more than 6, 000 boats from many countries through the Gulf of Aden, the ministry said. China’s military has also evacuated its citizens caught in the world’s trouble spots. In 2011, the military plucked 35, 000 from Libya, and 600 from Yemen in 2015. As China’s navy has assumed these new roles far from home, its commanders have struggled to maintain vessels and resupply them with food and fuel. Capt. Liu Jianzhong, a former political commissar of a Chinese destroyer plying the Gulf of Aden, said the lack of a dedicated port in the region took a toll on personnel forced to spend long stretches at sea. “For six months, we didn’t reach the shore, and a lot of sailors had physical and psychological problems,” he told the   China Military Online. To that end, the new base will include a gym, the ministry said. Professor Dutton said Beijing would most likely try to “acclimatize” the world by using the facility for commercial purposes when it begins operating this year and then gradually increase the number and variety of warships that dock there. “It will be relatively incremental in the forward deployment of naval power. You are not going to see a Yokosuka,” he said, referring to the base for the United States Seventh Fleet in Japan. In its written answers, the ministry said that China was not budging from its “defensive” military policy and that the base did not indicate an “arms race or military expansion. ” In recent years, China has moved aggressively to increase its power projection capabilities through the rapid modernization of its navy. Military spending has soared, with Beijing’s defense budget expected to reach $233 billion by 2020, more than all Western European countries combined, and double the figure from 2010, according to Jane’s Defense Weekly. In 2016, the United States spent more than $622 billion on the military, Jane’s said. These days, Chinese naval vessels, including nuclear submarines, roam much of the globe, from contested waters of the Yellow Sea to Sri Lanka and San Diego. China’s decision to establish an overseas military installation comes as little surprise to those who have watched Beijing steadily jettison a   principle of noninterference in the affairs of other countries. The shift is an outgrowth of China’s evolution from an impoverished slumbering introvert to   mercantilist with economic interests across the globe. Half of China’s oil imports sail through the Mandeb Strait, the choke point off Djibouti that connects the Mediterranean Sea and the Indian Ocean. Across Africa,   companies are investing tens of billions of dollars in railways, factories and mines. And the millions of Chinese citizens who live and work overseas have come to expect that the government will look out for their interests  —   a point driven home in recent years when Beijing was forced to rescue Chinese nationals from   Libya and Yemen. “The facility in Djibouti is a very interesting lens through which to view China’s growing capabilities and ambitions,” said Andrew S. Erickson, an expert at China’s maritime transformation at the  Naval War College and the editor of the book “Chinese Naval Shipbuilding. ” “Not only will it give them a huge shot in the arm in terms of naval logistics, but it will also strengthen China’s image at home and abroad. ” A   encampment built adjacent to a new   commercial port, the   base is designed to house up to several thousand troops and will include storage structures for weapons, repair facilities for ships and helicopters, and five berths for commercial ships and one for military vessels. At the base’s front gate recently, Chinese workers in construction helmets waved away a reporter who tried to ask questions. China’s Defense Ministry declined a request to tour the site. American officials say they were blindsided by Djibouti’s decision, announced last year, to give China a   lease for the land. Just two years earlier, Susan Rice, the national security adviser under President Barack Obama, had flown here to head off a similar arrangement with Russia. Shortly afterward, the White House announced a   lease renewal that doubled its annual payments for Camp Lemonnier, to $63 million, and a plan to invest more than $1 billion to upgrade the installation. If the Pentagon’s current base restrictions are any guide, American and Chinese troops are unlikely to be sharing beers any time soon. American officials, citing possible security threats, keep most personnel confined to the   rectangle of scrubland, which is a   drive from the center of Djibouti city. It is a policy that stirs some discontent among those who often spend yearlong stints at Camp Lemonnier without venturing outside. By contrast, French military personnel can often be seen jogging through the city and socializing with locals. Americans who work for the United States Embassy also live in the community and say they feel little threat to their safety. Life on base can be monotonous, broken up by visits to the fitness center or meals at the camp’s Subway sandwich outlet. Capt. James Black, the camp’s commanding officer, said one of his primary challenges was to provide salubrious distractions for those stationed here. The distractions include free   a movie theater, Texas Hold ’em tournaments and the occasional soccer match with Italian and German troops. “We’re like a landlocked aircraft carrier,” Captain Black said during a recent tour of the installation, which is blasted in summer by broiling heat. “Part of my job is to create opportunities to give people a break and attend to their mental health needs. ” Local residents also crave more face time with the Americans. Some say Camp Lemonnier personnel could play a more active role in helping to alleviate Djibouti’s crushing poverty by building schools, painting hospitals or simply taking part in language exchanges. Others, like Mohamed Ali Basha, the owner of a   restaurant that serves grilled fish and massive discs of baked flatbread, said he would welcome business from military personnel. “I don’t understand why the Americans are so obsessed with security here, but I would be happy to close the restaurant for them if they would come,” Mr. Basha, 26, said. “Just call in advance. ” In interviews, Djiboutian officials expressed little concern that two strategic adversaries would be sharing space in a country the size of New Jersey. It helps that the Chinese are paying $20 million a year in rent on top of the billions they are spending to finance critical infrastructure, including ports and airports, a new rail line and a pipeline that will bring desperately needed drinking water from neighboring Ethiopia. Critics say the surge of loans, which amount to 60 percent of the country’s gross domestic product, raises concerns about China’s leverage over the Djibouti government should it fall behind on debt payments. “Such generous credit is itself a form of control,” said Mohamed Daoud Chehem, a prominent government critic. “We don’t know what China’s intentions really are. ” But on the city’s dusty, potholed streets, most people are pleased to see China joining the club of a   foreign militaries that have a presence here, among them Japan, Italy and Britain. Also here is a large contingent of French soldiers who stayed on after 1977, when the colony formerly known as French Somaliland gained independence. Abdirahman M. Ahmed, who runs Green Djibouti International, an environmental social enterprise, said many people viewed foreign militaries as a stabilizing force, given their country’s diminutive size, its lack of resources and the potential threats from neighbors like Ethiopia, Somalia and Eritrea, where expansionist sentiments continue to burble. “We don’t see any problem having the Chinese here,” he said. “They provide revenue and help play a deterrence to those who would love to annex Djibouti. ” The plethora of foreign troops, some say, also served as a bulwark against the jihadist violence that has destabilized other countries in the region. Djibouti, whose population of 900, 000 embraces a moderate form of Sunni Islam, has not been entirely spared: In 2014, a double suicide bombing at a downtown restaurant popular with foreigners killed a Turkish national and wounded 11 people. The Shabab, the   militant group, later claimed responsibility, saying the attack was motivated by the presence of so many Western troops in Djibouti. For American military strategists, the security implications of the Chinese base are unclear, though practically speaking, many experts say the military threat is minimal. “A port like this isn’t very defensible against attack,” said Philip C. Saunders, director of the Center for the Study of Chinese Military Affairs at the National Defense University. “It wouldn’t last very long in a war. ”	1
392	HAMAM   Iraq  —   One week after Iraqi forces began their push into western Mosul, American firepower is playing an essential role in softening the opposition from the Islamic State. The thunderous booms from howitzers near Hamam   a town along the Tigris River, are just part of the American military’s contribution to keeping the Iraqi offensive moving forward. Capt. Geoffrey Ross, who commands the unit of   artillery here, said his soldiers had been a lot busier than he had anticipated. “It’s considerably more than we thought we were going to shoot when we left Fort Hood,” he said on Saturday, as one of his howitzers hurled another round toward Mosul, 15 miles to the northwest. At Qayyarah Airfield West, a sprawling Iraq base 40 miles south of Mosul, a United States Army task force fires Himars   rockets at targets. Apache attack helicopters, equipped with Hellfire missiles, stand ready to carry out their missions from the base’s airfield. Not to mention the punishing airstrikes by American and allied warplanes and drones. A flurry of attacks were carried out by the   coalition in and around Mosul on Saturday, some involving the dropping of multiple bombs. That firepower, the decision to position American advisers closer to the fighting, and the determined efforts of the Iraqi forces themselves have yielded some notable gains. Iraq’s federal police have fully secured the Mosul airport, while Iraq’s elite counterterrorism service seized a nearby military base last week. That ground has been taken at a cost. Four Iraqis were killed in action and 53 wounded on Friday, according to an American official who requested anonymity to discuss the statistics, which have yet to be officially published. That is a small fraction of the approximately 500 dead and 3, 000 wounded that Iraqi forces suffered in their push to secure the eastern half of the city during an earlier,   offensive. But the toughest part of the battle  —   the    combat in the narrow streets of the old part of western Mosul  —   still lies ahead. The Islamic State’s military tactics have also added to the challenge. With the encouragement of the Americans, the Iraqi strategy has been to mount an attack on multiple axes to present the militants with more problems than they can handle. But the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, has responded at times by concentrating its firepower on what it believes to be the Iraqis’ main line of attack. In ISIS’ version of combined arms warfare, it has sent drones equipped with bombs even as it lobbed mortars and deployed suicide car bombers, whom the militants use as a primitive but often effective way to deliver   munitions. Iraqi troops have been spooked by the ISIS drones, which sometimes hover in swarms of three to five. Neither the American nor the Iraqi military has an easy remedy. Trying to jam the drones might interfere with the Iraqis’ own communications, and it is not always easy to shoot them out of the sky. So the United States military has used its firepower to try to mitigate the drone problem, just as it targeted ISIS’ car bomb factories, mortar teams and command posts. On Saturday, the   command announced that it had struck a “staging area” for launching drones and a cache of the weapons. Qayyarah West, which was once known as Saddam Airbase and is called   by American soldiers, is a pivotal base for the Mosul offensive. Runways at the air base, captured from the Islamic State in July, have been repaired by American combat engineers, which makes it an important logistics hub and a useful platform for projecting power. First Lt. Mary Floyd, a    officer who was raised in South Carolina, has been focused on doing exactly that. The commander of a platoon that fires Himars rockets, she helped flatten a   building the American military says Islamic State militants were using as a command post shortly before the Iraqis began their offensive to take western Mosul. Over the past week, she said, her platoon launched rockets toward Mosul 10 to 20 times. Military officers have a name for the two platoons that fire Himars that are deployed at the base: Task Force Thor. Firing rockets into a densely populated city is a tricky proposition. But the rockets’ satellite guidance, perpendicular angle of attack and the fact that they can accommodate a relatively small warhead have led the military to turn to it during previous urban fights, including the 2006 battle for Ramadi and the 2007 struggle for the control of Haifa Street in Baghdad. The United States is not the only nation supporting the Iraqis by firing artillery. French artillery has been active as well. Hamam   was taken by Iraqi forces in November, and a mass grave of ISIS victims was later uncovered near an agricultural college there. Now, United States Army crews live and even sleep inside their Paladin artillery units, waiting for orders to fire. Captain Ross declined to say precisely how many rounds his soldiers had fired. But he said they were ready to shoot day and night and could “range the entire city. ”	1
354	OLATHE, Kan.  —   “The Jameson guys,” as some on the staff at Austins Bar and Grill knew the pair, were on the patio on Wednesday evening. It was hardly unusual: Srinivas Kuchibhotla and Alok Madasani, two immigrants from India, often enjoyed an   whiskey at the bar they had adopted as a hangout. Adam W. Purinton was also there, tossing ethnic slurs at the two men and suggesting they did not belong in the United States, other customers said. Patrons complained, and Mr. Purinton was thrown out. But a short time later, he came back in a rage and fired on the two men, the authorities said. Mr. Kuchibhotla was killed, and Mr. Madasani was wounded, along with a    man who had tried to apprehend the gunman, who fled. Mr. Purinton, 51, was extradited to Kansas from Missouri on Friday, and he is charged with premeditated   murder and two counts of attempted premeditated   murder. The attack, which the federal and local authorities are investigating as a possible hate crime, reverberated far beyond both states. It raised new alarms about a climate of hostility toward foreigners in the United States, where President Trump has made clamping down on immigration a central plank of his “America first” agenda. The White House strongly rejected the notion that there might be any connection between the shooting and the new administration’s sharp language about immigration. “People are devastated,” said Somil Chandwani, a friend of the two victims who lives in Overland Park, Kan. “I wouldn’t say they are angry. They have a sense of insecurity at the moment. People are trying to find answers. ” A charging document released on Friday gave no details about the motive for the shooting. Law enforcement officials in Kansas, citing the continuing investigation and judicial ethics standards, said little about the episode. Still, the F. B. I. ’s role in the inquiry suggested that officials had found some evidence that could eventually lead to civil rights charges in connection with the shooting, which occurred around 7:15 p. m. Wednesday. “He snapped, and this is not his typical self,” the suspect’s mother, Marsha Purinton, said before declining further comment. In a brief phone interview on Friday night, Mr. Madasani described the remarks made Wednesday by the man sitting near him and Mr. Kuchibhotla at the restaurant. “He asked us what visa are we currently on and whether we are staying here illegally,” Mr. Madasani said. (Both men were educated in the United States and were working here legally.) “We didn’t react,” Mr. Madasani said. “People do stupid things all the time. This guy took it to the next level. ” Mr. Madasani said he went in to get a manager, and by the time he returned to the patio, the man was being escorted out. After Mr. Purinton was thrown out, Jeremy Luby, 41, a software developer, said he offered to pick up the tab for the two men, who thanked him during a brief conversation about work and cultural differences. “It was wrong what happened to them,” Mr. Luby said. “I thought it was a nice gesture to say, ‘I’m sorry someone was being rude to you like that. ’” After the shooting began, another patron, Ian Grillot, 24, said he tried to count the shots while he hid under a table. Thinking the gunman had run out of ammunition, Mr. Grillot said, he confronted him, only to be shot in the hand and the chest. “It wasn’t right, and I didn’t want the gentleman to potentially go after somebody else,” Mr. Grillot said in a video released by the hospital where he received treatment. “He did it once. What would stop him from doing it again?” The shots echoed around the area, and Chris Lacross soon emerged from a store a few doors down to an unimaginable scene: an emergency medical technician performing CPR on a man lying in the doorway of the bar’s front patio, where tables and chairs had been flipped over, and someone was shouting that they needed towels. Another man took off his shirt and applied pressure to the wound of another victim, who was writhing in pain, said Mr. Lacross, who allowed some people to use a store restroom to wash away spattered blood. Within minutes, an emergency dispatcher, in a transmission archived by the Broadcastify website, told officers, “We’re being advised the suspect’s name is Adam, and he’s a white male wearing a white shirt with military medals. ” Capt. Sonny Lynch, the deputy chief of police in Clinton, Mo. where Mr. Purinton was arrested at an Applebee’s restaurant, said a bartender there called the police after a customer confessed to his involvement in a shooting hours earlier. “He was talking to her  —   ‘I’m on the run I’m hiding out from the law’  —   so she stuck around,” Captain Lynch said of the bartender. “She just hung out there talking to the guy until he said, ‘I shot those guys, and that’s why I’m hiding out from the police. ’” Mr. Purinton was arrested without incident, Captain Lynch said, and invoked his constitutional rights. It was not clear whether he had a lawyer. Mr. Purinton spent time in the Navy and, according to a website where veterans can list their military records, was deployed aboard the Long Beach, a missile cruiser, from 1988 to 1990. He later worked for the Federal Aviation Administration but left the agency in 2000, a spokeswoman said. In Johnson County, Kan. at least, he has had few   with law enforcement. Court records showed a limited history: a speeding ticket in 2008, as well as a 1999   charge that was dismissed. A neighbor, Lisa Puckett, said that Mr. Purinton was frequently intoxicated but that news of a shooting was stunning. “We always wondered if he might hurt himself, but we didn’t think he would hurt someone else,” she said. The dead man, Mr. Kuchibhotla, worked for Garmin, a GPS navigation and communications device company. One of the wounded men, Mr. Madasani, like Mr. Kuchibhotla in his early 30s, also worked for Garmin, according to the Indian government. On Friday, counselors were at the company’s campus in Olathe, a hub of South Asian immigrants where 84 languages are spoken in the local school district. Speaking to reporters on Friday at the Garmin headquarters, Mr. Kuchibhotla’s widow, Sunayana Dumala, said she had long been worried by shootings she read about in the newspaper. “I, especially, I was always concerned, are we doing the right thing of staying in the United States of America?” she said. “But he always assured me that only good things happen to good people. ” Now, Ms. Dumala said, she needed “an answer from the government” about what “they’re going to do to stop this hate crime. ” Mr. Madasani’s father, Jagan Mohan Reddy, a government engineer in Hyderabad, India, said his family was in shock. He said he did not know whether he would ask Mr. Madasani, who received a graduate degree from the University of   City, and another son living in the United States to leave the country. “We have to think it over,” he said. “My sons are not new to America. They have been staying there for the last 10 to 12 years. This is a new situation, and they are the best judges. ” Mr. Madasani, who has been released from the hospital, said he was recovering physically and mentally. “I’m definitely doing much better, but it’s not over yet,” he said. On Friday, Mr. Kuchibhotla’s killing and the wounding of Mr. Madasani led to a chorus of fury in India, where the attack dominated the news media to such an extent that the top American diplomat in the country was compelled to issue a statement condemning what she described as a “tragic and senseless act. ” In Washington, the White House press secretary, Sean Spicer, rejected any link between Mr. Trump’s policy agenda and the shooting, which many Indians believed might have been inspired by the president’s harsh tone on immigration. The Justice Department is under pressure to bring federal charges in the case. Moussa Elbayoumy, the board chairman for the Kansas chapter of the Council on   Relations, said the government should “consider filing hate crime charges in order to send a strong message that violence targeting religious or ethnic minorities will not be tolerated. ” On Friday night, a diverse crowd of more than 400 gathered to grieve at First Baptist Church down the street from the bar. They offered their prayers to the Kuchibhotlas and the Madasanis, characterized the shooting as an anomaly in an otherwise peaceful, tolerant suburb and vowed they would not let that change. “As a community, we are still shocked, devastated, and angry,”  Mayor Michael Copeland said. “But this is not how this ends. This is not our Olathe. ” He added, “One evil act does not divide a united community. ” Mr. Purinton was scheduled to appear in court on Monday. Austins, meanwhile, planned to reopen on Saturday.	1
595	 There has been heated controversy over the recent legislation implemented by the leaders of the state of North Carolina.The state made headlines and created a relative uproar after maintaining its stance on the LGBT community, essentially vetoing a bill that would protect those who are gay, bisexual, and transgender from discrimination.The House Bill 2, known as HB2, has been criticized as being discriminatory toward transgender people. The statewide policy bans individuals from using public bathrooms that do not correspond to their biological sex and prohibits cities from passing anti-discrimination ordinances to protect gay and transgender identity, per CNN.Thursday afternoon at approximately 4:57pm ET, North Carolina Police detained a man, later to be identified as Dallas Cowboys quarterback Tony Romo, for using the men’s restroom in the Charlotte-Douglas International Airport.Police say they received a complaint from numerous bystanders and patrons inside the bathroom complaining of a person who didn’t belong there.When asked how police recognized that the man who they received complaints about may have been a women, they pointed towards the Cowboys apparel Romo was wearing at the time. “It was a dead giveaway,” said officer Mike Roseman.Under the state law, Romo was technically prohibited from using the men’s bathroom even if he identified as a man.In Romo’s statement to police, the QB said, “I don’t know what I was thinking. I could have swore I saw the proper sign but it was apparently something else. I have a hard time reading things. It happens a lot. Even off the field. Bathroom signs? Try defenses.” He added, “I was just trying to carry on with my business when you guy’s intercepted me.”	0

589	 A white, 11-year-old girl filed federal lawsuits Monday claiming she identifies as a 50-year-old Salish Indian chief and deserves all the entitlements and benefits of an esteemed tribal member.Bambie Buffy Remington, originally from Orange County, CA., said she started identifying as a middle-aged tribal chief after watching a rerun of the TV show F-Troop and felt great compassion for the Native Americans, known on the show as “Indians”“The Native Americans on the TV show were noble and outsmarted the military leaders who supported barbaric means of law enforcement,” said Bambie while wearing her eagle feather headdress. “I felt a great personal tie even though we have no common blood relatives but had the same Moon Mother.” Legal experts say that the BIA and federal governments might have their hands tied since the passing of the law that allows people of any gender to use a bathroom of the sex they identify with, thus creating a new federally protected group.“We already have Identity Rights Groups and Political Action Committees to protect identity rights,” said a federal government official who asked to remain anonymous because he was afraid of reprisals from his own parents. “We are sure, especially under a new Clinton administration, that Identiphiles, as they want to be called, will be our next protected group.”Bambie’s lawyer, Gloria All-Red, is already preparing other lawsuits, she said.One will be for Kim Su, a 40-year-old Korean immigrant woman living in Seattle, who claims she identifies as a 65-year-old retired white woman which makes her eligible to collect Social Security benefits.A third case revolves around Iggy ‘Insane’ Ignokowichowianski, 51, of Portlandia, a multiple felon who will file several claims, All-Red said.The first claim is that he identifies as a horny 17-year-old boy which would soften the sentencing for his sexual assault charge against a horny 16-year-old girl.His second claim is that he started identifying as a woman, which would mean he would be transferred to a high-security woman’s prison on the other side of the all-gay facility, All-Red said.	0

144	SEOUL, South Korea  —   When North Korea held a state funeral for its leader, Kim   in 2011, one son was conspicuously absent. The absence of Kim    —   the eldest son of the family, who was bound by Korean tradition to preside over the funeral  —   was all the evidence outside analysts needed to see how isolated he had become from the center of power in North Korea, the world’s most secretive regime. Never fully accepted by his family, sidelined by his powerful stepmother and haunted by fears of assassins, Mr. Kim lived much of his life wandering abroad, in Moscow, Geneva, Beijing, Paris and Macau, the Chinese gambling enclave. On Monday, Mr. Kim, 45, met his end at Kuala Lumpur International Airport in Malaysia. According to the National Intelligence Service of South Korea, he was poisoned by two women who appeared to be carrying out an assassination order from Pyongyang, the North Korean capital. Mr. Kim died on his way to the hospital. Two women have been detained in connection with the killing. It remains uncertain if Mr. Kim was traveling alone or if bodyguards were present. It was also unclear how many people were involved in the attack. Grainy footage released on Wednesday showed a woman suspected of being one of the assassins, who appeared to be of Asian descent and wore a shirt emblazoned with “LOL” in large letters, before she fled the airport. The Royal Malaysia Police announced late Wednesday afternoon that they had arrested a woman that morning and that she had been carrying a Vietnamese passport in Terminal 2, where the attack occurred. They said she was “positively identified” from   video, and was alone at the time of her arrest. She was identified as Doan Thin Hoang, 28, according to the inspector general of the police, Khalid Abu Bakar. On Thursday, the Malaysian police said they had detained a second suspect, a woman with an Indonesian passport. A police official told the Bernama news agency that more arrests were expected. The authorities also said that an autopsy on Mr. Kim had been completed. There were no markers or police tape at Terminal 2 on Wednesday to indicate that a crime had been committed. Airport workers said that they had been ordered not to discuss the case. South Korea’s acting president, Hwang   said on Wednesday that his government was working with the Malaysian authorities to find the assailants. But officials in Seoul quickly pointed fingers at Mr. Kim’s half brother, the North Korean leader Kim   who has ordered the executions of  a number of senior officials, including his own uncle, who have been deemed potential challenges to his authority. Ever since Kim   succeeded his father in 2011, “there has been a standing order” to assassinate his half brother, Lee   the director of the South’s National Intelligence Service, said during a   briefing at the National Assembly, according to lawmakers who attended it. “This is not a calculated action to remove Kim   because he was a challenge to power per se, but rather reflected Kim  ’s paranoia,” Mr. Lee was quoted as saying. Kim   wanted his half brother killed, Mr. Lee said, and there was an assassination attempt against him in 2012. Mr. Kim was so afraid of assassins that he begged for his life in a letter to his half brother in 2012. “Please withdraw the order to punish me and my family,” Mr. Kim was quoted as saying in the letter. “We have nowhere to hide. The only way to escape is to choose suicide. ” Mr. Lee said that Kim   had no power base inside North Korea, where Kim   had swiftly established his monolithic rule with what the South called a reign of terror. Kim   arrived in Malaysia last week, Mr. Lee said. He was in line at the airport to check in for a flight to Macau on Monday morning when he was attacked by the two women, Mr. Lee said, citing security camera footage from the airport. The women fled the airport in a taxi, Mr. Lee said. If North Korea’s involvement is proved, Washington could face intense pressure to put the country back on its list of nations that sponsor terrorism, said Cheong   an analyst at the Sejong Institute, a think tank in South Korea. North Korea was first put on the terrorism list after the South caught a woman from the North who confessed to planting a bomb on a South Korean airliner that exploded over the Indian Ocean, near Myanmar, in 1987. The North was taken off the list in 2008, after a deal aimed at ending its nuclear program. South Korea’s military plans to use loudspeakers along the shared Korean border to inform North Koreans of Mr. Kim’s killing and of their government’s brutality, a South Korean news agency, Yonhap, reported on Wednesday. The Defense Ministry declined to confirm the report. “By assassinating Kim   Kim   may have removed a thorn in the side, but it will further isolate his country,” Mr. Cheong said. “It is also expected to worsen his country’s relations with China, which has been protecting his brother. ” Kim  ’s life illuminates the hidden intrigue in the Kim family, which has ruled North Korea for almost seven decades. While the lives of the rest of the family remained shrouded in mystery, Mr. Kim, the oldest of three known sons of Kim   has been the closest thing the isolated Stalinist state has had to an international playboy. He was often seen with fashionably dressed women in international airports and spent much of his time in  casinos in Macau, where he also kept an expensive house. Outside analysts often saw him as a possible candidate to replace Kim   if the North Korean leadership imploded and China, traditionally an ally, sought a replacement in its client state. Chinese experts on North Korea said they doubted that Kim   had special security protection from Beijing. “Chinese elites had no expectation this guy could play an important political role,” said Cheng Xiaohe, an associate professor of international relations at Renmin University. “If China wanted to use him as an alternative leader, China would have offered good protection, but this assassination shows he had no security protection. ” In Macau, where Mr. Kim was headed, he was safe just by being there, said Zhang Baohui, director of the Center for Asian Pacific Studies at Lingnan University in Hong Kong. “Macau is part of China and is a safe haven in itself,” he said. Mr. Kim was a prince in exile with little chance of returning home, analysts and officials in South Korea said. His wife and a daughter and son are in Macau under Chinese protection, Mr. Lee said. The South Korean intelligence agency did not disclose how it had obtained the letter from Mr. Kim begging his half brother to spare his life. But government sources said that emails Mr. Kim sent home through North Korean embassies had been obtained in a hacking operation. In one of the emails, they said, Mr. Kim bitterly complained that the North Korean government stopped sending him cash after his father died and Kim   took over. In 2012, a news report said Mr. Kim was thrown out of a luxury Macau hotel, unable to pay a $15, 000 bill. The Kim family has never been known for its togetherness. Kim  ’s mother, Sung   a decorated “people’s actress,” was already married and the mother of a child when Kim   forced her to divorce her novelist husband to marry him. Kim   adored his first son, Kim  . He once seated his young son at his desk and told him, “This is the place where you will one day give orders,” according to Lee   a relative who defected to the South in 1982. But Kim  ’s grandfather, the North’s founding president, Kim   never approved of the marriage. “My father was keeping highly secret the fact that he was living with my mother, who was married, a famous movie actress, so I couldn’t get out of the house or make friends,” Mr. Kim was quoted as saying in a 2012 book by a Japanese journalist. “That solitude from childhood may have made me what I am now, preferring freedom. ” Mr. Kim was born in secret, and when his mother fell out of favor with Kim   and was forced to live in Moscow, he was left in the care of her sister. He was later sent to Geneva, where he learned English and French. (His mother was alone in Moscow when she died in 2002.) Kim   would later begin a relationship with Ko   a star of Pyongyang’s premier opera, who gave birth to Kim   and then Kim  . According to a Japanese sushi chef who published a 2003 memoir about his experience working for the Kim family, Kim   was by that time the father’s favorite. Kim   squandered what little chance he may have had to succeed his father when he embarrassed Pyongyang in 2001 he was caught trying to enter Japan on a fake passport from the Dominican Republic. He told Japanese investigators that he wanted to visit Tokyo Disneyland. But rumors of intrigue never left Mr. Kim, as analysts speculated that if the young, inexperienced Kim   failed to meet the expectations of   generals, they might summon home the eldest brother. In a way, Mr. Kim helped fuel such rumors. In the 2012 book by the Japanese journalist, Mr. Kim called his younger brother “a figurehead. ”	1

275	FAIRVIEW, Tenn.  —   Representative Marsha Blackburn may have expected to draw a friendly crowd by scheduling a town   meeting in a Tennessee community that had voted overwhelmingly for President Trump, but she instead faced a   blast of disapproval on Tuesday. Ms. Blackburn, an   Republican, was sharply questioned about a wide range of issues that have unsettled Mr. Trump’s first month in office, including health care, the environment, education and the president’s links to Russia. At many moments, her replies elicited boos or shouts to “tell the truth. ” “We’re not stupid you have to do better,” Renee Armand said at one point, interrupting Ms. Blackburn as she was defending the new education secretary, Betsy DeVos, for bringing “a true love of education reform. ” Ms. Blackburn, who represents a safe Republican seat west of Nashville, was among the latest wave of Washington lawmakers to face angry constituents in what, inevitably but perhaps prematurely, has been called a progressive echo of the Tea Party anger that boiled over in town halls eight years ago. During the first weeklong recess of the new Congress, many Republicans have chosen not to hold events at all, wary of protests that might greet them. Others gamely faced the music, including Representative Dennis A. Ross of Florida and Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, who faced largely hostile audiences on Tuesday in districts that, like Ms. Blackburn’s, had strongly endorsed Mr. Trump at the polls. At one point, Mr. Grassley, a   senator, was offered a gift from a    Democratic pig farmer named Chris Petersen: a bottle of Tums. “You’re going to need them in the next few years,” Mr. Petersen told the senator, drawing laughter from a crowd packed into a room at a firehouse in Iowa Falls, north of Des Moines. Mr. Grassley later quipped that “the only time I need Tums is when I have chocolate ice cream before I go to bed. ” Anxious and agitated constituents of Mr. Grassley’s clapped and yelled out in frustration in a rural county that voted overwhelmingly for Mr. Trump. Mr. Petersen, the vice chairman of the Iowa Democratic Party’s Rural Caucus, gave a stern warning about the repeal of the Affordable Care Act. “With all due respect, sir, you’re the man that talked about the death panels,” Mr. Petersen said. “We’re going to create one great big death panel in this country. ” Republicans have accused the protesters who have roiled town   meetings of not representing a true   outpouring but instead being an AstroTurf movement paid by shadowy groups. Mr. Trump added his own voice to the criticism on Tuesday. The forums have faced threats of violence, prompting some lawmakers, citing security concerns, to cancel events after being briefed by law enforcement. But Mr. Grassley suggested the crowds were no less bona fide than the more friendly ones he usually gets when he makes his annual tour of all 99 Iowa counties. “I want to make clear it’s all legitimate,” he told reporters after his second meeting of the day, in Garner, Iowa. “If Hillary Clinton had been elected president, there’d be people from the conservative end of the spectrum to probably be doing the same thing. ” Mr. Ross, one of the most conservative members of Congress and an enthusiastic defender of Mr. Trump’s, was called a liar by participants in his town hall in Clermont, Fla. about 20 miles west of Orlando. They held signs reading “Disagree,” “Nyet My President” and “No Pipeline. ” Elected in 2010 as part of the Tea Party wave that challenged the political establishment and fought to repeal the Affordable Care Act, Mr. Ross has embraced Mr. Trump’s agenda, including securing the nation’s borders. A few supporters of Mr. Ross’s walked out of his meeting, saying they were upset that the congressman was unable to talk without catcalls. One protester tried to reason with the passionate crowd, urging people to let Mr. Ross speak and adding that if they were angry, the correct response was to vote. “But in the meantime, let him talk so we can hold him accountable,” she added. “This is democracy in action,” Mr. Ross said at one point. “There are a lot of people who want to participate in the dialogue. I only ask that you give them that respect and civility. ” But most of the people in the crowd wanted to be heard, loud and clear, on a litany of issues. One woman said she could not understand how Mr. Ross could oppose the presence of undocumented immigrants, given that the district was dependent on agriculture. “It’s so detrimental to our identity as a state and to the economy,” she said before disappearing into the crowd. Back in Tennessee, a number of those facing Ms. Blackburn were rallied by the local branch of Indivisible, a national movement started by Democratic activists. The group had held two meetings to discuss which issues to raise. One of the organizers, Elizabeth TeSelle, a university administrator, disavowed the Tea Party comparison. She said Indivisible supporters were not seeking to push moderate Democrats further to the left, or to oust them by running more extreme candidates against them in primaries. “My concern is what the Tea Party ended up spawning was Trump,” Ms. TeSelle said. Ms. Blackburn, one of Mr. Trump’s   supporters in the House of Representatives during last year’s campaign, defended him on nearly every issue raised by critics. One man called Stephen K. Bannon, the president’s chief strategist, “a notorious white nationalist. ” Ms. Blackburn replied, “My interactions with him have all been fine. ” A high school senior, Taylor Ayres, asked how she could support Ms. DeVos, “someone who doesn’t have real knowledge in the education field. ” Ms. Blackburn said coolly, “She is going to do a fine job. ” Bruce Sullivan asked why Republicans had no real replacement for the Affordable Care Act after seven years. Ms. Blackburn referred him to a   video from 2010 in which she and other Republicans had met with President Barack Obama to seek a bipartisan program. “I appreciate that,” Mr. Sullivan said, a hint of sarcasm in his voice. “You are showing us you have been in Washington too long. ” At least one lawmaker, Senator Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, had a quieter day. Appearing before a few hundred residents in a high school cafeteria in Denham Springs, La. after the students had spilled out into a warm afternoon, Mr. Cassidy, a Republican, spoke to anxious residents mostly about their more pressing concern: flood relief. Their parish, Livingston, had received more than 25 inches of rain in three days during a catastrophic flood in August, overwhelming the rivers and devastating the city. Protesters said they had steered clear of Mr. Cassidy’s forum out of respect for the flood victims. As Mr. Cassidy answered queries submitted on slips of paper, a woman asked if he would take questions from the floor, saying she worried they had been screened. As if to prove that they were not, Mr. Cassidy read aloud a question about Mr. Trump’s tax returns, eliciting applause and cheers from many of those assembled. “Looks like we have some folks who don’t like Donald Trump,” he said to more cheers. “A lot of us do. ”	1

433	(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the  .) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. In his first address to Congress, President Trump called for help in rebuilding the nation’s infrastructure and military. Mr. Trump said he was eager to reach across partisan lines and put aside “trivial fights” in the interest of helping Americans, but he was short on details. He signaled a new openness to granting legal status to millions of undocumented immigrants who have not committed serious crimes. Here is a video and transcript, analysis and our  . _____ 2. An online debate erupted over a photo of Kellyanne Conway kneeling on a couch in the Oval Office as Mr. Trump met with leaders of historically black colleges and universities. Some called it a lack of decorum, while others pointed to photos of Mr. Obama with his feet on his desk. Also getting a lot of attention: The Obamas signed a book deal with Penguin Random House. The terms were not disclosed, but industry experts said it probably stretched well into eight figures. _____ 3. Jeff Sessions, making his first official speech as U. S. attorney general, promised a   approach to drug trafficking and illegal immigration. Mr. Trump is expected to emphasize the same theme, which forms the backbone of a vision of remaking America shared by Mr. Sessions and Stephen Bannon, the chief White House strategist. Today’s episode of The Daily podcast explores the roles those men played in shaping Mr. Trump’s immigration policy, and also continues the story of a young Afghan refugee who made a dash for the U.

Colorectal cancers, considered a disease of the aging, are on the rise in adults in their 20s and 30s. The spike, at a time when rates of the disease are on the wane in older people, is both baffling and worrisome, scientists say. Diagnosis is sometimes delayed as the disease advances, because doctors simply don’t suspect that a young patient with digestive complaints like diarrhea or constipation, cramping and abdominal pain, or bloody stool could have cancer.

In many towns, shoppers have been flocking to newly built shopping center, leaving the historic city centers decaying and pocked with commercial vacancies  —   much as U.

And they have decided to go after supplies that potential masturbators might need.Bob Whitbread, LDS spokesperson, said the church is going to urge Utah Gov. Gary Herbert to impose limits on the sale of Vaseline and Kleenex.“If a young man is buying large supplies of these items, it’s evident he has fallen prey to masturbation,” Whitbread said.

969	 Hollywood executives are “blood-thirsty Satanists” who “ritually abuse children in the industry“, according to Macaulay Culkin, who claims he only got out alive because he was a “smart, suspicious kid” and he “got too famous to be killed like some of the other kids.”“You learn very early to recognize which of them want to abuse you, and which of them have even darker tastes,” Macaulay Culkin said, explaining that “the worst of them wear shoes made out of the skin of children that they ritually murdered.“Speaking on radio in Paris, France, Culkin said “Have you seen leather products made from human skin? It has a very unusual, distinctive look. I learned at a very young age to identify it.“ Hollywood is controlled by Satanic pedophiles according to Macaulay Culkin, who opened up in a radio interview, describing how one Hollywood executive tried to get him hooked on crack at the age of 11 and boasted that his tailor-made leather shoes were made from the skin of dead child star Heather O’Rourke.[…]The explosive claims made by Culkin were reported by French media including Les Echos, a newspaper, however all reports were quickly deleted within an hour of appearing online. Macaulay Culkin claims Hollywood studio executives rape and murder child stars and use their skin to make boots, belts and wallets that they use as “skin trophies.”	0
576	 On Thursday, over 5,000 UCLA students held a candlelight vigil for fallen ISIS soldiers whose lives were cut short by drone strikes or machine gun fire in Syria and Iraq. Humanities professor Thomas T. Turnbolt organized the nighttime vigil; he had found solidarity with ISIS combatants during a year-long sojourn to Syria, where he witnessed the harsh and inhumane conditions under which ISIS soldiers operate. Turnbolt rejected the word “terrorist,” preferring the word “freedom fighters” to describe his heavily-armed, bomb wielding comrades.klug-vigil-armsup_midProfessor Turnbolt distributed flyers and hung posters across southern California’s largest campus, encouraging students to abandon preconceived hatred and instead adopt tolerance and understanding under the banner of cultural diversity.  The ISIS vigil was so successful it even attracted supporters from other California schools.  The UCLA campus community filled Bruin Plaza to share messages of solidarity and healing in a candlelight ceremony honoring the memory of professor William Klug, who was shot and killed in his office a day earlier.Students and members of the public listened to speakers and circled a growing memorial of flowers and hand-written messages placed at the Bruin statue. The crowd thronged into the plaza shortly after sunset and lined the second and third-floor walkways of the Wooden Center. The “Bruin Strong” vigil was organized by the Undergraduate Students Association Council and the Graduate Student Association. Professor Klug was a beloved member of the mechanical and aerospace engineering faculty.“Let us illuminate the night with the unity and strength and perseverance of our Bruin family,” said Danny Siegel, student body president and third year political science major. “This is not an event we will quickly get over. It will take time to heal the sadness that has cloaked our campus, but we will heal it together. Let there always be light.”The evening’s messages were of gratitude and commendation for the first responders, and love and solidarity as the campus grieves and come to grips with the murder of a popular and promising young professor. Klug is survived by his wife and two children aged seven and nine.  	0
453	WASHINGTON  —   In President Trump’s world, boring is disruptive. After   weeks of gleefully setting the Washington establishment ablaze and declaring a new war with virtually every public utterance, Mr. Trump took the radical step on Tuesday night of delivering a soothing comfort food of an address to a jittery Congress and skeptical public. For the first time since his   in January, Mr. Trump seemed to accept the fetters of formality and tradition that define and dignify the presidency. And while he touched on all of the   elements of the economic nationalist agenda that has impelled his executive orders and calls for “revolution,” Mr. Trump brandished a blunter rhetorical ax and, for once, delivered on his promise to speak the Reagan Republican dialect of optimism and reconciliation. Why the sudden shift? Numbers. Mr. Trump’s approval rating is the worst for any new president in recorded history  —   between 38 and 50 percent at a time when many presidents are in the 60s. Slamming the news media or   demonstrators energizes his base, but it’s hard to move much higher in the polls without making a less partisan pitch. The other key statistic spurring his    adjustment: $54 billion, the amount of federal funding he hopes to siphon from other departments to increase spending at the Pentagon  —   a budget proposal that is already   on arrival, judging from its lukewarm reception on Capitol Hill this week. Presidents, even those commanding comfortable majorities in both houses, need to get Congress in line, and the only way to do that is to declare peace. Here are five takeaways from the most presidential speech Mr. Trump has ever given  —   delivered at precisely the moment he needed to project sobriety, seriousness of purpose and  . The   between Tuesday’s temperate Mr. Trump and the everyday Mr. Trump was striking, to put it mildly. “The time for trivial fights is over,” said Mr. Trump, a man who spent the first 48 hours of his presidency bickering about the size of the inauguration crowd. While that statement was meant as a challenge to his establishment critics, it also seemed as if he were coaching himself. All of the previous   speeches delivered by Mr. Trump, from his nomination address in Cleveland last summer to his   inaugural speech, had a gloomy,    quality. His aides promised a Ronald   invocation of America’s future in the days leading up to his  . What he delivered, thanks to his speechwriting team of Stephen Miller and Stephen K. Bannon, was an invocation of “American carnage. ” Since his   Mr. Trump roved the airwaves and Twitter, lashing out at anyone who opposed him, and many people who didn’t. In just the past couple of weeks, the president has reiterated his description of some news outlets as “enemies of the American people,” while taking his shots at Paris, Sweden, Hill Democrats, the F. B. I. government leakers, President Barack Obama and his own communications staff, among other targets. But on Tuesday, the president rolled the dice, and went for nice. In style, if not substance, Mr. Trump delivered an address that nearly any of his Republican primary opponents  —   whom he once savaged as establishment stooges  —   might have delivered had they been standing at the rostrum. “That torch is now in our hands,” Mr. Trump said within the first few minutes of his speech, echoing, if not entirely approaching, the wispy mountaintop oratory of more polished predecessors like Mr. Obama and Mr. Reagan. “And we will use it to light up the world. I am here tonight to deliver a message of unity and strength, and it is a message deeply delivered from my heart. ” Mr. Trump has made immense progress sticking to a script, but Wednesday is a new day, and the presidential Twitter finger gets itchy in the middle of the week. The big question is whether his unifying tone represents the mythical,   pivot point  —   or was just part of a   speech efficiently delivered by a gifted politician learning his new trade. Mr. Trump has been criticized for his sluggish response to violence and vandalism against Jews, blacks and Muslims during his presidency. But the opening words of his speech were dedicated to tolerance and inclusion. “Recent threats targeting Jewish community centers and vandalism of Jewish cemeteries, as well as last week’s shooting in Kansas City,” he said, “remind us that while we may be a nation divided on policies, we are a country that stands united in condemning hate and evil in all of its very ugly forms. ” Again, it’s hard to say if his statement reflected a genuine change of approach. Mr. Trump and some allies have suggested that recent   episodes might be   attempts by his opponents to embarrass him. But his words were welcomed in the House chamber, greeted by some of the most sustained applause of the evening. The polls have not been especially kind to Mr. Trump lately, but there is one distinct bright spot: 56 percent of voters in a   Consult poll released on Tuesday said that Mr. Trump was following through on his campaign promises. This is no small matter for a president eager to prove he’s no mere talker. For all its messaging, personnel and operational struggles, Mr. Trump’s team has relentlessly executed a branding strategy aimed at projecting the image of a man of action fighting against gridlocked and corrupt Washington elites. Every day, Mr. Trump appears before the cameras where he is shown doing stuff like signing executive orders or convening panels of business, labor or political leaders. “It’s been a little over a month since my inauguration, and I want to take this moment to update the nation on the progress I’ve made in keeping those promises,” he said, taking an extended bow for saving jobs at several factories across the country, renegotiating defense contracts, scrapping the   Partnership, greenlighting two new fuel pipelines and cracking down on illegal immigration and criminal foreigners. Never mind that Mr. Obama, the man Mr. Trump says left him “a mess” to clean up, had accomplished much more at this point in his term  —   including the stimulus package and a gender   law. For all his newfound civility and message discipline, Mr. Trump cares most about this takeaway  —   proving he is an effective president at a time when his administration is being portrayed in the media as   adrift and  . The president’s speech had admirable length (it clocked in at just over 60 minutes) the requisite number of ovations, about 90, and a succession of punchy pronouncements. What it didn’t have was very much of an explanation on how Mr. Trump plans to govern. There were hardly any details about his proposals on the   items that will most likely define his first term. That included his Obamacare    pledge, his plan to overhaul the tax code, the big infrastructure package he’s vowed to ram through, or even his plan to shovel $54 billion into the Defense Department. Cracking down on illegal immigration is the central pillar of Mr. Trump’s   popularity with white   voters, so much so that it was the subject of his most decisive action thus far as president: the bungled rollout of his executive order barring migrants from seven predominantly Muslim nations. But Mr. Trump and his team sent out some seriously mixed messages in the hours leading up to the address. “We will soon begin the construction of a great, great wall along our southern border,” Mr. Trump declared, to the delight of many Republicans in the hall, who gave him a hearty standing ovation. But earlier, in a   with some of the country’s leading news anchors, the president seemed to soften his stance considerably, as he has done previously in private, suggesting that legal status be granted to millions of undocumented immigrants who have not committed serious crimes. Immigration   led by his attorney general, Jeff Sessions, have long considered such a stance “amnesty. ” Mr. Trump never brought up the topic again  —   and didn’t touch on his prior reference to legalizing undocumented immigrants  —   raising questions about what position he’ll stake out in negotiations with Congress.	1

41	The scenery may have shrunk, but that face  —   oh, that face  —   looms larger than ever. So does the ego that animates it, both indomitable and irreparably broken. “With one look,” indeed, to borrow a song lyric that describes such unsettling presence. That outrageous,    desperate old lady shedding sanity on the stage of the Palace Theater still has the poetry in her gaze to break every heart. Yes, Hollywood’s most fatally narcissistic glamour girl, Norma Desmond, is back in town, in the   revival of Andrew Lloyd Webber’s “Sunset Boulevard” that opened on Thursday night. It is a show that exists almost entirely to let its star blaze to her heart’s content. The light she casts is so dazzling, this seems an entirely sufficient reason to be. Miss Desmond is embodied by Glenn Close, the   movie actress who won a Tony in the same part 22 years ago. And what was one of the great stage performances of the 20th century has been reinvented, in terms both larger and more intimate, that may well guarantee its status as one of the great stage performances of this century, too. Ms. Close is even better than when I first saw her  —   more fragile and more frightening, more seriously comic and tragic. Part of this presumably involves the insights an artist accumulates over the decades. It is also to Ms. Close’s advantage that she is no longer required to compete with an elephantine,   set. For this latest incarnation of “Sunset Boulevard,” directed by Lonny Price and first seen in London last year, is a close cousin to the   productions from Encores! of vintage musicals in concert at City Center. As in such presentations, the orchestra (40 pieces strong) is onstage and visible. James Noone’s set, anchored by tiered industrial scaffolding, conjures 1950s Hollywood through suggestive visual accents  —   a giant chandelier here, a floating corpse there  —   rather than   scenery. Yes, a car still shows up onstage. And our Miss Desmond still gets a workout walking up and down the stairs. But the   opulence of John Napier’s original designs has been scrubbed away. Such relative minimalism allows us to see Norma and “Sunset Boulevard” plain. The good news is that Norma has never looked bigger. (And no, I’m not forgetting about Gloria Swanson, who immortally created the part in the 1950 Billy Wilder film on which this show is based.) The musical, on the other hand, seems and sounds thin, despite the velveteen lushness of its excellent orchestra. Don Black and Christopher Hampton’s book is just fine when it hews to the   dialogue of the original screenplay. But “Sunset,” being a musical, spends most of its time singing, and Mr. Black and Mr. Hampton’s lyrics have a way of turning   cynicism into taunting schoolyard jingles, with rhymes that land as emphatically as children on hopscotch squares. (“You know I’m right.  It’s there in black and white. ”) Mr. Lloyd Webber’s music often inhabits a similar zone of singsong insistence, with certain melody lines repeated so often you fear surgery may be necessary to have them removed from your memory. Only the swirling, ominous overtures evoke the shades of noir of Franz Waxman’s original film score. For long stretches, you may even forget you’re inhabiting one of the darkest visions that Hollywood ever summoned of itself. This is a story, after all, that begins with a talking dead man. That’s Joe Gillis, the    screenwriter who narrates in sustained flashback. On the lam from a collection agency, Joe (Michael Xavier) winds up in a scary old mansion at 10086 Sunset Boulevard, playing editor, house pet and eventually lover to the reclusive Miss Desmond, a nearly forgotten   diva, who is planning her comeback. We also spend far too much time with Joe in the less exotic world of Hollywood hopefuls, where he falls for an ambitious studio worker, Betty Schaeffer (Siobhan Dillon) his best friend’s girl. Betty, to put it bluntly, is a bore, and so is Joe when he’s with her, since she has the effect of making them both sing like sweethearts out of Victor Herbert. Mr. Xavier is glib, handsome and charmingly  . But he’s lightweight, lacking the tortured conscience that William Holden brought to Wilder’s movie. Fred Johanson, looking like Lurch from “The Addams Family,” finds more substance and shadow as Max, Norma’s fanatically loyal  . The large ensemble, choreographed into flailing friskiness by Stephen Mears, is serviceable. But we’re just marking time until Norma’s back. Whenever she makes an entrance, the adrenaline that surges through the house is palpable. Swathed in   ensembles of sequined black, shimmering gold and assorted animal prints (the great Anthony Powell did Ms. Close’s costumes) her face as white and exaggeratedly expressive as Marcel Marceau’s, Norma should by rights be merely a drag queen’s fantasy. And, yes, on one level, the lady is a camp. But Ms. Close deploys the declarative physical vocabulary of   acting to convey a genuine grandeur of spirit and an equally outsize force of will. Watch Norma watching herself onscreen in a state of mimetic rapture, or seesawing violently between little girl coquettishness and iron imperiousness with her captive lover. The audacity of this performance is matched by its veracity. This is   acting of a singularly sophisticated and disciplined order, one of those rare instances in which more is truly more. Her singing voice is reedy and at times  . But her delivery, her stance, her very presence are operatic in the richest sense of the word. I won’t even try to describe the brilliant spiderlike dance  —   superhuman and pathetically human  —   with which Ms. Close concludes the show. You have to (and I mean have to) see it in person. Her interpretation of the show’s one great song, “As If We Never Said Goodbye,” in which Norma visits her old studio lot, is a  . Watching it from its beginning (when a set worker trains a spotlight on Norma’s face) to its end (when she steps to the edge of the stage to absorb the applause like an unquenchable sponge) is to understand with all your senses the addictiveness of stardom. “Feel the magic in the making,” sings Norma. You can only nod your head in   agreement.	1
692	 According to Waupun Correctional Facility representatives, Avery was found unresponsive in his prison cell at approximately 4:30 AM during his cell block’s daily wake-up call. Correctional officers attempted to communicate with Avery, however according to one of the on-scene officers, “He (Avery) just wouldn’t respond, it was pretty obvious to all that were on-scene that the lights were off and nobody was home”. The news is disheartening to Avery’s thousands of new-found supporters on the tail of the recent 10 episode Netflix documentary series Making a Murderer. Many supporters that are hopeful Avery would live to see the outside of the Waupun Correctional Facility have taken to social media with an out-pour of support for the Avery family.	0
318	“Look at that,” came the voice of our boat’s captain over a crackly intercom. “A wildlife sighting and we haven’t even left the harbor!” Toward the bow of the ship on the starboard side, a sleek, dark gray figure was cresting out of the water about 25 yards in front of us. It was a bottlenose dolphin, the playful and charismatic mammal found in oceans all over the world. I pulled out my rented binoculars to get a closer look, and a couple of fellow passengers clapped their hands in delight. We got another glimpse of the dolphin’s dorsal side and blowhole before it vanished with a quick flick of the tail. Nearby, a group of sea lions lazed on a buoy. I had been looking for an easy, casual day trip from Los Angeles, where I live, and I found it. Channel Islands National Park comprises five islands: an archipelago of four islands that hug the Santa Barbara Channel off the coast of Southern California, and the more remote Santa Barbara Island, further off toward Catalina to the southeast. The islands are remarkably close to the mainland  —   the closest is just 11 miles from shore  —   but seem like they’re a world away. During my visit to Santa Cruz Island, I felt connected to both land and sea. The breathtaking vistas, great hiking and dozens of flora and fauna unique to the islands made it clear why some refer to the Channel Islands as “the Galápagos Islands of North America. ” And unlike a pricey trip to the Galápagos Islands, I was able to explore Santa Cruz on a modest budget. Our      boat was chartered by Island Packers Cruises, the official concessionaire of the Channel Islands. The price, $29. 50 each way (I bought my ticket online) is reasonable considering there is no official entrance fee to the park. Tickets can be bought to all five islands in the park, depending on the season. Currently, tickets are only available to Anacapa and Santa Cruz, the largest of the islands. Buying ahead is recommended, and make sure to call the morning of to verify your boat is sailing sometimes there are cancellations because of the weather. You will need to bring supplies, as there is nothing available to buy on the island. (There is also no publicly usable electricity or transportation, and the cellphone service is spotty to nonexistent.) As I was only planning to be there for the day (camping overnight is also an option) I just needed food and water for a   trip. I would then follow the old scouting mantra of “pack it in, pack it out”  —   taking all my waste with me back to the mainland. After exiting the freeway in Ventura, I headed to the Royal Bakery and Cafe and bought a couple of items: a   scone ($2) and a much better croissant with turkey and cheese ($3. 95). Things like water ($1. 75 for one liter) and granola bars ($2. 50) are available at the office where the boat departs, and there is a variety of snacks on the boat, including popcorn ($3) and domestic beer ($4). You may also want to invest in some Dramamine (I didn’t see it for sale in the boat’s concession stand). Depending on the day, and how the winds are behaving, you could be in for a choppy ride. Ours was bad. “Sometimes it’s a mirror,” said Larry Driscoll, a volunteer with the Channel Islands Naturalist Corps, “and sometimes it’s even rougher than this. ” A couple of passengers had begun to turn a shade of green and quickly made their way to back of the boat. After 30 minutes of joyfully surfing the big swells at front of our craft, I joined them. Advice for the seasick: Go outside, on as low a deck as possible, and toward the rear of ship. It won’t make the nausea go away, but it will minimize your movement and the fresh air will help. Fortunately, rough seas aside, there was a lot to enjoy on the ride, which is very much a part of the entire experience, lasting over an hour each way. The highlight was when a pod of common dolphins began swimming next to our boat. Dozens of silvery fins, shimmering in the sun against a backdrop of deep blue water, cantered and crested as our captain slowed the boat. “Oh, they’re just playing now,” a woman next to me said as two of the creatures popped out of the water no more than 15 feet from us. Whales are also a common sight during voyages out to the islands  —   there are specific   tours  —   but unfortunately none appeared during our trip. After something of a rough arrival  —   thanks to the choppy waters, we had to dock at Prisoners Harbor, near the middle of the island, rather than our planned berth on its eastern side  —   we made it to Santa Cruz Island. (The island was named in the early 17th century it had been home to the Chumash tribe, before diseases from European settlers ravaged the population.) A few passengers set out on the 3.  hike to the campground and a couple others went off to hike on their own. The rest of us were given a choice of taking an “easy” hike up the Del Norte trail or a more difficult one toward Pelican Bay. I opted for the latter, joining a group with two of the Island Packers guides. The moderately difficult hike, which consists of some steep, rocky sections, is doable even for beginners. You will get your hands dirty, though, as some of the more arduous parts are closer to climbing than hiking, and require three points of contact. Leanne Kleinsmith, one of our guides and a native of Ventura County, was amazed by the effect the recent rain had had on the island. “It is so green right now,” she said. “It’s never this green. ” She was right. As we hiked along the coastal bluffs, the pine, oak and ironwood trees were remarkably lush, nothing like the yellows, browns and ochres that typically characterize Southern California. The hike to Pelican Bay goes into territory owned by the Nature Conservancy, which is based in Arlington, Va. The environmental organization owns most of the Santa Cruz Island, which was once the largest   island in the country, and the National Park Service manages the rest. Ms. Kleinsmith told me that what makes Santa Cruz Island so special, in her opinion, is its biodiversity. There are nearly a 1, 000 plant and animal species packed into less than a 100 square miles many animals are found exclusively, or nearly exclusively, on the Channel Islands, including the island spotted skunk, the island fence lizard, and the Townsend’s   bat. While lounging near the beach waiting for our return ferry back to the mainland, some of us saw an island fox, which is the only carnivore unique to California and is found only on the Channel Islands. The island fox, once at risk of extinction, now happily sidles up alongside tourists, as it has no natural predators on the island. I also got to see a couple of bald eagles soaring high above (using those rented binoculars, available for $6 at the harbor) as well as an island   a small bird with deep cobalt blue plumage that is found nowhere else in the world but Santa Cruz Island. Because of our late arrival at Prisoners Harbor, we weren’t able to complete the entire hike to Pelican Bay. What we managed, though, was well worth it: a challenging but doable path that offered beautiful views of the coastline and Pacific as well as opportunities to see wildlife. After we made it back to our starting point, there was still quite a bit of time before our ferry was to arrive. So I started the “easy” hike up the Del Norte trail: It looked alarmingly steep. After a   of walking directly uphill, I was getting winded. After another   I decided to turn back. The   easy hike was twice as difficult as the one to Pelican Bay. After an uneventful (and much less nauseating) ride back to shore, I was still feeling up for another quick adventure before heading home. Ojai, about 30 minutes from Ventura, was once a dusty ranch town but has become something of a New Age   for Los Angeles’s   . A drive down the main arcade on Ojai Avenue is worth it, but I ended up in a more modest section of town on El Roblar Drive looking for dinner. I found it at La Fuente Mexican restaurant, where I ordered an enormous pambazo sandwich: a white roll slathered in red pepper sauce and stuffed with chorizo and potatoes ($6). On the drive back to Los Angeles, I thought of the gorgeous sunset I’d just seen over Surfer’s Knoll, a small beach near the ferry dock in Ventura the spicy, filling sandwich I’d just had and, of course, the great day of hiking in one of the country’s most singular national parks. Even the traffic to Los Angeles was almost nonexistent. I couldn’t have wished for a better ending.	1
717	 The Department of Defense announced today that it has purchased five million Powerball tickets at a cost of $2 per ticket, with an aim of providing a funding windfall to the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program.“This is a minor fiscal gamble, but the Pentagon is always willing to lay out a few extra bucks in order to ensure we continue to have the most advanced military in the world,” said Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter, flashing a giddy smile. “Daddy needs a new pair of shoes, and a dozen new F-35s for the Navy’s Pacific Fleet.” A reporter brought to Carter’s attention that the jackpot only totals $1.5 billion dollar jackpot if the Pentagon elects to take the annuity paid out over 29 years, and the alternative lump sum payment would amount to less than $900 million.“Well, shit,” said Carter. “There’s no sense in taking a 29-year annuity when the F-35 will be obsolete by that time and on the auction block to Iran and Saudi Arabia. But the lump sum payment would still buy three or four F-35s today, I believe.”The reporter then pointed out the IRS would take almost half of the lump sum payout, leaving the Pentagon with around $500 million. They also noted the Navy’s F-35C variant costs $337 million per unit, leaving the Pentagon able to buy less than two F-35s for the Navy.“I don’t understand why you guys would even question this,” said a visibly frustrated Carter. “That would still be two more F-35s than we had previously, with a capital expenditure of only ten million dollars in Powerball tickets. That’s a steal.” Since 1797, Duffel Blog has been serving the men and women of the American military with insightful commentary and hard-hitting journalism.

260	CAIRO  —   In Morocco, it would tip a delicate political balance. In Jordan, it could prevent American diplomats from meeting with opposition leaders. In Tunisia, it could make criminals of a political party seen as a model of democracy after the Arab Spring. Of all the initiatives of the Trump administration that have set the Arab world on edge, none has as much potential to disrupt the internal politics of American partners in the region as the proposal to criminalize the Muslim Brotherhood, the   Islamist movement with millions of followers. “The impact would be great,” said Issandr El Amrani, an analyst with the International Crisis Group based in Morocco, where a   party won the last election in October. “It could destabilize countries where   forces would be encouraged to double down. It would increase polarization. ” At issue is a proposal floated by Trump aides that the    Brotherhood be designated as a foreign terrorist entity. The scope of any designation remains unclear, but its potential reach is vast: Founded in Egypt, the Brotherhood has evolved into a loose network that spans about two dozen countries. It has officially forsworn violence. For President Trump, the designation debate is an election promise made good. He has made no bones about taking an approach to the Middle East that is narrowly focused on counterterrorism, and that plays to domestic supporters who view all Islamist movements  —   or even all Muslims  —   as potentially hostile. In much of the Middle East, though, the rapid pace and embattled rollouts of Mr. Trump’s early orders have induced anxiety. Now many are following the potential indictment of the Muslim Brotherhood as a harbinger of things to come. “The Obama administration moved us away from the ‘clash of civilizations’ narrative,” said Emad Shahin, a dissident Egyptian academic who lectures at Georgetown University. “Trump is taking us deeper into it. ” Not all are unhappy about the move to list the Brotherhood. One leader the designation would surely delight is President Abdel Fattah   of Egypt, the former general who has led a harsh crackdown on the Brotherhood since the military ousted a Brotherhood leader, Mohamed Morsi, as president in 2013. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates also would support it. But in countries where   parties are prominent in Parliament or are in power, experts say a sweeping indictment could have serious implications for domestic politics, American diplomacy and the broader fight against Islamist extremism. In Jordan, a crucial ally in the fight against jihadist groups, Islamists constitute a small but significant bloc in the Parliament. Tunisia’s Ennahda party, which has won wide praise for its democratic engagement and moderate stance since 2011, might be shunned. The prime minister of Morocco, technically, could be considered a criminal. “You would throw many babies out with the bath water,” said Gerald M. Feierstein, a former United States ambassador to Yemen, now at the Middle East Institute in Washington. The initial momentum toward such a designation appears to have slowed. A leaked assessment by the Central Intelligence Agency said isolating the Brotherhood would serve only to empower jihadist groups some experts doubt that a broad designation would pass legal muster. But the very fact that the ban is under consideration by Mr. Trump’s aides is being taken as an ominous sign in a region where religion and politics are carefully, and often precariously, balanced. The proposed designation has also reaffirmed Mr. Trump’s apparent embrace of Mr. Sisi, who has weathered a barrage of international criticism for his country’s dismal human rights record in recent years. Mr. Trump has hailed him as a “fantastic guy” with whom he shares “good chemistry. ” Since an initial meeting at the United Nations in September, the two leaders have spoken several times by phone  —   Mr. Sisi was the first foreign leader to congratulate Mr. Trump on his victory in November  —   and now a visit to Washington by Mr. Sisi is under preparation. Egypt wants the United States to resume a military financing program, frozen by President Barack Obama in 2015, that helps it make billions of dollars in purchases of   weapons like   warplanes and M1A1 Abrams tanks. More than anything, though, a handshake in the White House for Mr. Sisi would offer a stamp of legitimacy to a leader who had been kept at arm’s length by Mr. Obama. Tens of thousands of Mr. Sisi’s opponents languish in Egyptian prisons, human rights workers are routinely harassed, and his security forces have faced accusations of extrajudicial killings. To some, it suggests Mr. Trump is set to take an approach in the Middle East that will not just tolerate strongmen and monarchs but also actively seek to embrace them  —   a throwback that evokes American alignment with autocrats like the shah of Iran in decades past. “It’s easy to say you will stand by your friends,” said Mr. Feierstein at the Middle East Institute. “But authoritarian regimes are always brittle, always fragile. We thought we would stand by the shah of Iran until the day he got on an airplane and left the country. Now what do we have to show for it? We have 40 years of not being able to have a relationship with Iran. ” Brotherhood officials insist that the Trump administration has gotten it wrong. In a letter smuggled from the   Egyptian prison where he is being held, the Brotherhood spokesman Gehad   admitted that his party had made serious mistakes during its yearlong stint in power in Egypt from 2012 to 2013. Citing the “  lessons of the Arab Spring,” he said the Brotherhood had failed to heed loud opposition from millions of Egyptians who disliked Mr. Morsi’s actions. But, he insisted, the movement renounced bloodshed. “Our flaws are many,” he wrote. “Violence is not one. ” In other places, the reality can be harder to pin down. By nature secretive, the Brotherhood takes different forms around the world. In some places, its members have condoned or committed violent acts. Its Palestinian offshoot, Hamas, carries out suicide bombings in Egypt, angry young supporters have been accused of attacking Mr. Sisi’s security forces. But that does not make terrorists of the many millions of people who support the Brotherhood’s political ideology across many countries. One route for the Trump administration could be to narrowly designate specific Brotherhood branches as terrorists, said Mokhtar Awad, an expert on the group. But it would be better still, he argued, to “engage in a battle of ideas. ” The debate could prove an early lesson for the administration in doing business in the Middle East, which has long resisted   prescriptions. Unpalatable as its ideas may be to Trump officials, the Brotherhood may become just one of many factors they will be forced to grapple with. “We engage with the Brotherhood knowing they are problematic actors, but they are also a reality,” said Michael Wahid Hanna of the Century Foundation. “And the alternative  —   ignoring or repressing them  —   leads to a very bad place. ”	1
426	WASHINGTON  —    A ruling issued on Monday by a federal judge in Manhattan, in a case brought by a freelance journalist without a lawyer, may interest the White House. The judge said that the New York Police Department may have violated the First Amendment by revoking the press credentials of the journalist, Jason B. Nicholas. The ruling was preliminary, and the Police Department said it had legitimate reasons for its actions. But Judge J. Paul Oetken’s decision was timely, following as it did the exclusion of several news organizations from a Friday briefing at the White House. “It has been held impermissible,” Judge Oetken wrote, “to exclude a single television news network from live coverage of mayoral candidates’ headquarters and to withhold White House press passes in a   or arbitrary fashion. ” Last Friday’s developments at the White House crossed that legal line, said Jameel Jaffer, the director of the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University. “That was unconstitutional,” he said. “If you exclude reporters from briefings that they otherwise have a right to attend because you don’t like their reporting, then you have engaged in viewpoint discrimination. ” Viewpoint discrimination by the government in a public forum is almost always unconstitutional. Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, on Friday barred journalists from The New York Times, BuzzFeed News, CNN, The Los Angeles Times, Politico, the BBC and The Huffington Post from a daily briefing. Aides to Mr. Spicer admitted only reporters from a group of news organizations that, the White House said, had been previously confirmed. After the session, Mr. Spicer’s deputy said all White House journalists were represented by the small, rotating press pool that covers the president’s daily movements and shares its reporting with the rest of the press corps, and that Mr. Spicer had merely opted to add a few other organizations to that group. Repeated attempts by The Times to be included in the group of confirmed attendees were unsuccessful. An email to an official in the White House press office inquiring about whether a Times reporter would be allowed in and requesting access was not answered. A Times reporter who went to the White House briefing room to try to gain access was turned away and told he could not be included. The White House’s rationale for allocating seats at the briefing, if accurate, would probably pose no First Amendment issues. But there are reasons to think the White House singled out news organizations whose work it dislikes. “We’re going to aggressively push back,” Mr. Spicer said, according to a recording of the session provided by a reporter who was allowed to attend. “We’re just not going to sit back and let, you know, false narratives, false stories, inaccurate facts get out there. ” Public officials are not required to give reporters perfectly equal access, of course, and exclusive interviews and selective leaks are commonplace and lawful. But First Amendment experts said the allocation of government resources like press passes and access to public forums like news conferences must be based on neutral criteria rather than discrimination based on what the journalists had written. Lots of interactions between the government and the news media do not implicate those kinds of First Amendment concerns. In 2006, for instance, a federal appeals court ruled that Gov. Robert L. Ehrlich Jr. of Maryland did not violate the First Amendment rights of two Baltimore Sun reporters by prohibiting state employees from talking to them because he was unhappy with their reporting. “It is common knowledge,” Judge Paul V. Niemeyer wrote for a unanimous   panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, in Richmond, Va. “that reporting is highly competitive, and reporters cultivate access  —   sometimes exclusive access  —   to sources, including government officials. Public officials routinely select among reporters when granting interviews or providing access to nonpublic information. ” But press credentials and seats at government news conferences are a different matter, according to a 1977 decision from the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. “White House press facilities having been made publicly available as a source of information for newsmen, the protection afforded news gathering under the First Amendment guarantee of freedom of the press, requires that this access not be denied arbitrarily or for less than compelling reasons,” Judge Carl E. McGowan wrote for a unanimous   panel. “Not only newsmen and the publications for which they write, but also the public at large have an interest protected by the First Amendment in assuring that restrictions on news gathering be no more arduous than necessary, and that individual newsmen not be arbitrarily excluded from sources of information. ” Scott Gant, a lawyer with Boies Schiller  Flexner and the author of “We’re All Journalists Now: The Transformation of the Press and Reshaping of the Law in the Internet Age,” said Friday’s developments were troubling. “The exclusion of certain news organizations from press briefings, if motivated by disagreement or displeasure with their coverage of the administration, may well have crossed an important constitutional line  —   potentially constituting violations of the First Amendment,” he said. First Amendment experts said the decision to bar reporters from Friday’s briefing was of a piece with the Trump administration’s hostility to much of the news media. “Unhappiness with and criticism of the press by American presidents has been the norm, not the exception,” said Floyd Abrams, a leading First Amendment lawyer. “But daily denigration of the press as the enemy of the American people and statements that the use of confidential sources by journalists ‘shouldn’t be allowed’ is both novel and dangerous. ” But Michael W. McConnell, a law professor at Stanford, said news organizations can be too   and too quick to invoke the First Amendment. “Criticism of the press is not an attack on freedom of the press, any more than criticism of the president is an attack on the presidency,” he said. “In my opinion, the press should respond to President Trump’s criticism not by taking umbrage at the criticism but by doing the best, most professional job it can do, including covering Trump fairly and accurately. ” Ilya Somin, a law professor at George Mason University, said Mr. Trump may have violated important norms even if he crossed no legal line. “A president has every right to criticize the media, and almost all presidents do on occasion,” he said. “It is also legitimate to point out that there is liberal bias in many outlets. But Trump’s comments go well beyond that and often verge on trying to delegitimize the media as an institution. That’s a bad thing. ” Mr. Spicer’s actions on Friday may turn out to be a blip. Or they may be the first step toward the sort of constitutionally forbidden discrimination that worries many First Amendment experts. Mr. Nicholas, the journalist who sued the police department, said he saw a connection between his case and what happened at the White House. “When President Trump excluded certain media outlets from an otherwise open press event,” he said, “then the White House engaged in precisely the kind of   discrimination that is unconstitutional under the court’s decision in my case. ” “When government authorities get to pick and choose who among the press gets to cover an event,” Mr. Nicholas said, “everyone loses, the public first and foremost. ”	1

153	RIO DE JANEIRO  —   It is not uncommon for the Olympics to leave behind some unneeded facilities. Rio, however, is experiencing something exceptional: Less than six months after the Summer Games ended, the host city’s Olympic legacy is decaying rapidly. Empty Olympic buildings abound, puncturing any uplifting buzz from the competitions last summer. At the Olympic Park, some stadium entrances are boarded up, and screws are scattered on the ground. The handball arena is barricaded with metal bars. The broadcast center remains half disassembled. The   pool is decorated with piles of dirt and puddles. Deodoro, a neighborhood in Rio’s poor periphery, has the   cluster of Olympic sites. The canoe slalom course was to be converted into a giant public swimming pool. It closed to the public in December. Today, residents fill plastic pools a few hundred feet away. “The government put sugar in our mouths and took it out before we could swallow,” Luciana Oliveira Pimentel, a social worker from Deodoro, said as her children played in a plastic pool. “Once the Olympics ended, they turned their backs on us. ” Olympic officials and local organizers often boast about the legacy of the Games  —   the residual benefits that a city and country will experience long after the competitions end. Those projections are often met with skepticism by the public and by independent economists, who argue that Olympic bids are built on wasted public money. Rio has quickly become the latest, and perhaps the most striking, case of unfulfilled promises and abandonment. “It’s totally deserted,” said Vera Hickmann, 42, who was at the Olympic Park recently with her family. She lamented that although the area was open to the public, it lacked basic services. “I had to bring my son over to the plants to go to the bathroom,” she said. At the athletes’ village, across the street from the park, the 31 towers were supposed to be sold as luxury condominiums after the Games, but fewer than 10 percent of the units have been sold. Across town at Maracanã Stadium, a soccer temple, the field is brown, and the electricity has been shut off. “The government didn’t have money to throw a party like that, and we’re the ones who have to sacrifice,” Ms. Hickmann said, referring to local taxpayers. In the preparations for the Games, the city of Rio promised “no white elephants” and outlined plans for facilities to be turned into public sporting areas and schools. The arena that hosted taekwondo and fencing was to be transformed into a school. Two other arenas were to be taken apart, and one put back together as four schools in another area. None of that has happened. The mayor’s office said those plans were still in the works, but it did not offer a specific timetable. The decay of Olympic sites is happening as a financial crisis engulfs federal, state and municipal governments. “The nation is in crisis, Rio de Janeiro is in crisis  —   it’s time to be cautious,” Marcelo Crivella, who became mayor on Jan. 1, told incoming city council members. “Spending is prohibited,” he added. Rio’s mayor during the Games, Eduardo Paes, was among the strongest evangelizers of an Olympic legacy. He said in an email that it was too soon to call any of the sites white elephants and that “the path to implementing a legacy has been given. ” After the Games, the city held an auction for private companies to bid on administering the Olympic Park, but there were no bidders. That left the Ministry of Sport, an organ of the federal government, with the financial burden. The minister of sport, Leonardo Picciani, said in an interview that the agency’s goal was to find a private company to take over the park, but because there has been no interest, it is the government’s responsibility to maintain the sites. Mr. Picciani also said that the stadiums would not become burdensome relics, pointing to several sporting events scheduled for this year at Olympic Park, along with sports training programs. Renato Cosentino, a researcher at the Regional and Urban Planning Institute at the Federal University of Rio, who studies the Olympic Park region, said the park “was born as a white elephant,” because it was built in a   wealthy suburb that is home to only about 5 percent of Rio’s 6. 3 million residents. Having the majority of investment there, he said, proves that the Olympics were meant to serve real estate developers, who took on much of the construction for the Games in exchange for being able to build on the land afterward, in what is known as a   partnership. But even developers’ expectations have not panned out. The construction giants Carvalho Hosken and Odebrecht took on the project of building the athletes’ village in hopes of selling the accommodations as luxury condominiums after the Games, banking on the area’s becoming a desirable neighborhood for the city’s elite. In the 31   towers that make up the village, only 20 units have been sold since the beginning of the Olympics in August, bringing the total sold to 260, out of 3, 604 apartments. In a scramble to sell off the apartments before Carvalho Hosken becomes responsible for about $6. 5 million in monthly interest payments (previously paid for by the local organizing committee for the Olympics) the company is in the process of striking a deal with Rio’s city government to sell them to civil servants, such as military personnel, at discounted prices with low interest rates, according to the Brazilian newspaper O Globo. Rio’s prominent soccer stadium, the Maracanã, which hosted the opening and closing ceremonies, has also fallen into disrepair, with a brown field, several thousand seats uprooted, televisions missing and nearly $1 million owed to the electricity company. The consortium that normally administers the stadium, Maracanã S. A. claims that Rio 2016 and the Rio State government did not hold up their end of a contract that required them to maintain the stadium and return it in the state in which it was given to them. The   Deodoro neighborhood was a favorite talking point for Olympic officials before and during the Games. Several sites  —   including those for equestrian events, shooting and field hockey  —   were constructed there, heralded as a shining example of how the Olympics can lift a blighted area. The flagship, however, was the giant swimming pool, used as the canoe slalom course, which opened to the public before the Games. When the pool opened, Mr. Paes, the mayor at the time, beamed. “We’ve made an early legacy here,” he said. “I think this is something   in the history of the Olympics. ” The pool is now closed, though temperatures are regularly in the 90s and the neighborhood is a long bus ride from Rio’s beaches. The current mayor, Mr. Crivella, again said the city intended to reopen the pool as soon as possible, but he did not forecast a date. Close by, the Triângulo favela community was disrupted to make way for rapid bus lines that were expanded before the Olympics. Several homes and the community’s plaza, its main leisure space, were removed by the construction. Today, a turnaround for the buses looms over where the plaza used to be, but residents have no access to the buses. They say they were promised a bus terminal and a new leisure space, but neither has come. “The government, business people  —   they tricked us,” said Camila Felix Muguet, 36, who lost part of her home and her backyard to the project. “They came, they robbed, and they said goodbye. Now they’re gone, and where are our upgrades?” Ms. Pimentel, the Deodoro resident whose children were playing in a plastic pool, said she had always suspected that the public pool might not last. “The Olympics ended, Deodoro ended,” she said, shaking her head. “We’re going to be forgotten. ”	1
395	ATLANTA  —   It is 3 in the afternoon, and Anthony Palmer, 62, is behind the wheel of the   retrofitted and rebranded bread truck that is Anthony’s Rolling Store. Today his wares include vegetable oil, cornstarch,   oatmeal pies, ramen noodles, ice cream, Slim Jims, doughnuts, ChapStick, Dial soap, little cigars, chips, fruit punch and Saltine crackers. He has a sign declaring that he accepts food stamps. He has the program from his wife’s funeral in 2015 taped above his seat. The photograph on the cover shows Elizabeth Palmer on the edge of a   smile, as though acknowledging that life is not all drudgery and pain. Mr. Palmer pulls up in front of a Boys  Girls Club, close to where Techwood Homes, the nation’s first housing project, stood before it was demolished ahead of the 1996 Olympic Games. “Kids,” a woman cries, “the rolling store’s here!” The little ones come out in their school uniforms, twirling braids, choosing carefully from the bags of salty junk on display, hands reaching up to put their money up on the ledge of the little window by the back wheels. The teenagers are tall enough to lean into the window almost conspiratorially. They look like penitents at confession. Mr. Palmer, half obscured in the truck’s interior, calls each of them sir or ma’am. He teaches respect by respecting them first. A teenage boy asks for blunts. “No, sir,” the proprietor said. Mr. Palmer’s truck is among the last of a small and dying tradition in this section of black Atlanta, just west and northwest of downtown. In the 1970s and ’80s, there were rolling stores all over neighborhoods like English Avenue and Vine City, stocked with all of the fixings for a real supper, recalled Greg Morgan, the owner of a    convenience store in a notoriously rough area called the Bluff. “Fatback, hog maw, pig knuckles,” he said. “It was a thriving thing, and it was a moneymaking thing. ” Mr. Morgan has a number of theories as to why the rolling stores are disappearing, including   regulation from city officials and a hunch that home cooking is yet another dying tradition around here. More broadly, the disappearance of the rolling stores may simply be a result of the relentless and multifarious pace of change in Atlanta, one of those American cities that move and morph at the pace of the nation itself. It is a reality Mr. Palmer has embraced. He didn’t have much choice. But then again, who does? “When times change,” he said, “you’ve got to change with the times. ” He grew up in Herndon Homes, another public housing complex nearby, in a neighborhood that had gone from white to black by midcentury. His father was a barber, and when he died, Mr. Palmer, who had never learned to cut hair, opened his first convenience store in the old barbershop, across the street from the projects. Before that, Mr. Palmer had done menial labor on the nearby campus of Georgia Tech, earning a pittance. In his first weeks in retail, he said, “I was making almost $2, 500 a week  —   like, $1, 200 in food stamps and $1, 200 in cash. “I couldn’t believe it,” he continued. “I thought those times were going to last. ” They didn’t. He was forced to move the store to a less advantageous location. The competition grew stiff. He quit the store and opened a game room, set among the project’s apartments. Then the city bought out the game room and all of Herndon Homes in anticipation of tearing it all down. It was part of a larger project, now nearly fully realized, to replace the city’s traditional public housing. Many housing units have been replaced with communities that mix   and subsidized units, in an attempt to break up what many saw as concentrated warrens of dysfunction and poverty. In 2006, Mr. Palmer took the money the city had paid him for the game room and paid $5, 000 for the old bread truck. He bought a generator and a refrigerator, and stocked it with perishables  —   milk, eggs, bread, meat. He took the truck through Herndon Homes, before they were knocked down, and rolled daily among the new apartments  —   clean, brick, rectilinear, blandly handsome  —   where Techwood Homes used to be. It beat working behind a traditional counter, where he and his wife would have to stand from 7 a. m. to 11 p. m. every day. With the truck, he said, “I could go move around, make $200, $300 in a day, and then go lay down at home. ” In 2010, the Atlanta Housing Authority demolished Herndon Homes. Since then, the project has been a big empty lot, though there are plans to turn it into a new “urban community” with a fitness center and retail. Today, Anthony’s Rolling Store mostly moves around where the old Techwood project used to be. Some of the old families moved back to the subsidized homes. It seems that nearly everybody has his cell number. Mr. Anthony they call him. Mr. Anthony, my mother wants you to come by, they say. Mr. Anthony, do you have any   drinks? At his approach, they run down the stairs with their dollars. Derrick Butler, 42, who lives in the suburbs now, was outside one such building. His mother, who raised him in Techwood, just died. He ordered Nutty Buddies, a Big Dipper, a strawberry shortcake ice cream bar and oatmeal pies. To Mr. Butler, the rolling store is a reminder of the informal ways in the old Techwood: how somebody would be evicted and the kids would use the abandoned mattresses for wrestling matches. How his mother would go down to the community center and cook ribs, chicken and fish. It was by no means perfect, he said. “But it was family. My mother knew every drug dealer, every gang member and every police officer. ” They knew she would not abide them roping her son into trouble. Mr. Palmer drove away and said Mr. Butler’s mother was an exceptionally good woman, one of the few people he had extended credit to. A few minutes later, a young man was short $1. 25, and Mr. Palmer let it ride. “He usually pays me back,” he said. “He’s pretty good. ” The truck rolled on. These days, Mr. Palmer’s energy is waning. His generator broke, the refrigerator is out, and he no longer keeps milk and eggs. He talks, somewhat fancifully, about turning over the truck to a nephew and monitoring the business from home with an internet camera. He still grieves for his wife. She kept the books, and they loved each other. “She used to tell me all the time, ‘I don’t know what I’d do if you died first,’” he said. “I used to pay it no attention. Now that she’s gone, I know what she was talking about. ” His son, Anthony Jr. 30, is autistic, and Mr. Palmer spends most of his time looking after him. “There are a lot of stories about black men not taking care of their children,” he said. “But they don’t tell the stories about the good men taking care of their children. ” The truck does not roll as much as it used to  —   just a few hours a week. The Atlanta Falcons are building their new football stadium just down the road. It looks like a cut diamond, or like some futuristic building on Mars. Everyone is talking about neighborhood revitalization. Mr. Palmer can envision the day when the threadbare old houses like his are replaced by condos with fitness centers. It bothers him some. But sometimes he talks as though change in the city is a force too powerful to be judged, but rather something at which to marvel, like a storm. “Man, I done seen children grow up and have babies, and come back, and I don’t even know who they was,” he said. “They’ll say, ‘You know, I used to buy honey buns off your truck. ’”	1
74	House Republicans have an ambitious plan for overhauling the way American businesses are taxed. A short list of the plan’s potential benefits looks awesome: It would give companies more incentive to keep jobs in the United States, less to overextend themselves on borrowed money and provide vast savings by reducing what companies spend on tax lawyers, who help them game the current system. Yet these changes could also set off a cascade of more harmful effects. The plan could shift trillions of dollars of wealth from Americans to foreigners set off an emerging markets financial crisis wreak havoc in global oil markets and cause sustained harm to the American higher education and tourism industries (including, as it happens, luxury hotels with President Trump’s name on them). Welcome to the real world. The tax code has been flawed and inefficient for a very long time, precisely because fixing it could be so terribly disruptive. In a nutshell, the corporate tax issue provides an excellent case study of the problem of “path dependency” in public policy. The United States might well have a better, more efficient tax code today if, starting a century ago, lawmakers had designed it so that businesses were taxed on where their sales and expenses take place, as the Republicans’ plan calls for. But that is not what happened. Instead, lawmakers took what seemed to be a logical approach: They focused on taxing businesses on their profits. Today, that choice shapes arrangements in every corner of the economy. It affects the values of currencies and financial assets. Every business has devised its structure and organization to maximize its advantage within the existing system. Given all that, any fundamental change in the corporate tax code will create powerful ripples  —   some quite predictable, others less so  —   across the business and financial landscape. Essentially, for a politician trying to decide whether to support the new legislation, the question boils down to whether you think the potential   gains are big enough to justify the probable   and   disruptions. A closer look at the disruptions that moving toward a “  cash flow tax” would create makes clear why it would be no small event. The tax has a feature called “border adjustment,” under which exports are not taxed but imports are. That, at first glance, may seem to penalize companies that import goods, like retailers, and subsidize those that export, like makers of jumbo jets. But economists believe the change in the tax code would lead to shifts in the currency markets that offset those moves, namely to a sharp rise in the value of the dollar compared with other currencies. The most vigorous opponents of the plan include retailers and consumer goods companies, which worry that currency adjustments won’t fully offset the damage they will suffer (they have a newly formed group fighting it, Americans for Affordable Products). But beyond the obvious problems, the proposed change in the tax code would cascade through the economy in many other ways. A 25 percent rise in the value of the dollar, the most widely used currency on the planet, would have enormous consequences. Supporters think the dollar will rise that much if the plan is enacted  —   indeed, it must happen, to avoid sticking Americans with much higher prices for imported consumer goods. But according to calculations by Michael J. Graetz, a Columbia law professor, a currency shift of that scale implies that Americans who hold foreign assets would lose $6. 1 trillion, and foreign holders of assets in the United States would gain as much as $8. 1 trillion. Meanwhile, because the dollar is the world’s benchmark currency, many businesses and governments outside the United States borrow in it, especially in   countries where confidence in the domestic currency is low. That means that a steep   in the value of the dollar generally makes those debts more onerous, and causes big trouble for countries including China, South Korea and Turkey. Consider that the Asian financial crisis in 1998, the Latin American crisis in 2001 and an emerging markets slump in 2015 all had their roots in debt problems and a spike in the dollar. What’s more, global markets in oil and other commodities are priced in dollars, so a dollar spike could unleash    reactions from commodity producers. Oil would become much more expensive, and oil price shocks have helped set off recessions in the    past. Perhaps the most   consequence of such a tax overhaul  —   which would, presumably, be signed by President Trump  —   would be the damage to the tourism and education sectors in the United States. These businesses would have a serious problem, unlike conventional exporters  —   companies that ship things overseas, say. For the exporters, the disadvantages caused by a   in the dollar would just cancel out the advantage received from changes in the tax system. But businesses that are not exporting anything across the border would suffer from the damage of a more expensive dollar without receiving advantages from border adjustment. As Stan Veuger of the American Enterprise Institute has noted, that applies to any organization that serves a large number of foreign customers within the United States’ borders. Think of, say, a Trump international hotel, or amusement parks like Disney World, or any American university that bolsters its finances with foreign enrollment at   tuition. All of these sectors would see their prices rise because of the dollar   without any countervailing tax benefit. Lest any of these ripple effects seem like academic abstractions, keep in mind that tax changes can have powerful spillover effects. Some obscure provisions around depreciation rules in the 1986 tax reform act set off a downturn in the commercial real estate industry that, in turn, was a major factor in the 1990 recession. The problem of policy path dependency isn’t limited to the tax system, of course. The Obama administration faced it when it began to overhaul the health care system eight years ago. Many liberals argued that the United States should move toward a   system in which the government pays for all health care, called a   system. The Obama team saw that approach as appealing in theory, but too disruptive in practice so many Americans had become accustomed to receiving health insurance through their employer that it didn’t seem feasible to make a wholesale shift to a new and, perhaps, more efficient system. In other words, decisions that lawmakers made decades or even a century ago have essentially locked us into ways of doing things, as the cost of changing looms more heavily than the potential benefits of trying something different. And people who have much to fear from a change tend to be louder than those who have something to gain, a central dynamic that tilts policy in the United States toward   conservatism. All of this is frustrating for anyone who believes that the existing system, whether for corporate taxes or health care, is broken and needs radical reform. But the bigger the change, the bigger the side effects.	1
390	During another week of presidential declarations that some journalists were “enemies of the people” of new steps to restrict White House press access by way of a    list, and of reported moves to force national intelligence agencies to toe the administration line, a   pattern set in. Journalists, their subscriptions and ratings spiking, howled about another move to undercut the role the free press plays in a democracy (which “Dies in Darkness” as the new Washington Post slogan has it). The administration doubled down on its antipress aggression, this time declaring it was “going to get worse every day” for these “globalist” and “corporatist” journalists (and other such gobbledygook from the former Goldman Sachs executive Stephen K. Bannon). And all the while, so many of the most important and credible leaders in the president’s own party more or less kept their traps shut or looked the other way. If there were ever a moment for government leaders who believe that true information unearthed by independent news sources is vital to our nation to stand up and say so, this would be it. President Trump’s argument that the national press corps is illegitimate and dishonest has emerged as one of the most consistent themes of his presidency, alongside  —   and seemingly as important to him  —   his calls for a major tax code overhaul, an end to Obamacare, a border wall and “extreme vetting. ” Those other parts of his agenda appeal to large groups of Republicans on Capitol Hill, including the leaders of the House and the Senate. So you could see the appeal of staying out of the way to let Mr. Trump do his thing against the press  —   no great favorite on The Hill anyway  —   as their other big policy dishes marinate and cook. But they might be wise to rethink that strategy. The journalism that Mr. Trump and his aides seek to delegitimize today could be the legitimate research and bipartisan data points they try to use to make policy arguments with Mr. Trump tomorrow. There’s also that part of putting your money where your mouth is after spending long careers extolling the genius of the founders who created our system to ensure our president never became an infallible king, ever cognizant that, as James Madison put it, “popular government without popular information,” is “a prologue to a farce or tragedy. ” Asked on Thursday about Mr. Trump’s first declaration that the press was “the enemy,” Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, said, “I don’t view you guys as the enemy. ” It warms the heart. He went on to say: “I expect adversarial questions. And you rarely disappoint me. And I think it’s part of what make America function. ” It was a start, I guess. But it fell short of the   “knock it off” to Mr. Trump that these times demand, at least when it comes to calling true journalism false or calling journalists dishonest enemies. The office of Representative Paul D. Ryan, the House speaker, declined to engage with me on Saturday when I asked for a comment on whether Mr. Ryan was comfortable with what I called Mr. Trump’s attempt to delegitimize the fourth estate. His office said it disputed the premise of the question. As a couple of senior congressional Republican aides told me on Saturday  —   on condition of anonymity, to speak candidly about private discussions  —   there is a view on their side of the aisle that, while Mr. Trump’s bombast is notable, the press is being too quick to hyperventilate, and that, in the end, things will be just fine. And every week I wonder about it myself  —   how serious are all the threats and bluster against the news media by Mr. Trump and Mr. Bannon, given that news organizations continue to break big stories about the administration with help from leaks that have not abated despite the presidential pounding? None of it stopped The Washington Post from reporting on Friday that presidential aides, after failing to convince the F. B. I. to publicly dispute reports by The New York Times and CNN about contact between Trump campaign aides and Russian intelligence, went on to successfully pressure other intelligence officials and key congressmen to do the same. It didn’t keep The Associated Press and The Wall Street Journal from reporting on a Department of Homeland Security assessment disputing the basis for the administration’s attempt to block travel to the United States from seven predominantly Muslim countries. Nor did it stop the news team at KOKH, a Fox television station in Oklahoma City, from learning and reporting that Mr. Trump’s new leader of the Environmental Protection Agency, Scott Pruitt, conducted some state business by private email during his time as Oklahoma’s attorney general, despite denying that he did so in recent Senate testimony. On Saturday, I turned to a sage of the Washington press corps, Bob Schieffer of CBS, whose time in Washington dates to the Nixon administration, to see how seriously he took the recent threats against the press. It was his 80th birthday. “We need to be taking this very seriously  —   any time you undermine the press, I think that’s very dangerous for democracy,” Mr. Schieffer said. “Do we want a situation where the only source of information is the government? I mean, really? Somehow I don’t think that’s what the founders intended. ” Mr. Schieffer was struck by Mr. Trump’s declaration on Friday that the press should not rely on anonymous government sources when his administration had pushed officials to speak anonymously to reporters that very same day. Mr. Trump was quite fond of anonymous sources himself when, for instance, he promoted the lie that President Barack Obama wasn’t born in the United States by announcing “an extremely credible source” had told him Mr. Obama’s “birth certificate is a fraud. ” All of which leaves the question of what’s to be done about it. The most obvious answer came in the statement CNN made after the network  —   along with The New York Times, BuzzFeed, Politico and The Los Angeles Times  —   was cut out of an   press briefing with Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, on Friday: “We’ll keep reporting regardless,” the network declared. There should be, however, legitimate questions about whether that reporting should include blanket coverage of the next speech Mr. Trump gives in which he calls honest journalists dishonest or “the opposition. ” Those kinds of polemical statements are no longer “news” (defined as “new”) but rather part of a repetitive, antipress, negative branding campaign. Another lesson came on Friday after several news organizations went along with Mr. Spicer’s exclusive gaggle, including CBS News, ABC News, Bloomberg and The Wall Street Journal, even as Time and The Associated Press refused. After Twitter vented proper umbrage  —   I was in that chorus  —   The Journal and Bloomberg said they wouldn’t “participate in exclusionary briefings of the sort that happened today” in the future, as the Bloomberg editor in chief John Micklethwait said. It was the   thing to do. Your turn, responsible leaders of America.	1

735	 According to one eye witness “As we were walking across the street, this car comes flying through the red light. She ran up on the sidewalk and smashed into a group of people walking accross the street and into the group of people at the corner. She did not slow down and appeared to accelerate as she hit the sidewalk.” According to that witness. there is a huge row of plants and bushes separating the sidewalk and the strip, but the woman driver ran through both, at a speed he guessed to be 40-45 miles per hour. “People were flying off the front of her car and people were smashing into other people as she plowed through the crowd.” The witness went on to say “As this unfolded, the only thing I recall as this happened is the insane sound of her car accelerating and the voice from the car was screaming ‘Allah Akbar!’ I’ve heard the sound enough times on the news that I was waiting for a bomb to blow up or guns to start firing.” This was an act of Islamic Terrorism, perpetrated by an Islamic woman driving a car with a three year old child inside, who INTENTIONALLY rode onto the sidewalk to strike innocent people. Police, however, have been instructed by their superiors to NOT use the word “terrorism” in relation to this incident, because Las Vegas does not want tourists to be frightened away from the city. About 30 minutes after the initial incident was reported, an adult female, later identified as 24-year old Lakeisha Holloway, went to the valet area of the Tuscany Hotel located at 255 East Flamingo Road, and asked an employee to call the police. It was believed Holloway was involved in the incident on the Strip and she was taken into custody without incident. A three-year old female was in the vehicle with Holloway who was believed to be her daughter. The child was uninjured and was turned over to Child Protective Services where they will assist in locating other family members.The investigation indicated this incident was intentional and as a result of the investigation initiated by multiple details of the LVMPD, Holloway was arrested and Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department transported to the Clark County Detention Center where she currently faces the following charges:– Murder with a Deadly Weapon– Child Abuse or Neglect (felony)– Leaving the Scene of an Accident (felony)Once the remaining victims’ statements and medical records are put together, it is anticipated that Holloway will face a multitude of other charges. Just heading to Absinthe; the show at Ceasars Palace. Was walking down the strip heading to our show; as we parked at the Paris for dinner and walked down the street to go to the show. As we were walking accross the street, this car comes flying through the red light, we had right of way and walking accross the intersection, she ran up on the sidewalk and smashed into a group of people walking accross the street and into the group of people at the corner. She did not slow down and appeared to accelerate as she hit the sidewalk. There’s a huge row of plants and bushes seperating the sidewalk and the strip, she ran through both, probably 40-45 miles per hour. People were flying off the front of her car and people were smashing into other people as she plowed through the crowd. My friend was walking ahead of us as he was making a joke of the minion characters that were lined up on the sidewalk, wanted to pose for a picture, the car hit a bush and the bush smacked into his legs; he buckled from the impact and fell down in writhing pain. He is listed as one of the 36 injured but I will not name his name. We spent the last 5 hours on the strip giving our report to police and this is the first chance I’ve had to come on here and post. I’ve been following this story HERE as I know this is the only place to get the REAL news!As this unfolded, the only thing I recall as this happened is the insane sound of her car accelerating and the voice from the car was screaming Allah Akbar! I’ve heard the sound enough times on the news and posts on here that I was waiting for a bomb to blow up or guns to start firing. My friends ducked into the Hard Rock Casino which is right by the Paris and waited to see if something else was going to happen. After 30 minutes we went back to the street with total chaos, cops and ambulances shutting everything down and a systematic closure of casinos closely. We were told to leave if able, and not to linger but more and more people gathered to see what was going on.I thought this shit wouldn’t hit Vegas but I am first hand proof that’s it’s here, in Sin City with evil Islam at its roots! This bitch was crazy and was screaming with both windows down! I didn’t notice a kid in the car but after reading the news that a toddler was in there it makes me sick!I’m coming down from an adrenaline rush like I’ve never had. I’m ex-Air Force and I wish I was active duty so I could FRY these fuckin radicals from my country! Watch yourselves people; they come out of no-where and will hit you where you least expect it!

13	SAN FRANCISCO  —   No matter which political party you belong to, one thing is clear: Donald J. Trump’s presidency has galvanized political activism to a level of passion not seen since the civil rights movement. Far less clear is what you can do in reaction to the Trump administration’s changes. And in an era that promises instant gratification  —   like cars, couriers and food summoned to your driveway with the tap of a smartphone app  —   you might think tech is a quick and easy solution to becoming a political activist. But it turns out software and web tools can go only so far. “Sitting behind your computer is not going to be as effective as showing up for people where they really need it,” said Joshua Tauberer, the creator of GovTrack, a popular web tool for tracking legislation. “Government is people. ” At best, tech is an excellent resource for staying on top of political activities. But at some point, you will have to go outside or pick up the phone and engage with people, like fellow citizens and members of Congress. That’s not to say tech is powerless. Opponents of Mr. Trump’s immigration ban, for example, used Twitter and Facebook to rally thousands of people for protests at the nation’s airports last month. Similarly, protesters used social media platforms to help coordinate the Jan. 21 women’s marches, which by one account constituted the largest day of demonstrations in American history. But what else can you do besides following news and events on Twitter and Facebook? What follows is a guide to some of the most useful resources and tools I uncovered after interviews with   activists. The first challenge to getting more politically active is filtering out the torrent of political news to understand what you should care about. One   approach is to read the executive orders posted on the White House website. Beyond that, following your members of Congress is an important way to get deeper information, says Indivisible, an activism guide published by former congressional staff members. These are the people who introduce legislation, so keeping up with them is crucial if you want to be more politically active. After identifying your members of Congress, visit their websites and sign up to receive their newsletters and invitations to local events. You can create Google News alerts on certain lawmakers to keep up with their actions. Another approach is following the legislation you care about. Mr. Tauberer’s tool, GovTrack. us, lets you share your location, select an issue and view the bills that have been introduced. For example, Senator Dianne Feinstein of California introduced a bill to nullify the effect of the executive order on immigration. The site says there is a 7 percent chance of the bill being enacted. You could then contact Ms. Feinstein’s office to say you support or oppose her bill. After becoming educated, the next step is to engage by contacting lawmakers and letting them know what you think. Political activism is surprisingly  : Phone calls carry more weight than an email or a tweet, partly because a phone ringing incessantly is harder to ignore than a flooded inbox. Less obvious is how to do all that. You have to find your local representative and then figure out what to say. Mr. Tauberer recently published a new web tool, phonecongress. com. The site detects your location to identify your local representatives, and then lists contact information and instructions on what to say about various issues to each lawmaker. For example, if you live in Dallas and disagree with President Trump’s nominations, the site instructs you to call Senator John Cornyn and say, “Hi, I’m a resident of Dallas and I would like Senator Cornyn to vote against President Trump’s nominations for his cabinet. ” You will only get so far working alone. At some point, joining a group will help you coordinate broader actions like protests or coordinated phone calls. Where to find one? That will depend on your political beliefs: You will have to ask around or search social networks like Meetup. com, a site to find local events and people who share your interests. For example, on Meetup. com, you can click “Join a movement. ” From there, the site uses your location to find nearby activism groups. For San Francisco, the site pulled up organizations like #TheResistance, a group of Trump protesters with about 1, 700 members, and Tech Workers Coalition, a group of 130 technology workers who are activists. Some unique forms of activism can emerge from working with a team. Lea Yu, an organizer for Tech Workers Coalition, said she met fellow activists at a contest in December in which people were asked to make tech tools for political activism. In reaction to concerns about hate speech and fake news, Ms. Yu’s team whipped up AdStrike, a web tool that scans for advertisements appearing on Breitbart News, the   opinion and news website. The tool identifies the companies hosting ads on the site, takes a screenshot of the ad and composes a tweet that users can automatically post on their accounts, encouraging the business to stop advertising on Breitbart. “A single, lonesome tweet doesn’t get a consumer very far if they want a company to take a stand,” Ms. Yu said. “But when hundreds of tweets are coordinated, you see companies like Visa and Uber becoming very responsive. ”	1
718	  In a shocking report released Tuesday by the Multi-State Lottery Association, Wednesday’s lottery drawing worth an estimated $1.5 billion has been canceled due to “unethical match-fixing by the association.” The historical lottery prize amount raised suspicion with authorities prompting them to look into the“consistency and uniformity” of the balls used during the lottery sessions.What they found during their investigation, caused an immediate closure of lottery sales across the country. According to the report, many of the balls used were much lighter than the others. Prompting balls that were “non-winning numbers” to be pulled out of the machine. Authorities say they hope to have everyone informed to stop the sale of lottery tickets by end of business day today. A class action lawsuit has been filed by the Attorney General’s office, and they say the lottery Association will be responsible for returning the lost funds.	0
391	NEW DELHI  —   Jeena Sharma, 25, was applying for a work visa to the United States when news came that two Indian engineers had been shot in a Kansas bar by a man who drunkenly questioned their immigration status. News of the shootings, which took place last Wednesday, was quickly eclipsed by other developments in Washington, and even in Kansas, but the same cannot be said of the Sharma household of Mumbai, where Ms. Sharma has received emphatic maternal lectures about her plans to move, starting first thing in the morning. “She asked me: ‘Why do you even need to go to the States? Why do you need to go to a country that doesn’t want you? I’m going to be scared for your life every day,’” Ms. Sharma said. Even as she endeavored, patiently, to convey to her mother the difference between Kansas and New York City, where she hopes to move, Ms. Sharma felt her own apprehensions growing, as the days passed and President Trump made no statement on the crime. “It’s definitely very scary for me at the moment,” she said. “It’s almost as if a brown person is dead, like it doesn’t matter. ” The body of Srinivas Kuchibhotla, the    software engineer fatally shot in the Olathe, Kan. bar, was expected to arrive by Monday in Hyderabad, a technology hub where immigration to the United States has long been viewed as the surest path to success. Indians were relatively welcoming of Mr. Trump’s victory, and many here express admiration for his business empire and promised crackdown on terrorism. But even before Wednesday’s shootings, that optimism had been diluted by fears that America might no longer welcome immigrants. India is second only to China as a feeder to American colleges, with around 165, 000 students enrolled in the   school year, according to the Institute of International Education. Indians are the largest recipients of temporary skilled worker visas, known as   visas, which the Trump administration intends to cut back. And close to half a million Indians, who mostly went to the United States legally as students or tourists or on work visas, have stayed on after their visas expired, the Pew Research Center estimates. Reports of rising American hostility toward immigrants have stunned many Indians, said Alyssa Ayres, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, who visited Hyderabad recently. “I had a guy on a plane sitting next to me, who turned to me and said, ‘Is it true, what they say about America under Trump? ’” she said. “There is a kind of confusion: What is happening to the United States? People can’t believe what they’re reading. ” Ill treatment of Indian immigrants has, in the past, caused serious damage to bilateral relationships. In 2009 and 2010, reports of racially motivated crimes against Indian students in Australia set off demonstrations outside the Australian Embassy in New Delhi, where Australia’s prime minister was burned in effigy. After that, the number of Indians applying for student visas plunged by nearly half, with severe costs to Australian educational institutions. The diplomatic effect of the shootings in Kansas has been muted so far. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has not commented on them, though the subject will certainly be raised this week, along with the thorny issue of curtailing   visas, when Foreign Secretary Subrahmanyam Jaishankar visits Washington. Some Indians who had planned to go to the United States said they were hesitating. Manavi Das, who is considering several universities, said she was “constantly looking to see if the school is in a red state, or has witnessed a shooting in recent times. “After a certain event in November,” she said, “I have found my apprehensions turned up a notch. ” Sunny Choudhary, 23, said he had decided not to apply to graduate engineering programs in the United States, because “recent conditions, they are turning into, I think, hostile conditions. ” After Mr. Trump was elected, he added, “my parents said: ‘No, you should not go there. Now we won’t let you go there.’ ” He said that, like many of his friends, he had narrowed his search to Europe. And some Indian parents could use their persuasive talents to encourage their children to return home. “For this   period, after the transfer of regimes, I think Indians can come back and serve their country,” said Suguna Kadiyala, 73, whose daughter has been in the United States for 20 years. Nageswara Rao, 71, whose son and daughter work in the software sector in the United States, said he was “not much worried,” though he does dispense regular advice on safety measures. “It is always better to keep away from bars,” he said. His children are safe, he added, “because they don’t go to these bars where white people are more. ” He continued, “I give them advice to be a little bit careful and don’t get into a wrangle with anybody. Just have your own peaceful life. ”	1

276	WASHINGTON  —   President Trump said on Tuesday that the rise of   in the United States since his inauguration was “horrible” and “painful,” reacting publicly for the first time to mounting threats targeting Jewish people and institutions after he drew criticism for being slow to condemn them. During a visit to the National Museum of   History and Culture, Mr. Trump said he was reminded of the need to combat hatred “in all of its very ugly forms. ” He spoke one day after 11 bomb threats were phoned in to Jewish community centers around the country and a Jewish cemetery in University City, Mo. was vandalized. “The   threats targeting our Jewish community and community centers are horrible, and are painful, and a very sad reminder of the work that still must be done to root out hate and prejudice and evil,” Mr. Trump said. The statement came after weeks of private complaints from leaders of major Jewish organizations to members of Mr. Trump’s inner circle, including his    Jared Kushner, about the president’s seeming unwillingness to speak out forcefully against   acts. His failure to do so stoked concern among some Jewish leaders that Mr. Trump, whose presidential campaign drew the support of racist and   groups including the Ku Klux Klan, was at best willing to stay silent about such actions and at worst quietly condoning them. Mr. Trump’s comment on Tuesday was a rare concession to the demands of outside forces by a president who prides himself on standing his ground. Despite the questions that arose during his campaign, Mr. Trump has never proactively delivered a statement condemning  . “The president’s sudden acknowledgment of   is a   on the cancer of   that has infected his own administration,” said Steven Goldstein, the executive director of the Anne Frank Center for Mutual Respect. “When President Trump responds to   proactively and in real time, and without pleas and pressure, that’s when we’ll be able to say this president has turned a corner. ” He added, “This is not that moment. ” The White House was criticized by Jewish groups last month when it issued a statement honoring International Holocaust Remembrance Day that did not mention the six million Jews who perished, instead broadly mentioning “the depravity and horror inflicted on innocent people by Nazi terror” and “those who died. ” Pressed on the matter, Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, defended the statement as “inclusive” of all of those targeted during the Holocaust, including Gypsies, priests and gay people, and he called the criticism “pathetic. ” Concern mounted among Jewish leaders after a news conference last week at which Mr. Trump reacted angrily to a question about his response to the increasing number of   acts around the nation. The president called the query insulting and demanded that the questioner, who works for a Jewish publication, sit down. The   League called the president’s reaction “ . ” Mr. Trump, who was criticized during his campaign for being slow or halfhearted in condemning hate speech, has been particularly stung by accusations that he is   or that he has nurtured the rise of such sentiments. Such accusations have been leveled against both the president and his chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon, a former chairman of Breitbart News, a website that has cultivated a white nationalist following. The president’s daughter Ivanka Trump, who converted to Judaism to marry Mr. Kushner, an observant Jew, wrote in a Twitter post on Monday: “America is a nation built on the principle of religious tolerance. We must protect our houses of worship  religious centers. #JCC. ” JCC is the abbreviation for Jewish community centers. Morton A. Klein, the president of the Zionist Organization of America and a strong supporter of Mr. Trump, said, “One of the issues here is that President Trump and Steve Bannon are very upset and very frustrated that so many Jewish organizational leaders have accused them of being   which is very unfair and simply inaccurate. ” Mr. Klein added, though, that “President Trump needed to, himself  —   not through a statement by his daughter that didn’t even mention    —   speak up against this kind of hatred and urge law enforcement to do all they can to find these perpetrators and hold them accountable. ” The president’s slow response, he argued, may have been in part because Mr. Trump “wants to make these decisions on his own and not feel like he’s being told what to do. ” The proliferation of   acts in the United States and the president’s failure to address them publicly were frequent topics of conversation in Jerusalem over the weekend, where the leaders of American Jewish groups gathered for meetings, according to attendees who described the private discussions on the condition of anonymity. On Tuesday, several organizations issued statements praising Mr. Trump’s comments. “We appreciate that President Trump spoke directly to this matter,” said Nathan J. Diament, the executive director for public policy at the Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations of America. “The words of a president of the United States carry great weight, and it is important that Mr. Trump addressed the American Jewish community and all our fellow Americans at this time. ” Still, some leaders said they wished Mr. Trump had made a personal call for his administration to find and prosecute perpetrators of the recent   threats. The Simon Wiesenthal Center urged Mr. Trump to present a plan for combating   and called on Attorney General Jeff Sessions to form a task force on the matter. Mark Potok, a senior fellow at the Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks   activities, said the wave of threats was “really worrying,” especially because of the “tendency on the part of this administration to completely overlook terrorism and political violence from the domestic radical right. ” Mr. Potok also welcomed Mr. Trump’s comments, but he criticized them as tardy. “It’s very nice that President Trump opposes these crimes,” Mr. Potok said. “It might have been helpful if he had done so months or even years earlier. ” Mr. Spicer complained on Tuesday that Mr. Trump was being treated unfairly. “It’s ironic that, no matter how many times he talks about this, that it’s never good enough,” he said at a briefing with reporters. He declined to respond to a shouted question about whether Mr. Trump would ask the Justice Department to prosecute those responsible for the   acts. Mr. Trump has mentioned his Jewish grandchildren and daughter when questioned about his commitment to combating  . Yet defenses of Judaism that do not involve fealty to Israel have proved tougher for a man raised in New York, a city heavily populated with Jews. In an interview with Jake Tapper of CNN at the end of February 2016, soon after Mr. Trump won the South Carolina primary, Mr. Trump demurred when pressed repeatedly about the support offered to him by David Duke, a former Ku Klux Klan leader. “Honestly, I don’t know David Duke,” Mr. Trump said at the time. Asked by reporters days later why he would not simply disavow Mr. Duke, Mr. Trump shrugged and said, “I disavow, O. K.?”	1
47	WASHINGTON  —   President Trump vowed on Friday to order new security measures by next week intended to stop terrorists from entering the United States, even as aides debated whether to ask the Supreme Court to reinstate his original travel ban that has now been blocked by lower courts. A day after a   panel rebuffed him, Mr. Trump said he might sign “a   order” as early as Monday that would be aimed at accomplishing the same purpose but, presumably, with a stronger legal basis. While he vowed to keep fighting for the original order in court, he indicated that he would not wait for the process to play out to take action. “We will win that battle,” he told reporters on Air Force One as he flew to Florida for a weekend golf outing with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan. Yet noting that it most likely would not happen quickly, he also raised the possibility of “a lot of other options, including just filing a   order. ” Asked if he would do that, Mr. Trump said, “We need speed for reasons of security, so it very well could be. ” The president’s pivot represented a   tactical retreat even as he insisted that he would prevail in the long run. The battle over his order, which suspended refugee flows and temporarily blocked visitors from seven predominantly Muslim countries, has come to define Mr. Trump’s young presidency both at home and abroad, and has tested his capacity to impose his will on a political and legal system that he has vowed to master but that has resisted his demands. Mr. Trump typically prefers a fight, but drafting a new travel order would acknowledge that sometimes a president must find other ways to proceed. Asked to describe what he had in mind for a new executive order, he said: “We’re going to have very, very strong vetting. I call it extreme vetting, and we’re going very strong on security. We are going to have people coming to our country that want to be here for good reason. ” White House officials denied news reports that the president would not appeal the case to the Supreme Court. “All options remain on the table,” Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, said by email late Friday. A new version of the executive order would amount to a tacit admission that the administration would not be able to quickly or easily overturn the decision issued on Thursday by a panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. Even some conservative lawyers allied with the White House said there was little chance of prevailing right away with the Supreme Court, which is divided along ideological lines with a seat vacant. Emboldened by the appeals court, Democrats attacked Mr. Trump for trying to subvert American values. “I promise you, we will fight back,” Representative Joseph Crowley of New York, the chairman of the House Democratic Caucus, said in his party’s weekly radio and internet address. “We will resist. We will resist on behalf of what is American. And we will resist on behalf of the immigrants who came here in the past and who will come here in the future. ” Mr. Trump has other ways to soldier on. The Ninth Circuit decision left in place a temporary restraining order blocking the travel order, but did not rule on the underlying constitutional or legal issues of the case. The president could ask the full Ninth Circuit to hear an appeal on the restraining order, or he could return to the lower courts for a battle over the merits, which would take longer to conclude. The administration was still fighting battles in other courts across the nation. Lawyers for the Justice Department were back in court in Alexandria, Va. outside the nation’s capital, arguing against a preliminary injunction that would halt the travel ban from being enforced nationwide. Given multiple challenges, the idea of starting over appealed to the White House. Edward Whelan, the president of the Ethics and Public Policy Center and an advocate of Mr. Trump’s Supreme Court nominee, Judge Neil M. Gorsuch, wrote on Twitter that it was “utterly crazy” to expect the justices to overturn Thursday’s ruling. As a result, Mr. Whelan wrote, it would be better to develop a “sensible” executive order and unveil it “with clear expectations” for carrying it out. The original executive order issued last month barred refugees from anywhere in the world from entering the United States for 120 days and refugees from Syria indefinitely. It also cut off visitors for 90 days from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. Mr. Trump said he needed time to tighten screening procedures. White House officials could draft a new order that would address some of the concerns raised by the judges. A new order, for instance, could explicitly state that it did not apply to permanent legal residents holding green cards. After some initial crossed signals, the White House and the Department of Homeland Security have said Mr. Trump’s original ban does not affect green card holders, but the appeals court judges pointed out that was not in the text of the order. The White House could also narrow the categories of people affected, or change the list of countries targeted. And it could take out provisions intended to give preference to religious minorities, which in Muslim countries would refer to Christians, among others. Mr. Trump said in a television interview that he wanted to give preference to Christian refugees, but the judges expressed concern about a religious rule that could be discriminatory. Mr. Trump has also argued that the restrictions were necessary to stop terrorists from entering the United States, citing attacks in Europe over the past year. As the United States has struggled with terrorism since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, no one has been killed in a terrorist attack on American soil by anyone from one of those seven countries  —   a point noted by the judges  —   although some   attackers from them have been thwarted. The White House could try to offer a stronger rationale for why a temporary ban would actually stop terrorism. In his weekly address, Mr. Trump told Americans he was “committed to your security” and would not be deterred by criticism of his order. “We will not allow our generous system of immigration to be turned against us as a tool for terrorism and truly bad people,” he said. Mr. Trump’s attacks on the judiciary have drawn criticism. He initially called a federal district judge in Seattle who first blocked his executive order a “  judge” and said Americans should blame the judge if there were a terrorist attack. When the appeals court took up the case, he said a “bad high school student” would uphold the order. Mr. Trump started Friday with another attack on the appeals court ruling, calling it “a disgraceful decision. ” But for much of the rest of the day, he avoided the incendiary language he has been using. At a White House news conference with Mr. Abe before flying to Florida, he said he would fight in court, but did not address the judges. Mr. Trump suggested that he had learned more about the threat of terrorism from intelligence briefings since he took office. “While I’ve been president, which is just for a very short period of time, I’ve learned tremendous things that you could only learn, frankly, if you were in a certain position, namely president,” he said. “And there are tremendous threats to our country. We will not allow that to happen. I can tell you that right now. We will not allow that to happen. ”	1
357	SAN FRANCISCO  —   Waymo, the   car business spun out of Google’s parent company, claimed in a federal lawsuit on Thursday that Uber was using intellectual property stolen by one of Google’s former project leaders. In a federal court filing in San Francisco, Waymo said Anthony Levandowski, who runs Uber’s autonomous car division, downloaded 14, 000 files from Google a month before leaving to start his own   car company, Otto. Uber acquired Otto in August for $680 million, about seven months after Mr. Levandowski left Google. “Otto and Uber have taken Waymo’s intellectual property so that they could avoid incurring the risk, time, and expense of independently developing their own technology,” the company said in the filing. “Ultimately, this calculated theft reportedly netted Otto employees over half a billion dollars and allowed Uber to revive a stalled program, all at Waymo’s expense. ” Uber did not respond to requests for comment. In its filing, Waymo said it was inadvertently copied on an email from one of its suppliers with drawings of Uber’s circuit board design for its lidar technology, short for light detection and ranging, ” that are   sensors used in   cars. Waymo said Uber’s design bore “a striking resemblance” to its proprietary and highly secret design and infringed on Waymo’s patents. Waymo also said that a number of Google employees, who subsequently left to join Mr. Levandowski at Otto, downloaded additional trade secrets before departing. These included supplier lists, manufacturing details and technical information, Waymo said. The suit accuses Uber of stealing trade secrets, infringing on patents and competing unfairly in an effort to catch up on autonomous vehicle technology. Otto was the brainchild of a handful of former Google employees who pioneered autonomous vehicle research at the search giant. Mr. Levandowski, who had been at Google nine years, led that effort. He is a prominent figure in the world of   vehicles, having worked on the technology for more than a decade and achieving some degree of renown as a graduate student at the University of California, Berkeley, in 2004, when he designed a   motorcycle that was entered in the Pentagon’s first contest for autonomous vehicles. Later, when Google began working on   cars, it acquired Mr. Levandowski’s   510 Systems. Mr. Levandowski left Google in early 2016 to found Otto with Lior Ron, who also was experienced in autonomous vehicle research and digital mapping. Waymo noted in its suit that the sale to Uber closed shortly after Mr. Levandowski received his final “multimillion dollar” compensation payment from Google. Companies in Silicon Valley and Detroit are betting big on   car technology. And the intense interest has spawned a string of expensive investments and lawsuits. Last year, General Motors paid more than $1 billion for Cruise Automation, an autonomous vehicle technology   and Ford recently announced plans to invest $1 billion over five years in Argo AI, an artificial intelligence   formed in December. In January, Tesla filed a lawsuit against Sterling Anderson, a former director of the company’s Autopilot program, saying that he broke his employment contract by trying to recruit Tesla employees to join a new   car company. Tesla’s suit, filed against Mr. Anderson and his partner Chris Urmson, a former Google employee, also claims that Mr. Anderson took proprietary information and tried to cover his tracks by destroying information. In December, Google’s parent company, Alphabet, said that its    autonomous vehicle project was spinning off from its research lab X and would operate as a   company called Waymo. Alphabet said its decision to spin out Waymo was a signal that the company thought its   technology had advanced beyond research project status and was ready for commercialization. Waymo executives have said it is open to using the technology in many ways, including a   service to compete with Uber. For Uber, Otto represents a significant bet on the future of transportation. Mr. Levandowski was named vice president of Uber’s   technology, and he reports directly to Travis Kalanick, the company’s chief executive. Mr. Levandowski leads Uber’s Advanced Technologies Center in Pittsburgh, the epicenter of the company’s testing and   efforts. Uber has said it could be years before   vehicles enter wide mainstream use. But the company has already deployed early tests in Pittsburgh and Tempe, Ariz. where the public can travel in prototype vehicles. In Fort Collins, Colo. Otto recently completed its first   truck delivery, a   beer delivery for Budweiser. Uber has also struck a deal with Volvo to jointly develop a   vehicle, the   early versions of it have been released in some cities. In December, Uber ran into opposition to a test of its   Volvo   in San Francisco, an operation the California Department of Motor Vehicles said was illegal because Uber did not hold the proper permits. One week later, Uber relented,  redirecting its test to Tempe and pulling a fleet of its   cars out of the Bay Area. Uber, now privately valued at nearly $70 billion, has raised a dizzying amount of money from venture capitalists around Silicon Valley. One of its early investors was GV, the venture capital arm of Alphabet. In August, David Drummond, a longtime Alphabet executive who was instrumental in GV’s $250 million investment in Uber in 2013, stepped down from his seat on Uber’s board of directors as it became increasingly clear the two companies were on a collision course. It has been a difficult week for Uber. The company is still reeling from a blog post written by Susan Fowler, a former Uber employee, who claimed she was sexually harassed by a manager at the company and was ignored when she complained to the human resources department. The company said it was investigating Ms. Fowler’s claims and other concerns about a toxic workplace culture. Mitch and Freada Kapor, early investors in Uber, wrote in a blog post on Thursday that they are frustrated with the company’s inability to change its culture, despite their attempts to help. They also expressed concern about the independence of the investigation, which will be led by Eric H. Holder Jr. the former United States attorney general, and Arianna Huffington, an Uber board member. Mr. Holder has been paid to work on behalf of Uber since at least 2016, they wrote, and Ms. Huffington’s board seat also compromises her independence. Mr. Holder and Tammy Albarran, a partner at the law firm Covington and Burling who is working on the investigation, said the inquiry would be “thorough, impartial and objective. ”	1
50	After a swelling tide of protests, the president of Yale announced on Saturday that the university would change the name of a residential college commemorating John C. Calhoun, the   white supremacist statesman from South Carolina. The college will be renamed for Grace Murray Hopper, a trailblazing computer scientist and Navy rear admiral who received a master’s degree and a doctorate from Yale. The decision was a stark reversal of the university’s decision last spring to maintain the name despite broad opposition. Though the president, Peter Salovey, said that he was still “concerned about erasing history,” he said that “these are exceptional circumstances. ” “I made this decision because I think it is the right thing to do on principle,” Mr. Salovey said on a conference call with reporters. “John C. Calhoun’s principles, his legacy as an ardent supporter of slavery as a positive good, are at odds with this university. ” Mr. Salovey and the other members of the Yale Corporation, the university’s governing body, made their decision after an advisory committee unanimously recommended the renaming. The school is still determining when exactly the change will be carried out, but Mr. Salovey said it would be by fall at the latest. Students reacted with joy to a change many said was long overdue. “There’s a huge sense of relief and celebration,” said Rianna   21, a senior from Ann Arbor, Mich. who was involved in the protests. “Students of color have been fighting for this change for decades and it’s hard to believe this day is finally here. ” Online, some students found inspiration in a quotation from Ms. Hopper, who died in 1992. “Humans are allergic to change,” she once said. “They love to say, ‘We’ve always done it this way.’ I try to fight that. ” Calhoun, the nation’s seventh vice president, attended Yale and was its valedictorian. The name of the college incited controversy almost as soon as it opened in 1933. Many black students staged demonstrations and referred to the college, which was decorated with depictions of slaves carrying bales of cotton, as the “Calhoun Plantation. ” Opposition may have peaked in 2015, after the massacre of nine worshipers at a black church in Charleston. The killings, by an avowed white supremacist, prompted protests that led to the removal of the Confederate battle flag outside the South Carolina Statehouse and elsewhere. Yale was seized that fall by a series of demonstrations from students, faculty and alumni who objected to the Calhoun name, as well as to what they saw as a larger climate of racial inequality on campus. Many universities, domestic and abroad, have faced similar pressure in recent years to eradicate names and symbols of racism and colonialism on campus. That resistance notwithstanding, Mr. Salovey announced last April that Yale would preserve the Calhoun name. At the same time, he revealed that the university’s two new residential colleges would be named for Benjamin Franklin and Anna Pauline Murray. The honoring of Ms. Murray, a legal scholar and civil rights activist who graduated from Yale Law School in 1965, was widely hailed as the first such distinction bestowed on either a woman or an  . But the selection of Franklin, who was once a slaveholder himself, was derided by many students, particularly after it became clear that he was chosen in deference to a suggestion by Charles B. Johnson, a businessman who donated $250 million for the new buildings  —   the largest gift in the school’s history. Addressing a related concern, the school also decided then that the leaders of the residential colleges would no longer use the title “master,” and would instead be called “heads of college,” a recognition of the discomfort many students felt toward the previous honorific’s evocation of slavery. The Calhoun and Franklin decisions reignited protests from student activists, who held a “renaming ceremony” in front of the college in which they called it “the college formerly known as Calhoun. ” At a town   meeting soon after, students showered Mr. Salovey with fake $1 million bills, a protest against what they saw as the university prioritizing its financial interests over their concerns. The dissent did not come only from students. Over the summer, a black dishwasher in Calhoun smashed a stained glass windowpane that depicted slaves working on a plantation, because he said he found the image degrading. And on Friday, four demonstrators protesting the Calhoun name were arrested for blocking the street. Still, despite their delight about the renaming, many students hope that the university will continue to move beyond symbolism to address more pressing issues of racial inequality on campus, like the dearth of black faculty members. During the fall 2015 protests, the university announced that it was committing $50 million to a   initiative to confront the fact that less than 3 percent of its arts and sciences faculty is black. But since that time, several prominent black professors have left the university. About 11 percent of Yale’s roughly 5, 400 undergraduates identify themselves as black or  . “This is definitely a victory, but we’re not done fighting,” Ms.   said. “It’s our job to keep pushing Yale in the right direction. ”	1

Is it true?Over 600 Aborted Fetuses Found In Storage Freezer Of Alabama McDonald’s — Restaurant Closed  A gruesome discovery has taken place in the basement of a Mobile, Alabama McDonald’s restaurant. Health inspectors found the restaurant was substituting “chicken” with aborted fetuses purchased from the local Planned Parenthood clinic. The Asian owned franchise was said to be producing their own nuggets rather than purchasing them from their ‘corporate approved’ supplier.It all began when several customers issued complaints with the Alabama Department of Public Health stating that a foul smell was coming from the back of the restaurant. Other customers complained that the McNuggets tasted rather “gamey” and not like other nuggets from different franchise locations. There were a handful of other complaints concerning the sanitary conditions of the restaurant.	0
341	TESTOSTERONE REXMyths of Sex, Science, and SocietyBy Cordelia Fine 266 pp. W. W. Norton  Company. $26. 95. If you hear a metallic rasp as you open the cover of Cordelia Fine’s new book, don’t be alarmed. It’s just the sound of the author sharpening her knives, the better to carve up the carcass of what she calls “Testosterone Rex”: the big, scaly body of assumptions, preconceptions, conjectures and distortions regarding “what men are like” and “what women are like. ” Fine takes on this king of all biases with admirable vigor, and it’s a pleasure  —   albeit a strenuous one  —   to follow the action as she dismembers the beast. She dissects as she goes, bringing a probing intelligence not only to what we believe about gender, and why it’s often wrong, but also to the history of how we came to think it was so. And lest we think gender stereotypes are themselves history, Fine produces an array of wincingly recent portrayals drawn from popular media. Like this rhetorical question from The Financial Times, meant to make clear why natural selection favored a taste for  : “Were the young women of the tribe more impressed when the cautious described their uneventful days,” the columnist John Kay asks, “or when the bold recalled their heroic escape from danger?” Kay exhibits little awareness of the possibility that those rapt “young women” might be independent agents who themselves chose to take risks, or not. Fine, an associate professor at the University of Melbourne, is also willing to take a blade to the work of some of her fellow academics. She notes that Larry Cahill, a neurobiologist at the University of California, Irvine, has likened women and men to “very different kinds of car”: specifically, a Volvo and a Corvette. “Perhaps not coincidentally,” Fine dryly observes, “one is a nice, safe family vehicle with plenty of room in the trunk for groceries the other is designed to offer power and status. ” With keen precision and sharp humor, Fine shows how deeply our assumptions about gender are embedded in the questions that we  —   scientists, journalists and the rest of us  —   pose, the analogies we choose, even the options we’re offered on surveys. Built into the very structures of our thinking is the notion of women as less: less lustful, less competitive, less aggressive than men. Fine holds one such belief after another up to the light and wonders: How do we know this is true? Often, it turns out, it’s not true to the extent we imagine, or not true at all. Take, for instance, that presumption  —   apparently supported by science  —   that men are more enthusiastic   than women. The finding is based on male and female subjects’ responses to survey questions about their propensity to engage in risky behaviors. As Fine observes, however, “researchers have to make decisions about the kinds of risks they decide to investigate”  —   and the kinds of risk they have consistently decided upon have a culturally masculine cast, focused on activities like sports betting, financial investments, motorcycle riding and extreme sports like sky diving or bungee jumping. The author continues: “Although women routinely take risks, these often seem to slip under the research radar. For example, with divorce rates hovering close to 50 percent, being the one to quit or scale back your job when children arrive is a significant economic risk. Going on a date can end in sexual assault. Leaving a marriage is financially, socially and emotionally risky. In the United States, being pregnant is about 20 times more likely to result in death than is a sky dive. ” Our habit of defining risk in traditionally male terms has rigged the game against the perception of women as   in their own right. Well, then, what about the even more entrenched idea that evolution has primed men to desire many and varied sex partners? Here Fine quotes the Bradley University psychologist David Schmitt: “Consider that one man can produce as many as 100 offspring by indiscriminately mating with 100 women in a given year, whereas a man who is monogamous will tend to have only one child with his partner during that same time period. ” Fine expertly fillets this familiar premise, noting, among other inconvenient facts, that “the probability of a woman becoming pregnant from a single randomly timed act of intercourse is about 3 percent,” and that in historical and traditional societies, as many as 80 to 90 percent of women of reproductive age at any one time might already be pregnant, or infertile while they were  . “The theoretical possibility that a male could produce dozens of offspring if he mated with dozens of females is of little consequence if, in reality, there are few females available to fertilize,” Fine comments. Think about it: For every man on the prowl, there simply aren’t a hundred women available to bear his child. For all men not named Genghis Khan, monogamy must have started to look like a pretty smart bet. Again and again, Fine questions the way we think of biological sex “as a fundamental force in development that creates not just two kinds of reproductive system, but two kinds of people. ” (Or as she quotes yet another academic: “Psychologically, men and women are almost a different species. ”) Fine offers a satisfying counterpoint to this claim: People, she writes, are so different from one another as to seem members of multiple species  —   a variety not constrained or contained by dichotomous categories of male and female. Indeed, the fantastic diversity of Earth’s   is one of Fine’s recurring themes. To the many nonhuman species she writes about, the author brings her characteristically vivid descriptions and droll humor: We learn that male and female African forest weaver birds sing together, in unison that male macaque monkeys sometimes carry and groom their babies that female sandpipers are shamelessly promiscuous. (“While ‘promiscuous’ is a highly   term, no moral judgment whatsoever is implied by its application here,” Fine writes. “Not even for those slutty sandpipers. ”) Fine is also quite funny when observing how gender roles play out in her own life, and how stereotypes attach to her vocation as a feminist science writer. When she told her young son  —   who, she notes, “has a strange, unchildlike interest in taxidermy”  —   that it was time to get the family dog neutered, he excitedly suggested turning the testicles into a key ring. Fine remarks: “Contrary to a prevailing view of the feminist as the kind of person who could think of no more inspiring and motivating a start to the workday than to unlock her office with a set of keys from which dangles a   pair of testicles, I strongly vetoed my son’s suggestion. ” Colorful zoological anecdotes and amusing domestic interludes provide a welcome respite from the author’s   argument. If her book has a fault, it is that it is rather too thoroughly argued. The indomitable Fine amasses evidence, addresses objections and accumulates footnotes at such a brisk pace that the panting reader wishes at times for a water break. There’s no doubt, however, that such tireless energy is just what’s needed to slay a monster of this gargantuan size and this determined tenacity. Beliefs about men and women are as old as humanity itself, but Fine’s funny, spiky book gives reason to hope that we’ve heard Testosterone rex’s last roar.	1
415	LOS ANGELES  —   It’s one of Hollywood’s most secretive and unusual jobs: Brian Cullinan, a partner at the accounting firm PwC, and a colleague are tasked with making sure the statuettes at the annual Academy Awards are correctly distributed. He stands in the wings of the Dolby Theater here in a tuxedo and pulls sealed envelopes out of a briefcase, giving the correct one to presenters as they walk onto the stage. This is the one night a year when the   PwC really gets to shine. The firm’s chief executive sits with stars in the audience. Mr. Cullinan walks the red carpet, where reporters often say he resembles Matt Damon. He told one TV crew that he had no nerves. “We’ve done this a few times,” he said before Sunday night’s show, “and we prepare a lot. ” He was so at ease, he even found time to tweet from backstage about Emma Stone as the show neared its climax. Whoops. In an epic bungle before 33 million viewers  —   one that could get his company fired as the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences’ accountant after 83 years and which robbed “Moonlight,” an     film, of its proper moment of celebration  —   Mr. Cullinan caused the   musical “La La Land” to be mistakenly named best picture at the 89th Academy Awards. PwC’s chief executive watched the scene from the third row. At the climactic moment backstage, a crew member shouted “Oh my God” as the jubilant producers of “La La Land” thanked their families. “He got the wrong envelope!” “He” was Warren Beatty, who, along with Faye Dunaway, presented the final award of the night. Mr. Beatty opened the envelope and, after some hesitation, handed it to Ms. Dunaway. She said that “La La Land,” about young California dreamers, was the winner. The crowd erupted in applause, and the “La La Land” team rushed the stage. Why did it take minutes to fix the error? “PwC sounded the alarm, but not right away,” Gary Natoli, the telecast’s stage manager, said in a text message. “It wasn’t until just before I jumped onstage that it was confirmed by both Brian and Martha as the winner being incorrect. ” Martha L. Ruiz, a PwC colleague of Mr. Cullinan’s who stood on the opposite side of the stage, and Mr. Cullinan apparently needed to find each other backstage to confer before speaking up. It was one of the most surprising reversals in Oscar history, as human error combined with live television to powerful,   effect. It also warped and dampened the euphoria of film executives and artists who had spent years working on the two movies. And for the academy, which had been criticized last year for failing to nominate any minority actors for the second consecutive year, there was a missed moment: Instead of a proper celebration of “Moonlight,” there was a televised scene of confusion, disbelief and astonishment. Backstage, Michael De Luca and Jennifer Todd, the telecast’s producers, were sitting at their monitors, Diet Cokes in hand. They were under the impression that the show was a wrap. But the scene quickly became chaotic, as it emerged that the winner was, in fact, “Moonlight,” a tender drama about a young, black man coming to terms with his homosexuality. “I’m holding the envelope and the award, and I had just given my speech, and there are people on the stage with headsets and I thought, ‘That doesn’t seem right,’” Jordan Horowitz, a “La La Land” producer, recalled. Exactly what happened in the moments leading up to the mistaken announcement was still being sorted out on Monday, but pieces of the story began falling into place. Mr. Cullinan  —   perhaps distracted by his Twitter feed  —   handed Mr. Beatty an envelope containing the name of the best actress winner, an award that had already been given to Ms. Stone of “La La Land. ” The next seven humiliating minutes would find Ms. Dunaway blurting out the wrong best picture winner, the   audience gasping and   and a dance onstage as “La La Land” producers gracefully made way for the “Moonlight” team. “I haven’t received any formal explanation,” Marc Platt, another member of the “La La Land” producing team, said on Monday afternoon. “There may have been disappointment in the moment, tremendous disappointment, but the good news is that I feel a unity in our community today. ‘Moonlight’ won best picture. But many voices in many kinds of films were honored. ” This account of the awards show’s frantic final moments was based on interviews with producers of both “La La Land” and “Moonlight” academy officials crew members for the telecast and PwC executives. Some provided information on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly. An academy spokeswoman directed queries to PwC. Another academy official said the organization had initiated a review of the backstage process and of the group’s association going forward with the accounting firm, which extends beyond balloting for the Oscars. “I read the card that was in the envelope,” Mr. Beatty told reporters on his way to the Governors Ball, a   party. “I thought, ‘This is very strange because it says best actress on the card.’ And I felt that maybe there was some sort of misprint. ” Pressed further, he said, “That’s all I have to say on the subject. ” Ms. Dunaway declined to comment. For its part, PwC expressed remorse. “We are owning this mistake,” said Tim Ryan, the United States chairman of PwC. “I’ve reached out to the academy. I’ve shared my personal apology, the firm’s apology, and I’ve begun to talk to them about things we can do to make it right. ” The firm declined to make Mr. Cullinan available for an interview, but it later said that once he mistakenly handed out the wrong envelope, “protocols for correcting it were not followed through quickly enough by Mr. Cullinan or his partner. ” In keeping with past practice, PwC prepared two identical sets of sealed envelopes before the Oscars show. Ms. Ruiz kept a complete set on one side of the stage, while Mr. Cullinan had another set on the other. It was Ms. Ruiz who handed the best actress envelope to Leonardo DiCaprio, who presented the award to Ms. Stone. (As they walked off the stage, Mr. DiCaprio handed her the envelope and said, “Make sure you keep this. ”) Next up: Mr. Beatty and Ms. Dunaway, reuniting to mark the 50th anniversary of “Bonnie and Clyde” and announce the best picture winner. It was then that Mr. Cullinan handed Mr. Beatty the spare   envelope instead of the   envelope. What led to the mistake by Mr. Cullinan was not known, but it could have to do with the envelope’s design. The academy used a new envelope this year, featuring red paper with gold outside lettering that specifies the award inside. That may have made the outside of the envelopes more difficult to read than last year’s, which featured gold paper and red lettering. Mr. Natoli, the stage manager, was the one who approached Mr. Horowitz, the “La La Land” producer, to see that the envelope he was holding was the spare announcing Ms. Stone’s acting win. “The guys in headsets were going around with urgency looking for the other envelope,” Mr. Horowitz said. “One of the guys opens it, and it says ‘Moonlight,’ and I took it onstage and went to the microphone and said what I said. ” Mr. Horowitz reacted quickly. “You guys, I’m sorry, no,” he said from the stage. “There’s a mistake. ‘Moonlight,’ you guys won best picture. ” For the filmmakers and actors in “Moonlight,” those final minutes were no less stunning. “We all looked at each other and were like, ‘Is this a joke? ’” the actor Andre Holland said later. “We waited and kept watching. We didn’t want to celebrate until we knew if it was a joke and whether this was really happening. ” As soon as the show ended, Dawn Hudson, the academy’s chief executive, jumped from her seat in the theater and marched backstage. Ms. Hudson and Cheryl Boone Isaacs, the academy’s president, gathered Ms. Dunaway, Mr. Beatty, the PwC accountants and other crew members into the theater’s green room. “I’ve never seen Dawn look that mad,” a crew member said.	1
370	WASHINGTON  —   The White House press secretary, Sean Spicer, has taken to slapping journalists who write unflattering stories with an epithet he sees as the epitome of   New York   gossip: “Page Six reporter. ” Whether the New   spokesman realizes it or not, the expression is perhaps less an insult than a reminder of an era when Donald J. Trump mastered the New York tabloid terrain  —   and his own narrative  —   shaping his image with a combination of    bluster and    gossip. He’s not in Manhattan anymore. This New   of politicians, now an idiosyncratic,     president, has stumbled into the most conventional of Washington traps: believing he can master an entrenched political press corps with far deeper connections to the permanent government of federal law enforcement and executive department officials than he has. Instead, President Trump has found himself subsumed and increasingly infuriated by the leaks and criticisms he has long prided himself on vanquishing. Now, goaded by Stephen K. Bannon, his chief strategist, Mr. Trump has turned on the news media with escalating rhetoric, labeling major outlets as “the enemy of the American people. ” His latest swipe  —   pulling out of Washington’s   nerd prom  —   came via Twitter on Saturday. “I will not be attending the White House Correspondents’ Association Dinner this year,” Mr. Trump wrote. “Please wish everyone well and have a great evening!” He has made a sharp break from previous presidents  —   and from his own comfortable   tango with the tabloids. “New York is extremely intense and competitive, but it is actually a much smaller pond than Washington, where you have many more players with access to many more sources,” said Howard Wolfson, who has split his career between New York and Washington, advising former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and Hillary Clinton’s 2008 presidential campaign. “In New York, you can create a manageable set of relationships in a smaller universe,” Mr. Wolfson said. “In Washington, that becomes a lot more complicated. ” There is another fundamental difference: During his Page Six days, Mr. Trump was, by and large, trafficking in trivia. As president, he is dealing with the most serious issues of the day. They involve the nation’s safety and prosperity, and it is the role of news organizations to cover them. If Mr. Trump’s    relationship with reporters had a model back then, people close to him say, it was the gregarious,    style of Edward I. Koch, the   New York mayor. But his mood in Washington has turned darker, and over the last week he has executed, alongside Mr. Bannon and Mr. Spicer, what amounts to the most sustained White House campaign against the news media since Richard M. Nixon’s second term. “It’s like Nixonian times again,” said George Rush, a veteran New York gossip columnist who has covered Mr. Trump for decades. “I just thought he would have a thicker skin. ” Linda Stasi, who chronicled Mr. Trump’s    marriage to Marla Maples in the 1990s for two New York papers, said she could have predicted the presidential agita. “He would plant stories and he would get mad if they didn’t come out exactly as he wanted,” she recalled of earlier dealings with Mr. Trump. “It never occurred to him that he couldn’t control everything. ” Now, Ms. Stasi said, “he is shocked that he is not in control of the press. ” Attacking the news media, which has an abysmal approval rating among Republican voters, is sound politics in the short term. But Mr. Trump’s fury is less strategic than heartfelt. He watches cable TV at night and exhorts aides like Mr. Spicer and his policy adviser Stephen Miller to be tougher, according to White House aides. His anger is compounded by his belief that he should still be able to plant and steer stories. That was a lot easier to do when he was running a   real estate and branding business with an aggressive legal team that demanded that nearly everyone in his orbit sign nondisclosure agreements. For the first time in his life, Mr. Trump is on the public payroll and subject to a tangle of laws and rules no businessman  —   especially one accustomed to overseeing every aspect of a relatively small family business  —   would tolerate. To some extent, the clash with the press was inevitable. Mr. Trump may be noisier and more confrontational than many of his predecessors, but he is being   lessons all presidents eventually learn  —   that the iron triangle of the Washington press corps, West Wing staff and federal bureaucracy is simply too powerful to bully. Mr. Trump’s relationship with the press during the 2016 campaign was rocky and paradoxical. He was, at times, accessible  —   frequently calling reporters to kibbitz, complain or make news. But as the resentments piled up, his staff, led by Corey Lewandowski, his first campaign manager, made a point of snubbing journalists it did not like and confining reporters to a small pen at rallies. Mr. Trump quickly realized, aides said, that his attacks on the “dishonest” news media were as popular as his hits on “crooked” Hillary Clinton. The addition of Mr. Bannon to the campaign team last summer gave the jostling hostility a sharper edge. Last month, Mr. Bannon described the   relationship as “a war” in an interview with The New York Times. “I want you to quote this,” he said. “The media here is the opposition party. They don’t understand this country. They still do not understand why Donald Trump is the president of the United States. ” Things have deteriorated since then. The White House, on the defensive last week after a series of missteps and leaked stories, sought to shift to offense, targeting the news media as an enemy, in the absence of any more formidable foil in a city now firmly controlled by Republicans. Mr. Bannon, a former Goldman Sachs executive and Hollywood producer who made a fortune from the syndication of TV shows, described the “corporatist media” as the “opposition party” in a speech on Thursday. The next day, Mr. Spicer excluded selected news organizations, including The New York Times, Politico and CNN, from a   version of his daily briefing. Then there was Mr. Trump’s   attack on “fake news” during his speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference on Friday, which was met with shouts of approval from the conservative faithful. Reporters back in New York, however, knew that the president’s call for an end to “sources”  —   meaning anonymous sources leaking damaging details of his campaign’s relationship with Russian officials  —   did not jibe with his onetime role as a   gossipmonger, trumpeting his business dealings and romantic life in   phone calls. “I’m against the people that make up stories and make up sources,” Mr. Trump said. “They shouldn’t be allowed to use sources unless they use somebody’s name. Let their name be put out there. Let their name be put out. ” “He used to be the one leaking!” Ms. Stasi pointed out on Friday from her office at The Daily News, where she is a columnist. “He was leaking about himself. He would call up with fake accents and pretend it wasn’t him. He would tell us 100 times: ‘Now listen, I’m going to tell you something, but it didn’t come from me. ’” Mr. Trump, who taunted his   critics on Friday  —   “Let ’em say it to my face!”  —   hid his own identity to push   stories in the 1980s, posing as his own   man under the fake names John Miller and John Barron. Despite his dominance of social media, Mr. Trump still retains a slightly anachronistic view of the press. He prefers ink to pixels, asking staff members to print out online articles and reviewing the day’s newspapers  —   black Sharpie in hand  —   with Mr. Spicer in the Oval Office at the end of each work day. Mr. Trump reads bylines and remembers them. He also keeps obsessive track of his presence in the press. During an interview at Trump Tower last spring, the future president proudly showed off a boardroom filled entirely with stacks of magazines and newspapers featuring his visage. The publications, which covered an entire conference table, ran the spectrum from The Wall Street Journal to The Hollywood Reporter to Newsweek and Time. Framed copies of Playboy, TV Guide and Variety hung on the walls. It was a living, expanding shrine to his political rise  —   and a physical manifestation of his media fixation. Still, for a sophisticated consumer of news, Mr. Trump retains a brutally simple, almost Manichaean view of his coverage: good stories are good, bad stories are evil. It could prove an untenable attribute for the most scrutinized man in the world. “He loves the press he lives for it,” Howard Stern, a frequent Trump interviewer and friend, said this month. “He wants to be liked he wants to be loved. ” Being president, Mr. Stern added, is not “going to be a healthy experience. ”	1

49	WASHINGTON  —   Across the vast federal bureaucracy, Donald J. Trump’s arrival in the White House has spread anxiety, frustration, fear and resistance among many of the two million nonpolitical civil servants who say they work for the public, not a particular president. At the Environmental Protection Agency, a group of scientists strategized this past week about how to   President Trump’s environmental orders without being fired. At the Treasury Department, civil servants are quietly gathering information about   protections as they polish their résumés. At the United States Digital Service  —   the youthful cadre of employees who left jobs at Google, Facebook or Microsoft to join the Obama administration  —   workers are debating how to stop Mr. Trump should he want to use the databases they made more efficient to target specific immigrant groups. “It’s almost a sense of dread, as in, what will happen to us,” said Gabrielle Martin, a trial lawyer and   veteran at the Denver office of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, where colleagues now share daily, grim predictions about the fate of their jobs under Mr. Trump’s leadership. “It’s like the movie music when the shark is coming,” Ms. Martin said, referring to “Jaws,” the 1975 thriller. “People are just wary  —   is the shark going to come up out of the water?” This article is based on interviews around the country with more than three dozen current and recently departed federal employees from the Internal Revenue Service the Pentagon the Environmental Protection Agency the Justice and Treasury Departments the Departments of Homeland Security, Veterans Affairs, and Housing and Urban Development and other parts of the government. They reveal a federal work force that is more fundamentally shaken than usual by the uncertainties that follow a presidential transition from one party to the other. Federal workers are more likely to be Democrats, according to surveys. But partisanship and ideology explain only some of the intense feelings among workers, many of whom have seen Democrats and Republicans in the White House come and go. At bars after work, in employee break rooms, on conference calls and on social media networks, employees at agencies targeted for steep reductions fear for their jobs. They worry about Mr. Trump’s freeze on hiring and regulations, his pledge to reverse environmental protections, and his executive order shutting down immigration for refugees and people from seven predominantly Muslim countries. Some federal workers welcome Mr. Trump’s promises to create new jobs, build infrastructure and lower taxes. Others say they are focusing on doing their jobs and trying not to be distracted by the political noise that surrounds them. Still others say they are struggling with the question of whether they want to work for a president with whom they so strongly disagree. “What do you do,” asked Representative Gerald E. Connolly, Democrat of Virginia, if you work at a place where the leader “avowedly renounces the work of that agency?” “All of a sudden, you are faced with a real moral dilemma,” continued Mr. Connolly, whose district just outside Washington is home to thousands of federal workers. Federal workers watched with growing alarm last year as Mr. Trump waged a campaign filled with antigovernment bombast and then during a transition in which he recruited cabinet secretaries hostile to the agencies they lead. Now they wait in these chaotic early days of Mr. Trump’s presidency as he and his political advisers use executive orders to shred the policies and traditions the workers have championed. The intensity of feeling was already raw in late December, when members of the Digital Service gathered for drinks at the Laughing Man Tavern, a Washington bar, to say goodbye to Mikey Dickerson, their boss and the Google engineer first hired to rescue HealthCare. gov, the government’s Affordable Care Act website. Mr. Dickerson had recruited many of them to overhaul outdated government systems and databases, with the goal of helping President Barack Obama open the country’s doors to refugees, protect immigrants, aid veterans and improve health care. Now, he said, those who choose to stay will be building better tools for the agenda of Mr. Trump. “This is a crisis moment,” Mr. Dickerson told his staff that night, according to a rough transcript of his remarks. “The coalition that brought us all together for a while is broken, because the values that we have all prioritized differently are now pointing in different directions. ” Four days after Mr. Trump’s inauguration, two of Mr. Trump’s advisers  —   Reed Cordish and Chris Liddell  —   attended the Digital Service’s staff meeting. The pair, who are close to Jared Kushner, the president’s    told the nearly 100 staff members that their expertise was valued by the president Mr. Kushner Stephen K. Bannon, the president’s chief strategist and others in the West Wing. The message was meant to provide reassurance. But several members of the team said it had the opposite effect. One employee who still works there said it was the moment she realized their combined technological prowess would be harnessed for a new purpose. “At that moment, when folks heard the name Steve Bannon, it was like a punch in the gut. It became so real,” said the employee, who declined to be identified for fear of reprisals. Career employees are particularly nervous at the E. P. A. which Mr. Trump repeatedly singled out for attack on the campaign trail, vowing at one point to “get rid of” the agency. On Monday, about 100 employees at the agency’s Chicago office, which oversees the enforcement of environmental regulations in five Midwestern states, used their lunch hour to protest the Senate’s confirmation of Scott Pruitt, the Oklahoma attorney general, to lead the agency. Mr. Pruitt was a fierce critic of its mission under Mr. Obama. “I have been through several transitions, but I have never had or seen this level of alarm,” said Nicole Cantello, an E. P. A. lawyer in the Chicago office, who heads the   union of the agency’s employees. Ms. Cantello, who has worked for the E. P. A. prosecuting cases since 1990, said that during the George W. Bush administration, some career employees had quietly bristled at more   environmental regulations. But at no point did they feel the alarm they do now, she said. “Unless there’s an abject abandoning of E. P. A. ’s role in the world, we’ll do what we’re told to do,” she said. In a video to E. P. A. employees this past week, the acting administrator, Catherine R. McCabe, acknowledged that “many of you are concerned about” reports that climate change data had been removed from the department’s websites. “I would like to allay the fears and rumors that scientific data and information are being deleted,” she said. “That is not the case. ” Despite such reassurances, the concerns of federal employees are being spread across social media, on accounts with names like “@Rogue_DOD,” “@Alt_DeptofEd” and “@AngryWHStaffer. ” One anonymous Twitter user created “@WhitehouseLeaks,” with a purported mission to reveal the secret workings of the Trump administration from within the West Wing. Many federal employees recoiled at reports that the president was about to issue an executive order rolling back certain rights for lesbians, gays and transgender people. “There was a group of people who were planning some public display of protest with the purpose of leaving,” a federal employee in Washington said. Another official, who worked at Treasury until this past week, said his friends would have considered that order “the last straw” and most likely would have quit. The president did not issue such an order. Many government employees said they were inspired by the actions of Sally Q. Yates, a top   official in the Justice Department who was fired as  acting attorney general after she refused to order the department’s lawyers to defend the legality of Mr. Trump’s travel ban. More than 1, 000 State Department diplomats registered their opposition to the ban by signing a dissent letter asserting that the new policy would “run counter to core American values” and would not make the country safer. At the Defense Department, where uniformed men and women work with civilians, several    employees expressed outrage that Mr. Trump would announce the travel ban at the Pentagon, a building filled with people from different faiths and countries. That same day, the Defense Department posted a message on Twitter about a former refugee who became a Marine. “From refugee to #Marine. @USMC Cpl Ali J. Mohammed takes his fight to the doorstep of those who cast his family out,” it read.	1

157	Harrison Ford, the actor known for his portrayal of a cocky smuggler and spacecraft pilot in the “Star Wars” movies, mistakenly flew a private plane over a commercial airliner carrying more than 100 people at a California airport on Monday, according to a news report. Mr. Ford, 74, an avid pilot and collector of vintage planes, had been instructed to land on a runway at John Wayne Airport in Santa Ana, Calif. He correctly read back the instructions but landed instead on a taxiway parallel to the runway. In doing so, he flew his plane, a   Aviat Husky, over a 737 that was stopped just ahead of the runway. NBC News, which reported on the episode, said Mr. Ford’s plane flew over an American Airlines jet with 110 passengers and a   crew. It was unclear how far above the airliner he was. NBC reported that Mr. Ford could be heard on   control recordings asking, “Was that airliner meant to be underneath me?” For Mr. Ford, who played Han Solo, the swashbuckling pilot of the Millennium Falcon in the “Star Wars” movies, the errant landing was the second notable episode involving an aircraft he was piloting in nearly two years and the fourth since 1999. On Tuesday, Ian Gregor, a spokesman for the Federal Aviation Administration’s Pacific division, confirmed most details of the episode and said that the agency was investigating it. No one was injured. Mr. Gregor did not confirm that Mr. Ford was piloting the private plane because the agency does not identify people involved in aircraft episodes or accidents. Mr. Gregor, speaking in general, said in an email that pilots who violated agency regulations could face penalties ranging from a warning letter to having their licenses suspended or revoked. Landing on a taxiway is a violation of federal safety rules. United Talent Agency, which represents Mr. Ford, referred inquiries to his publicist, Ina Treciokas, who declined to comment Tuesday night. Mr. Ford is certified as a private pilot and is rated by the F. A. A. to fly several types of aircraft, including a helicopter, according to agency records. He has been inducted into the Living Legends of Aviation and has an honor named after him, the Harrison Ford Aviation Legacy Award. Other episodes involving Mr. Ford and aircraft: • In March 2015, Mr. Ford was injured when a   World War   training plane he was piloting crashed onto a golf course in Venice, Calif. shortly after taking off from Santa Monica Airport. The plane had engine trouble on takeoff, and Mr. Ford was forced to make an emergency landing. He was “banged up” but walked away from the scene, his publicist said at the time. • In June 2000, while landing in Lincoln, Neb. a gust blew Mr. Ford’s plane from the runway. The aircraft, a Beechcraft Bonanza, sustained minor damage, and neither Mr. Ford nor his passenger were injured, AirSafe. com, a website about plane crashes, reported. • In October 1999 in Santa Clarita, Calif. Mr. Ford was on a training flight in a Bell 206 helicopter when he and the instructor made an emergency landing in a dry riverbed, according to AirSafe. com. Neither Mr. Ford nor the instructor were hurt, but the helicopter was substantially damaged.	1
172	WASHINGTON  —   A divided Senate confirmed Representative Mick Mulvaney of South Carolina to be President Trump’s budget director on Thursday, installing in his cabinet a fiscal hawk who will play a central role in the administration’s plans to reshape the federal government. Mr. Mulvaney was confirmed to lead the White House Office of Management and Budget by a vote of 51 to 49, narrowly making the cut over a unified front of Democrats, joined by Senator John McCain of Arizona, the chairman of the Armed Services Committee who accused Mr. Mulvaney of being antimilitary. Mr. McCain was angered by Mr. Mulvaney’s support for firm spending limits on the Defense Department. “I will vote to oppose Congressman Mulvaney’s nomination because it would be irresponsible to place the future of the defense budget in the hands of a person with such a record and judgment on national security,” Mr. McCain said. Mr. Mulvaney enters the job with a busy agenda, because the administration must prepare a budget and address raising the debt limit in the coming weeks. The Trump administration has also promised to roll out a tax plan in short order. Mr. Mulvaney’s views favoring drastic changes to Medicare and raising the eligibility age for Social Security put him at odds with Mr. Trump, who campaigned as the candidate who would protect those popular entitlement programs. Mr. Mulvaney was blamed by Democrats and some Republicans for orchestrating a government shutdown during the Obama era. His stands on spending may also clash with Mr. Trump’s promises of big, new investments in the military and infrastructure.	1

115	Six days after he was sworn in as America’s 45th president, Donald J. Trump traveled to Philadelphia to address Republican lawmakers at their annual retreat. Standing behind a lectern emblazoned with the presidential seal, Trump predicted, “This Congress is going to be the busiest Congress we’ve had in decades. ” Being Trump, he could not resist   a superlative: “Maybe ever. Maybe ever. Think of that. ” The legislators responded with a curious silence  —   perhaps awed by the thought, perhaps also a bit unnerved. After years mired in   the   Congress had both the means and, Trump believed, the mandate to roll back Barack Obama’s liberal legacy. At the top of their hit list was Obama’s monumental health care legislation, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. During the six and a half years since its passage, Republicans maintained a striking unanimity in their hatred of what they derisively called Obamacare. And over that same period, they became thoroughly united in the conviction that Trump expressed from the outset of his candidacy  —   namely, that he “would repeal and replace” the health care law “with something far better. ” But in the months since Trump’s victory, many of the lawmakers in attendance that day had become increasingly worried about how they would go about undoing the legislation. That same weekend in Philadelphia, Republican members of Congress were caught on tape fretting aloud about what the “something far better” to replace the law should be. Should they allow states to accept expanded Medicaid benefits, as Obamacare had done? Should they enter what Representative John Faso, a New York Republican, called the “political minefield” of defunding Planned Parenthood as part of the package? For that matter, should they really be rushing to repeal the A. C. A. before they had any idea of what would replace it? Looming over the gathering was a question that it was perhaps now too late to ask: Had Republicans become trapped by their pledge to do away with Obamacare? A few days before the retreat, I met up with the man who, perhaps more than any other figure in the conservative movement, had maneuvered the party toward complete and unbending opposition to Obamacare: Michael Needham of the Heritage Foundation. Needham, 35, is the chief executive of Heritage Action for America, a feral cur of a lobbying organization established by the venerable conservative think tank in 2010 to (as its website puts it) “hold Congress accountable to conservative principles. ” Though other organizations  —   among them the Club for Growth and Americans for Tax Reform  —   have vigorously opposed Obamacare from its inception, Heritage Action has spent the last six years almost monomaniacally focused on demanding that legislators abolish the hated law. It scores them on what it deems critical votes and loudly condemns any and all apostasies. It names names and, when necessary to its ends, is happy to defy the Republican leadership. In violating Reagan’s “11th Commandment” not to speak ill of others in his party, Needham has come to rival Ted Cruz as one of the least popular Republicans in Washington. Needham would not seem an obvious choice for this distinction.   and passively handsome in the manner of Mitt Romney, he grew up on Manhattan’s Upper East Side. His youthful acquaintance with struggle was limited to being a Mets fan. After graduating from Williams College in 2004, Needham went straight to work for Heritage, where he was made its director of Asian studies, despite having never visited Asia. In 2007 he briefly left the think tank to become a policy aide for the presidential campaign of Rudolph W. Giuliani, the most liberal of the dozen or so Republican candidates in that cycle. By the time Obamacare was signed into law in March 2010, Needham had again temporarily left Heritage, attending Stanford Business School and dating a Democrat whom he would later marry. There was little in the cards to prefigure his imminent future as the    —   and at times deeply reviled  —   lead driver in the Obamacare demolition derby. Like virtually every Republican in Washington, Needham was not especially enamored of Trump during the primaries. “Donald Trump’s a clown,” he said on “Fox News Sunday” just a month after Trump announced his candidacy  —   adding, with evident distaste, “This is a guy who believes in socialized medicine. ” Needham’s preferences ran more to Bobby Jindal, and of course to Cruz, whom Needham reflexively referred to by his first name. Still, Needham and his adopted cause had emerged as unambiguous winners of the 2016 election. On the first day of his presidency, Trump signed an executive order to “seek the prompt repeal” of Obamacare. Thus had Trump and Needham  —   two men who had never met  —   become allies. “I think one of the big disagreements we’ve had with the party for a long time is that we think when you’re trying to win an argument, it can only happen when you start them,” the young C. E. O. said as he sat in his Capitol Hill office, looking somewhat fatigued from having spent the previous weekend   his child. “And this kind of maniacal focus on ‘governing’’u2009”  —   his voice taking on a mocking tone  —   “when all governing means is a   to get good press, instead of laying out a vision of where you want to take the country, was one of the big divides we had. ” But the long, and at times quixotic, struggle to repeal Obamacare in which Needham has been a lead combatant has more closely resembled a street fight than anything that could reasonably be termed an “argument. ” And though it may appear otherwise in a dawning age of Republican   on government, the argument is today far from over. According to a January Fox News poll, Obama’s signature program now enjoys a 50 percent approval rating. There is no guarantee that Republicans in the Senate will sign onto legislation that risks leaving millions of their constituents suddenly without health care coverage while alienating key donors  —   drug makers, insurance companies and doctor associations  —   who helped shape and support the law Trump now seeks to replace. “The joke around Washington,” the former Democratic congressman Jim McDermott told me, “is that the Republicans are going to repeal Obamacare  —   and they’ll replace it with the Affordable Care Act. ” The building that houses the Heritage Foundation, on Massachusetts Avenue near the Capitol, stands as an   monument to   perversity. It was here, in 1989, that the intellectual framework was first developed for what would become the Affordable Care Act. And it is here where Needham has spent the last six years trying to exterminate what he sees as the Frankenstein’s Monster that Heritage inadvertently set loose upon the land. The basic architecture of the bill that would eventually become the A. C. A. was conceived in 1989 by the Heritage Foundation policy analyst Stuart Butler as a conservative alternative to   health care. It was first put into practice in 2006 by Gov. Mitt Romney of Massachusetts, who devised his state’s health care policy with the help of two other Heritage health care specialists, Bob Moffit and Ed Haislmaier. But for many decades, conservatives had resisted increasing the federal government’s role in health care. That remained true in 2009, when the newly elected President Barack Obama undertook to pass legislation that would extend health care coverage to tens of millions of Americans. What Obama and the   Congress ultimately settled on was a framework of health care exchanges  —   marketplaces where health insurance could be purchased, and had to be, if you weren’t already covered. This was the   “individual mandate” first advocated (albeit in the context of a   health care system) by Butler and later embraced by Romney. Obama opposed the concept as a candidate, in favor of an unspecified plan that he claimed would lower costs. What many Democrats on the Hill  —   “probably more than half of our caucus,” McDermott says  —   preferred was a   system, in which health care costs are borne not by insurers but instead by a single fund, typically originating from taxpayers, as Medicare does. But half of the Democratic caucus wasn’t enough for a bill to pass the House, much less the Senate. When a congressional majority failed to materialize for a hybrid measure, known as the “public option,” in which consumers would be allowed to choose among   insurance plans as well as private ones, Democrats were left with the individual mandate. The final   legislative package would aim to “increase the quality, availability and affordability of private and public health insurance to over 44 million uninsured Americans,” as the administration put it. Applicants whose income was between 100 percent and 400 percent of the federal poverty line would be eligible for federally subsidized insurance. Those with incomes at or below 138 percent would now qualify for Medicaid in states that chose to participate in the program. Young people up to the age of 26 were permitted to stay on their parents’ health insurance. Americans with   medical conditions could not be denied coverage. And a variety of other regulations, taxes, penalties and incentives would be set up to maximize participation on the part of insurers, recipients, physicians and health care centers. Though the details of the Affordable Care Act, as the final bill came to be called, left plenty of room for disagreement, its fundamental reliance on   health care overseen by the federal government was a concept anathema to most Republicans. In a   memo written by the Republican pollster Frank Luntz in spring 2009, Republicans were urged to use the phrase “government takeover” when referring to the Democrats’ health care package. Less heeded was another admonition in Luntz’s memo: “It’s not enough to just say what you’re against. You have to tell them what you’re for. ” In the end, Republicans lacked the numbers necessary to block the bill. On March 21, 2010, the House finally passed on a   vote a version of the bill that was sure to be agreed to by the   Senate. “We didn’t give in to mistrust or to cynicism or to fear,” Obama, announcing the bill’s passage that night in the East Room of the White House, said. “Instead, we proved that we are still a people capable of doing big things and tackling our biggest challenges. ” The day after Obama signed the bill into law, a   Republican backbencher from Iowa named Steve King drafted his own bill in the House to repeal it in its entirety. Since there was no hope of Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s considering King’s bill, he had decided to try a rarely successful legislative tactic known as a discharge petition  —   which, if it gathered signatures from 218 of the 435 House members, would force Pelosi to bring King’s bill to the floor for an    vote. A couple of days after King made his move, in   2010, the two newly minted leaders of Heritage Action  —   Needham, then 28, and the   old chief operating officer, Tim Chapman  —   met in the Capitol with Barry Jackson, chief of staff to John Boehner, the House minority leader at the time. Though Jackson today says that he has no recollection of their visit, Needham and Chapman both say they remember it clearly. After explaining the general mission of their new organization, the young conservatives brought up the recently passed Affordable Care Act. Heritage Action, they informed Jackson, intended to push House members to sign King’s petition. Jackson’s response surprised Chapman and Needham. “He was very clear,” Chapman recalls, “that if we pushed forward on it, we would probably not get all the Republicans on it, and it would be politically detrimental to a lot of Republicans to be on it. He said, ‘I’ve seen all the ads the unions have prepared to run on this stuff.’ I don’t know where he’d seen them. We let off on the gas. We said, ‘We’ll agree to disagree on this one.’ It was the ‘aha’ moment for us: We just don’t see the world the same way. ” As both Chapman and Needham today concede, Jackson might also have had his own “aha” moment, recognizing them as impudent young jerks. Still, their aggression had the full blessing of Ed Feulner, then Heritage’s president, who says fondly of Needham, “He reminded me of myself 40 years earlier. ” As for Heritage Action, he said: “We knew we’d be breaking some china. ” Among Republican elected officials, the Heritage Foundation had long been regarded as a tweedy grandfather, revered but not feared. The think tank was proficient at spewing out white papers and keynote speeches. But because of its status as a 501( c)(3) nonprofit, it could not devote a substantial part of its activities to taking positions on congressional votes or campaigning against political foes. Heritage sat by helplessly in 2003 while President George W. Bush, dismaying conservative purists, promoted and then signed into law a new federal entitlement that used Medicare to extend prescription benefits to senior citizens. Two years later, Heritage could do nothing to rescue Bush’s Social Security privatization measure from defeat. Now, with Heritage Action as a 501( c)(4) “social welfare organization,” the foundation at last had its own squad in the fight. And in Needham, Feulner had a   lieutenant whose job, as Feulner put it, would be “to run the flag up the flagpole and see who salutes. ” Steve King’s bill was Heritage Action’s first flag. It had not occurred to Needham and Chapman to see things Barry Jackson’s way  —   to consider that Republicans’ taking an unambiguous stand to completely repeal Obamacare could cost them House seats five months later. Jackson’s hesitancy to campaign on full repeal was in fact shared by many Republican leaders. One of them, Senator John Cornyn, the chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, said of Obamacare in May: “There is noncontroversial stuff here, like the   conditions exclusion and those sorts of things. Now, we are not interested in repealing that. And that is frankly a distraction. ” To Needham, there was only one way to look at the matter. “What’s the point in having a conservative party if we’re not going to fight a massive federal intervention in health care?” he told me. “It’s   of our economy!” Needham and Chapman knew there were risks in allying themselves with King, an inveterate   with a deep yearning for the spotlight. But King was also a tenacious conservative. On June 16, he introduced his discharge petition, and Heritage Action began sending out emails to the foundation’s 661, 000 members, urging them to pressure representatives on both sides of the aisle to sign it  —   ominously adding in a news release that “those who fail to support this effort are responsible for Obamacare. ” The petition soon picked up two highly influential signatories: Representative Tom Price of Georgia, an orthopedic surgeon who was chairman of the Republican Study Committee, the House’s internal conservative think tank and Representative Mike Pence of Indiana, a staunch conservative and personal hero of Needham’s who refused to vote for Bush’s Medicare bill in 2003. A month later, Heritage Action turned up the heat on the 34 Democrats  —   most of them   conservative Blue Dogs  —   who voted against Obamacare in March but had yet to sign King’s discharge petition. In a press statement, Needham declared, “I know their constituents, who will be attending town halls this August, are eager to hear why they do not support the repeal effort. ” In September, a single Democrat, Gene Taylor of Mississippi, added his signature. The tally reached 173, well short of what it would take for King’s bill to make it to the House floor  —   much less to get it passed and then sent over to the Senate, where Republicans’ appetite for abolishing Obamacare altogether was less acute than it was in the House. But though the discharge petition had stalled, King and Heritage Action could justifiably declare a victory of principle and, eventually, an    . Overall, those who pledged fealty to repealing Obamacare fared better that November than those who didn’t. As King told me recently: “The Barry Jacksons and the John Cornyns were clearly wrong. Look at what happened to the Blue Dogs in 2010. There were 53 of them when Obamacare passed. Now I don’t know if you can count three of them. ” King was exaggerating, but not by much  —   there are 18 members of Congress’s Blue Dog Coalition today. “Pelosi made them walk the plank, and they fell like tenpins after that. Since then, I don’t think there’s been a freshman Republican who didn’t run on the full repeal of Obamacare. ” Bashing Obamacare instantly became a winning Republican message  —   an indictment of its polarizing namesake, of   Democrats and of the boogeyman of creeping socialism all rolled into one. During the 2010 midterm election cycle, opponents of the A. C. A. spent $108 million on ads pillorying it. As a reward to the 87 Republican freshmen whose victories had enabled the party to retake the House, Eric Cantor devoted part of his first day as the House majority leader to introducing H. R. 2, the “Repealing the   Health Care Law Act. ” It would become the first of more than 50 bills that would pass the House over the ensuing four years designed to repeal, defund, restrict or delay implementation of Obamacare. None of them stood any chance of becoming a law  —   they were dead on arrival in the   Senate. But to Heritage Action, they served a purpose: in the organization’s parlance, to “lock in” members, to “orient” the Republican Party to conservative principles so that it would “do the right thing. ” At times, however, what looked like the “right thing” was, from Needham’s vantage, in fact the wrong thing. In April 2011, for example, a bill dismantling part of Obamacare did clear the House and then the Senate, and was signed into law by President Obama without hesitation. It was a measure to eliminate the requirement that small companies submit 1099 forms for all transactions exceeding $600, which essentially served as a tax to help pay for the program and which Heritage Action had condemned as “burdensome” and “onerous,” guaranteed to generate paperwork and high accounting fees. But Heritage Action, because of its ironclad resistance to “partial repeal,” actually opposed the measure to get rid of the 1099 provision. Yes, it would help small businesses  —   but then those same small businesses would no longer care to be part of Heritage Action’s crusade. As Needham later told me, “We felt that when anything less than full repeal becomes acceptable, you open the door for every lobbyist in town to say: ‘Hey, while we’re working on full repeal, let’s fix the 1099 issue. Or let’s fix the   issue’’u2009”  —   the popular shorthand for an A. C. A. provision requiring companies with 50 or more employees to provide health care to anyone working over 30 hours a week. “You eventually over time whittle off various constituencies that we want to keep as part of the   platform. ” Partial repeal would be well and good if it got rid of what Needham called a “vital organ” of the law: the individual mandate, say, or Medicaid expansion. But “those vital organs were never going to go down if repeal was defined by Washington’s lobbying class. It would be 1099s and these heavily lobbied issues, and then we’ll be stuck with Obamacare. ” In   Heritage Action declared that it would “key vote,” or place greater emphasis on, bills it deemed especially relevant as litmus tests of members’ conservative bona fides. Needham also began issuing scorecards on how frequently members of Congress were voting down spending bills. The notion of a   former Giuliani aide grading veteran lawmakers on their principles did not go over well. Representative Rob Wittman of Virginia was taken to task in a Heritage Action analysis for casting only four of a potential 11 votes to cut spending during a series of roll calls he had to inform Chapman that he had missed those votes because his father had died. (Chapman did not change Wittman’s score but did explain the reason for Wittman’s absence on the Heritage Action website.) Representative Geoff Davis of Kentucky, a onetime target of Heritage Action’s grading system, fumed to me about the organization’s absolutist browbeating, which came as Republican members were doing their best to thwart Obama’s agenda. “If I’m trying to stop someone’s bleeding on the side of the road, I don’t need to also give them a lecture about how they need to do aerobics and lift weights three times a week,” he said. Echoing the opinion of many Republicans in Washington, Davis asserted that Needham’s operation was less about legislative results than its own  : “Very quickly, it became a conservative   operation,” he said. More than once, Chapman recalls, Republican leaders on the Hill called Feulner to say, “You’ve got to rein these guys in. ” But Heritage Action had other defenders besides Feulner. The new Republican Study Committee chairman, Jim Jordan of Ohio, felt that Needham’s organization was instrumental in pushing the party rightward. Mick Mulvaney of South Carolina, a rising star in the Tea Party class of 2010, characterized Heritage Action’s messaging as “invaluable. ” Even the complaints were tacit acknowledgments of the organization’s growing clout. As a 501( c)(4) Heritage Action was not obliged to disclose its finances, but it was known to have received millions, including $500, 000 from the Koch brothers.     House members pointed with pride to their high Heritage Action scores. Leadership aides saw no choice but to include Needham and Chapman in strategy meetings. And Heritage Action’s relentless focus on its message  —   Obamacare is a disaster that must be repealed in full  —   was already taking its toll. Before the law had even gone fully into effect, polls consistently showed that most Americans disapproved of it. The A. C. A. ’s unpopularity persisted despite a number of modifications meant to improve the program and thus quell discontent. As Kathleen Sebelius, the Health and Human Services secretary at the time, told me: “The notion from Day 1 was to make this work and listen carefully to the feedback, and to help dampen anxiety without gutting key provisions in the law. What made things difficult was that most of the law wasn’t going to be implemented right away. There was this huge gap in time between designing the bill and actually having the benefits fully in place, which gave a lot of opportunity for the opposition to say, ‘This will kill jobs, pestilence will come, vermin will fall from the sky’  —   and very little opportunity for us to say anything other than, ‘Wait and see. ’’u2009” On this point, if nothing else, Sebelius and Needham could agree: The war on Obamacare would become far more difficult for opponents to wage once the actual benefits became available. New enrollees would begin receiving health care coverage on Jan. 1, 2014. It was a glum axiom among conservatives that once Americans were handed a new entitlement  —   Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, food stamps, unemployment insurance  —   they were loath to part with it. Moreover, once a gigantic program fully insinuates itself into the federal governing apparatus, disentangling it is a formidable task. “One of my political heroes in town is Don Rumsfeld,” Feulner told me. “And one of Rumsfeld’s rules is that you want to act as quickly and aggressively as you can, because every day someone in the bureaucracy is narrowing the options you’ll have two days later. That’s clearly what’s happening with Obamacare. Every day the options for full repeal get fewer and fewer. ” On Sept. 24, 2013, House Republicans, goaded by Heritage Action and Ted Cruz, drafted legislation in which they agreed to raise the debt ceiling if Obama agreed to a number of conditions, including delaying implementation of his health care law by one year. Senate Democrats objected, but House Republicans wouldn’t budge. As a consequence, the United States Treasury warned it would soon default on its obligations, and on Oct. 1 the government began shutting down. A couple of days later, Tim Chapman met with several senior Republican staff members and members of conservative activist groups in a House conference room. The shutdown was the crisis point Heritage Action had hoped for  —   that cherished moment when Republicans finally took a bold, principled stand. The public would express outrage that the president was willing to hold America’s full faith and credit hostage over the   Obamacare. Democrats would go wobbly. Republicans in both the House and the Senate would stand firm. In the end, Obama would cave. Or so Needham and Chapman hoped. “Kudos to leadership for doing the right thing,” Chapman told the group. “Now let’s prosecute this case!” His enthusiasm was met with a wall of silence. The others in the room stared at him with a welling resentment. Finally, a   analyst at Americans for Tax Reform said to Chapman: “You’ve been saying the Republicans need to be brave. Well, we’re doing that. We’ve shut the government down. But what does Heritage Action intend to do to put pressure on the Democrats? So far, the only money you’ve spent over the past few months has been a   dollars attacking Republicans. ” Chapman went visibly  . Only a couple of days into the shutdown, it was now occurring to the chief operating officer of Heritage Action that he and Needham had been abandoned by conservative leaders. Within days, the Republicans in the Senate buckled and, with the House Republican leaders in tow, signed a   deal with Obama that said almost nothing about health care. Congress was blamed by the public for causing the shutdown, and its approval ratings plummeted. Throughout the shutdown, Needham insisted that the public would eventually reward Republicans for standing up to Obamacare. “Look,” he told me at the time, “there’s more Americans who are aware right now of the fact that we have one political party that owns Obamacare and was willing to go to the great lengths of shutting down the World War II Memorial in order to preserve it, and another party that tried to stop it. And Americans deserve that type of clarity. ” This opinion was apparently not shared by Speaker Boehner. In December 2013, he told reporters that groups like Heritage Action had “lost all credibility. ” A month later, on the “Tonight” show, he called the government shutdown a “predictable disaster. ” But the continuing intransigence of the repeal advocates was beginning to wear down the White House. Initially, Sebelius says, “we were more focused on the Republican attorneys general across the country who challenged the constitutionality of the law. Until that was resolved by the Supreme Court in June 2012, that was our focus. The congressional action was viewed more as sour grapes and not altogether realistic. Clearly the president wasn’t going to sign anything that would strike down his   law. ” By the time of the shutdown, though, the repealers appeared to have succeeded in getting inside the Obama administration’s collective head. As Oct. 1, 2013  —   the date HealthCare. gov was to be open for enrollments  —   approached, little time was available to subject the website to tests that could expose its shortcomings. But “the one thing that wasn’t feasible, knowing how vehemently the Republicans were determined to stop it at any cost, was moving the deadline,” she said. “That would have mobilized the opposition to the point that we might never have been able to launch it at all. ” And so the White House rolled out a deeply flawed website. By this time, the Republican critique of Obamacare was already becoming a   prophecy. The A. C. A. had been passed with only about   of the funding that it would need to be fully operational, with the expectation that the rest would be portioned out by Congress annually, through the appropriations process that funds discretionary government programs. From 2011 through 2014, as the House Republicans played round after round of fiscal brinkmanship, Obama reluctantly signed   budget deals that continually shortchanged Obamacare. “They did a very effective job making sure there would never be enough to fund implementation,” Sebelius told me. “And they came after the budget over and over. Anything that looked like it could be used, they made sure was gone. ” That was especially the case, Sebelius said, when it came to educating the public about the program’s benefits  —   funding that would have made a difference in the 19 states where governors and legislatures had refused to expand Medicaid and had no interest in promoting Obamacare. “Any effort to put in dollars for outreach on the federal level,” she said, “were immediately stripped out. ” It’s impossible to know for sure how much of a role the hobbling of Obamacare played in the outcome of the 2014 midterm elections, in which the Republicans captured the Senate and expanded their majority in the House. But Republicans uniformly campaigned against the program, while Democrats found themselves at pains to demonstrate its virtues. As a bonus for Needham and Chapman, Eric Cantor, the House majority leader had been drubbed in the primary by a Tea   Republican. In September 2015, Boehner would step down as well. A month after Boehner resigned, the House considered yet another bill targeting Obamacare. But this one was different from its predecessors. Sponsored by Representative Tom Price, who in just over a year would be Trump’s pick as secretary of Health and Human Services, H. R. 3762 was a “reconciliation bill,” a budgetary measure to defund the health care program that would, in accordance with Senate rules, require only 51 votes to pass in the upper chamber. That threshold was attainable, now that the Republicans had 54 Senate seats. The bigger hurdle was a more arcane one: To qualify for this lower passage threshold as a reconciliation bill, every item in the legislation had to be deemed a budgetary fix, rather than an extraneous provision, by the Senate parliamentarian. Accordingly, it did not include repealing the individual mandate and Medicaid expansion. Better to let the Senate legislative aides confer on those matters with the parliamentarian, one staff member who helped write the bill told me. That approach was not good enough for Needham and Chapman. Heritage Action announced its strong disapproval of the reconciliation bill, instructed members to vote it down and warned that the measure would be  . Insisting that it was “universally acknowledged” that the repeal of the exchange subsidies and Medicaid expansion would qualify as reconcilable items, Heritage Action stated that it would be satisfied with nothing less. The new speaker of the House, Paul Ryan, ignored Heritage Action. On Oct. 23, the reconciliation bill went to the House floor, where all but seven Republicans voted for it. Apoplectic, Needham termed the act a “charade” that “undermines the party’s longstanding position of full repeal. ” He added, “We expect the Senate to do better. ” The Senate Republicans did. Their version of the bill included repeal of the individual mandate and Medicaid expansion. The parliamentarian ruled that both provisions were extraneous and did not therefore qualify in their present form for a   vote. A   version of the bill, which kept the individual mandate and Medicaid expansion but stripped away the ability to enforce either, then passed the Senate and was reapproved by the House. It was sent over to President Obama. On Jan. 8, 2016, he vetoed it. Obama’s final defense of his namesake program would come almost exactly 10 months later, when he received   Trump in the Oval Office and urged him not to eviscerate Obamacare. Obama’s words, Trump said the following day to The Wall Street Journal, had made him reconsider abolishing the law in full. But 10 weeks later, as one of the very first acts of his presidency, Trump signed an executive order whose mission statement was the “prompt repeal” of Obamacare in its entirety. The Affordable Care Act’s approval rating has rarely exceeded 50 percent. And over time, as it has strained under the multitude of compromises that were necessary for its passage, it has proved itself worthy of several of the criticisms aimed at it. Though for 80 percent of health care recipients (including those receiving health care from Medicare, Medicaid or their employers) annual rate increases are at historic lows, for the rest the story has been different. The premiums have been rising because of a variety of structural reasons, and because federal assistance to recipients to offset the costs has been in many cases inadequate. Or, as the   analyst Robert Laszewski puts it, “They created a Cadillac with Chevrolet subsidies. ” But it is also because unit costs have continued to soar  —   like the price of prescription drugs, thanks to the sweetheart deal that the pharmaceutical industry cut with the Democrats in exchange for being an early supporter of the law. Some rural states like Alaska have seen very little competition among insurers  —   something that a public option might have addressed, had the insurance lobby not spent a fortune to defeat that provision. Of the 23 nonprofit insurance   set up by the Affordable Care Act to compete in such areas, only a handful remain  —   probably at least in part because the   received from Congress only $2. 4 billion of the $6 billion originally appropriated to establish them. To make Obamacare economically feasible for insurers, the program needed to attract a large pool of young and healthy recipients to offset the costs of providing care for the older and less healthy. That ratio has yet to prove satisfactory for many insurance companies  —   one of which, Aetna, announced last year that it would be abandoning the program in several states. (Aetna publicly blamed Obamacare, saying that it was losing money participating in the exchanges, but a federal judge ruled that Aetna’s real motive was to escape scrutiny for its possibly illegal merger with Humana, and court documents have shown that the company was making money in some states where it was claiming not to.) Then again, it was always the industry’s expectation that the law would prove flawed in places, and that those shortcomings would be addressed legislatively. As Karen Ignagni, the lead lobbyist for the   industry during the formation and passage of Obamacare and now president and C. E. O. of EmblemHealth, tactfully puts it: “On the Affordable Care Act, there was a strong difference of opinion between Democrats and Republicans going back to the initial days of discussion. And so there was never a  . ” In spite of all this, Obamacare has done far more good than its critics predicted it would. As of 2014, insurers cannot deny coverage to anyone based on their current health status  —   a meaningful protection for the 133 million Americans with chronic illnesses. Over 15 million poor or   citizens are now receiving Medicaid benefits in the 31 states (as well as the District of Columbia) that have opted for this expansion. Another 3 million Americans under the age of 26 have been allowed to stay on their parents’ health care plans, thanks to the provision in the A. C. A. that Heritage Action warmly refers to as the “slacker mandate. ” Meanwhile, during each month that Obamacare has been in existence, the private sector has grown. The bill has not proved to be the “job killer” apocalyptically described by its Republican opponents. Now that the law is in place, trying to tinker with it in a measured fashion, deciding which parts to discard and which to keep, would be more complicated than simply determining what the public likes and what it doesn’t. As Jim McDermott says: “You can’t just reach in and pull out one thing. It’d be like a doctor doing surgery and saying, ‘Well, since you’re not using your spleen today, let’s take it out.’ It’s all wired together in a very complex way. ” That wiring represents, among other things, the compromises worked out with the various players in the health care ecosystem  —   doctors’ and nurses’ associations, hospital groups, insurers, drug companies  —   that enabled the passage of Obamacare in the first place. As Ignagni points out: “It was very unique that all of the different industries were willing to sit at the table and engage in   together. I don’t really recall any time when that has happened in our economy on any issue. ” Collectively, those groups spent close to $273 million on lobbying during the height of the Obamacare debate. They will surely spend a similar sum haranguing Congress to pass a replacement that favors them. Many conservative remedies have been floated over the years and have been consolidated into Speaker Paul Ryan’s   “A Better Way” summation: expanded health savings accounts, assorted tax credits and refunds,   reform, portability of insurance from one job to the next and the ability to purchase insurance across state lines. But the problem for Republicans is that Obamacare’s sweeping coverage has changed the paradigm. Of the 31 states that have opted for expanded Medicaid coverage, 16 have Republican governors. None of these governors have expressed a desire to throw their states’ residents off the rolls. At the same time, the fitful and at times rhetorically muddled transition from the known (Obamacare) to the unknown (“something terrific”) has risked throwing the health care industry into turmoil. The aftershocks are likely to be not only economic but also political. “If you take Obamacare as it looks right now,” says the policy analyst Robert Laszewski, a longtime critic of the legislation, about half of enrollees “don’t get a subsidy because their incomes are too high. They make $90, 000 or $100, 000 a year but are in the individual market. These tend to be Trump supporters. So if he further destabilizes this thing and there are     rate increases, he’ll be screwing his own people. ” Last month, Representative Steve King once again offered his   legislation, maintaining that in doing away with Obamacare, the country would immediately be “far better off,” even if nothing were done to replace it. To King and Heritage Action, failing to seize this moment of opportunity would constitute a grave betrayal. “It’s pretty clear that the conservative base is expecting Congress to do this,” Chapman told me. “If Congress goes back to the voters in 2018 and people are still enrolling in Obamacare, I think that’s going to be disastrous. ” Speaking of the base, Chapman predicted, “They’re basically going to splinter off and create a third party. ” But it took more than the conservative base to elect Donald Trump, and it will take more than them to   many Republican senators and representatives in 2018 and 2020. The rest of the public has begun a decided turn against King’s and Heritage Action’s position. The same Fox News poll last month that found Obamacare’s overall favorability to be 50 percent also found that only 23 percent of respondents favored fully repealing it  —   a new low since the law was signed nearly seven years ago. After Trump remarked to The Washington Post on Jan. 15 that he planned to provide “insurance for everybody,” I thought I had better gauge Michael Needham’s reaction. Taken at face value, Trump did not sound much like a man hellbent on tilting health care policy rightward. “I’m concerned when I hear that kind of talk,” King had told me. “I don’t know how deeply he’s gone into the details. ” But Needham chuckled breezily when I brought up Trump’s statement. “I think right now there’s a lot of people who want to jump on words,” he said. “Everybody wants to ensure every American has access to   health care. That is pretty clearly what Trump was saying. What’s the overused phrase? Trump supporters take him seriously, not literally. ” Nor did it seem to bother him that Republicans on the Hill were in a frenzy to develop a consensus for replacement legislation. Up to now, Needham reminded me, the goal had been to inculcate in the party a ceaseless lust for Obamacare repeal. “For the last eight years,” he said, “it hasn’t made sense to litigate the nuance of, Do you use a tax credit or a tax deduction, or what are your views of  ?” The Republicans might not end up with a single gargantuan replacement bill, and maybe that was as it should be. “We’re probably in an age where smaller, humbler pieces of legislation are easier to get consensus around. ” This struck me as sensible and, at the same time, somewhat naïve. If, as in Heritage Action’s dream scenario, Obamacare were to be immediately vaporized, it would leave a yawning vacuum  —   and the first thing to fill it would be anxiety. Every gruesome case of   families now left to die would be duly chronicled by the media. Legislators would panic  —   but, if recent history is any judge, their reaction would be tame compared with that of the man who now thoroughly owned the   landscape. Was it really so hard, I asked Needham, to imagine Trump faltering under the specter of bad press and equally bad approval ratings and hastily offering up a Trumpcare that bore a suspicious resemblance to Obamacare? Needham paused for a moment before saying, in a vaguely amazed voice: “I’m a little surprised by the question. Right now, I don’t see much evidence of that playing out. ” Trump’s vice president was Mike Pence, “my first hero when I came to Washington. ” Tom Price, the nominee for Health and Human Services secretary, and Mick Mulvaney, whom Trump tapped to run the Office of Management and Budget, were longtime supporters of Heritage Action. The former senator Jim DeMint, Ed Feulner’s replacement as president of the Heritage Foundation, was helping to shape the selection of Trump’s prospective Supreme Court nominees. Trump’s team was loaded with Heritage staff members. All this counted for as much as whatever the new president himself thought. “Richard Viguerie, one of the icons of the conservative movement, said to me that what was great about Reagan was that when he walked into the room, you saw your friends and allies walking with him,” Needham told me. It was a pleasing image, conveying undying fellowship. Yet even Reagan, fierce inveigher against socialized medicine that he was, did not make a dent in Medicare, the program he so loathed, during his two terms in office. Quite the contrary, in fact: He briefly expanded its benefits to include catastrophic care for the elderly before Congress struck down the measure less than a year after Reagan left office. Now came the president whom Needham once accused of embracing socialized medicine. Maybe he would somehow turn out to be a more reliable friend to the conservative movement than Reagan had been.

376	While Ellen Milz and her family were watching the Olympics last summer, their TV was watching them. Ms. Milz, 48, who lives with her husband and three children in Chicago, had agreed to be a panelist for a company called TVision Insights, which monitored her viewing habits  —   and whether her eyes flicked down to her phone during the commercials, whether she was smiling or frowning  —   through a device on top of her TV. “The marketing company said, ‘We’re going to ask you to put this device in your home, connect it to your TV and they’re going to watch you for the Olympics to see how you like it, what sports, your expression, who’s around,’” she said. “And I said, ‘Whatever, I have nothing to hide. ’” Ms. Milz acknowledged that she had initially found the idea odd, but that those qualms had quickly faded. “It’s out of sight, out of mind,” she said, comparing it to the Nest security cameras in her home. She said she had initially received $60 for participating and an additional $230 after four to six months. TVision  —   which has worked with the Weather Channel, NBC and the Disney ABC Television Group  —   is one of several companies that have entered living rooms in recent years, emerging with new, granular ways for marketers to understand how people are watching television and, in particular, commercials. The appeal of this information has soared as Americans rapidly change their viewing habits, streaming an increasing number of shows weeks or months after they first air, on devices as varied as smartphones, laptops and Roku boxes, not to mention TVs. Through the installation of a Microsoft Kinect device, normally used for Xbox video games, on top of participants’ TVs, TVision tracks the movement of people’s eyes in relation to the television. The device’s sensors can record minute shifts for all the people in the room. The company then matches those viewing patterns to shows and commercials using technology that listens to what is being broadcast on the TV. “The big thing for TV advertisers and the networks is: Are you actually looking at the screen or not?” said Dan Schiffman, the chief revenue officer of TVision (pronounced  ). “What you looked at is interesting, but the fact that you looked away is arguably the most interesting. ” Mr. Schiffman founded TVision, a     with a classmate from the Sloan School of Management at M. I. T. Companies spend around $69 billion a year on TV ads in the United States and are keen to find out how to best distribute that money in a fractured media landscape. Nielsen and its panel of 42, 500 households have long determined how money is spent on TV advertising in the United States. The higher a show’s ratings, the more networks can charge for advertising. But some industry executives have criticized Nielsen’s methods as outdated. Nielsen selects homes at random to represent the nation’s viewing audience, and measures who is watching what shows, mostly through meters connected to the sets, as well as diaries in select markets and digital tracking of certain   programs on tablets and phones. The company recently delayed the rollout of a new system that will count viewing across platforms and devices. The capability to do just that is a core selling point for upstarts like TVision, which promote their ability to measure how people are   shows on, say, Netflix and Amazon. “Nielsen will remain the currency for the time being because it is agreed upon as the thing everyone uses,” said Alan Wurtzel, an adviser at NBCUniversal and its former head of research. “But as the world becomes more complex, as it is, many more additional supplemental or complementary measures will come into play. ” Information gathered by companies like TVision can help advertisers steer marketing toward shows with the most engaged audiences, not just the largest ones. And for networks, it could make a show with a committed and loyal audience as valuable as one that attracts a larger but more casual set of viewers. TVision has recruited 2, 000 households, or roughly 7, 500 people, in the Boston, Chicago and   Worth areas. The company said the information was transmitted without storing images or video and collected anonymously. Mr. Schiffman said the data would show, for example, “Person No. 124 in Household 6 was paying attention this second and not paying attention the next to a certain program or advertisement. ” Symphony Advanced Media has built a panel of 17, 500 people in the United States who have installed its Media Insiders mobile app, mostly on Android phones. In exchange for about $5 to $12 a month, the app passively tracks how people use their phones, uses the device’s microphone to hear what they are watching and asks them to complete surveys. The app can tell if someone streamed a show using headphones while on a bus or saw a commercial at a sports bar. Symphony and TVision both use technology that can recognize shows and ads through the audio or digital tags the content contains. Consumers are most likely familiar with this type of technology through the   app Shazam. Another ratings company, RealityMine, has assembled a panel of 5, 000 people in the United States whom it said it paid less than $90 a year, who either have its app, a “home meter” plugged into their internet networks or both. In some instances, its meter may capture activity across 25 devices in a household, such as tablet, phone, Xbox, Wii, Apple TV and Google Chromecast. The aim is “understanding what is the media day and the life of the consumer today,” said Charlie Buchwalter, the chief executive of Symphony, which has worked with companies including NBCUniversal. Mr. Schiffman said that while some people were wary of TVision’s technology, they were often placated after learning that it was not storing images or videos. During the Olympics, Ms. Milz wore a Fitbit so that NBC could see how her heart rate changed while she watched certain events. “We’re just trying to understand where people really are and what they’re doing, what they’re watching, how are they interacting, and ideally after that, how is that changing their behavior or affecting their behavior,” said Jonathan Steuer, the chief research officer of Omnicom Media Group, which oversees media buying for advertisers. Still, privacy can be a concern. This month, Vizio, one of the biggest makers of   televisions, said it would pay $2. 2 million to settle charges that it had been collecting and selling viewing data from millions of smart TVs without the knowledge or consent of the sets’ owners. By measuring the level of attention a person is paying to a given show, TVision believes it can help bolster niche programs and smaller networks. For example, Mr. Schiffman said the company had found that the series “Lucifer,” on Fox, commanded better attention metrics from viewers than “The Big Bang Theory,” on CBS, even though “Big Bang” is one of the TV shows rated highest by Nielsen. “People don’t just tune into ‘Lucifer.’ They DVR it and watch it when they come home,” he said, adding that viewers tend to be focused on the show and stay in the room when it is on. The Weather Channel used TVision’s data in the fall to give it an edge over the news and lifestyle shows it is normally compared against by advertisers. It showed its audience for weather news as “lean forward,   viewers,” said Indira Venkat, who oversees research at the channel. “What is oftentimes missing is the quality of the audience,” Ms. Venkat said about Nielsen viewing data. “Yes, you’re getting audience, but what are they doing in today’s era of multitasking?”	1
895	 Last year in a Kansas City speech, President Obama said he received a letter from a young girl asking why there were no women on American currency.“And then she gave me like a long list of possible women to put on our dollar bills and quarters and stuff, which I thought was a pretty good idea,” the president said.Now, the Obama administration is following through on that idea. The Treasury Department has announced that it’s redesigning the $10 bill to feature First Lady Michelle Obama“Our democracy is a work in progress. We’ve always been committed to a more perfect union,” Treasury Secretary Jack Lew told reporters Wednesday. “This decision to put the first lady on the $10 reflects our aspirations for the future, as much as it is a reflection of the past.” The law prohibits portraits of living persons from appearing on Government Securities. Therefore, the portraits on our currency notes are of deceased persons whose places in history the American people know well.	0
151	Watching male and female models stride down the runways in tandem as more designers combined their women’s and men’s collections this New York Fashion Week raised the questions of what is masculine and what is feminine, how much those distinctions matter, and who gets to decide. Depending on which show you viewed, it’s fine for men to sport blue feather boas or fishnet shirts with a bow (Jeremy Scott). Or for women and men to wear virtually interchangeable clothes, in restrained, minimalist androgyny (Raf Simons for Calvin Klein). Or for women to feminize the puffer by wearing it off the shoulder, cinched at the waist (Public School). Society is in a time of renewed ferment about gender. Culture wars rage over bathrooms and even the very notion that men or women have to choose one fixed gender identity. President Donald J. Trump reportedly likes his female staff “to dress like women” just what this means isn’t entirely clear. The divide looms between those who welcome the new fluidity and those who yearn for clearly defined gender roles. So designers on the runway this week engaged in a continuing dialogue about how clothing defines masculinity and femininity  —   and how it scrambles these notions, too. Fashion has crossed many of these lines for years, of course. Women have long appropriated men’s clothes for comfort and authority. In the 1960s, longhaired men in paisley, florals and   defied conventions of what men were supposed to look like and what clothes they were supposed to wear. Jean Paul Gaultier put a man in a skirt back in 1984. And last year, Jaden Smith wore clothes designed for women in a Louis Vuitton advertisement. But showing the women’s and men’s lines together allowed for   consideration of what the differences were, really. Material? Designers used the same fabrics for many of the men’s and women’s collections. Cut? In some cases, the tailoring seemed uncannily similar. Accessories? Many designers included accessories that once would have been thought exclusively feminine or masculine on both male and female models. Fashion, like society, is clearly not opting for hard and fast rules. Yet each designer brought a particular sensibility to the gender continuum. Raf Simons made his name in men’s wear before expanding to women’s clothing. His first collection for Calvin Klein was also the first time the house showed both men’s and women’s lines in the same show. Mr. Simons was known for a distinctive male model, skinny and less bulked up, and he has said he designed some of his distinctive   suits for that physique. In this show, much of the men’s and women’s clothing looked all but identical there were a few times when it was hard to figure out whether the model was a man or a woman. There were glen plaid suits with   blazers and black leather jackets with silver rose cutouts for men and women. The   pants and varsity stripe motifs were echoed in the men’s and women’s clothes. Mr. Simons played with the idea of transparency: women in sheer tops showing nipples men in sheer tops showing theirs. But he did not overtly cross gender lines by putting men in skirts. And he showed some simply beautiful feminine clothes, such as the dresses made of feathers encased in sheer plastic. For Public School, the designers   Chow and Maxwell Osborne took street motifs often associated with men  —   parkas, puffers, hoodies, anoraks  —   and toyed with how to dress women in them. The    puffers for women were a surprisingly sensual look for a normally unisex coat the men in the show wore the puffers short, not big or baggy. As with the other runway shows, combining men and women allowed the designers to present one aesthetic and show how it applied to each gender. At Public School, a man walked out in a plaid shirt and slightly baggy pants with a zipper, followed by a woman wearing the same plaid shirt as a dress with a navy train. A man wore an oversize glen paid top a woman wore the same glen plaid ensemble but belted and draped more closely to her body. Generally, the men’s and women’s looks were not interchangeable rather, men were in recognizable men’s clothes, and women were more often in dresses and skirts, with bare shoulders and material gathered in artful folds. It was a brasher vision than Calvin Klein’s, further along the continuum of sexual distinction. Jeremy Scott had it both ways: gender traditional in his unabashed sexuality for women and nonconforming in his use of what were once thought of as feminine colors, styles and accessories for men. Many of his designs for women were sex kittenish, including baby doll dresses, fishnet stockings,   boots, short shorts in pink knit, and clingy tops in silver lamé. Men wore styles and colors that used to be associated with femininity: clingy velour pants in fuchsia and purple or jackets with gold fringe and purple sleeves. And sometimes Mr. Scott drew inspiration from both tropes in one look: He sent out a male model in a plaid skirt worn like a tunic over ripped jeans, finished off with an oversize parka. Men and women wore his signature Jesus motif coats with leopard accents  —   the women’s coats tighter, the men’s looser. In the end, designers ran the gamut, from blurring the lines between men and women to embracing them, sometimes in the same collection. It may be that fashion’s refusal to decide, to render any one verdict, is as radical as some of the more overtly political statements made this week on the runways.	1
279	BEIJING  —   For years, the United States and others have pressed China’s leaders to suspend imports of coal from North Korea to push the reclusive state to abandon its nuclear weapons program. For years, the Chinese leadership resisted  —   until Saturday, when it suddenly announced in a terse statement that it would do just that. But if Beijing was sending a message to North Korea, it was also directing one at President Trump, who has complained that China was not putting enough pressure on North Korea. Now President Xi Jinping of China has essentially said: We have done our part in enforcing sanctions. Over to you, Mr. Trump. The challenge comes at a tantalizing moment. For weeks now, plans have been afoot for a North Korean government delegation to meet in New York in early March with a group of former United States officials who have long been involved in North Korea policy. Will the Trump administration issue visas to the North Koreans, a move that would suggest the new president is interested at least in hearing from Pyongyang through informal channels? There have been indications that Mr. Trump was willing to take a quite different tack from President Barack Obama. During his campaign, Mr. Trump said he was interested in sharing a hamburger with the    leader of North Korea, Kim  . He seemed to suggest he had a smidgen of respect for, or at least curiosity about, the maverick leader, the most recent incarnation of a longstanding dynasty. Mr. Trump’s response to the recent North Korean missile test was restrained, perhaps the result of Mr. Obama’s warning after the November election that North Korea would be the incoming president’s most dangerous foreign policy challenge. “If the visas are issued, it will be a clear message that the Trump administration is prepared to go the extra mile and engage North Korea,” said Evans J. R. Revere, a former principal deputy assistant secretary of state. There should be little expectation, he warned, of any policy shift by the North, which has shown every indication of wanting to continue building its nuclear program. The planned meeting, sponsored by the National Committee on American Foreign Policy, headed by Donald S. Zagoria, falls far short of talks between the two governments and has been designed as an initial sounding board. “I have been organizing such meetings with the North Koreans since 2003, and our goal is to increase mutual understanding as well as to encourage the kind of frank dialogue that may not be possible in official talks,” Mr. Zagoria said. The gathering would be the first of its type in New York in five years because the Obama administration opposed holding even informal talks on American soil given North Korea’s expansion of its nuclear weapons program. That North Korea is holding two Americans hostage was another impediment. Meetings with North Korean officials arranged by Mr. Zagoria and other groups were held in world capitals during the Obama era, including Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, and Berlin last year. The decision whether to allow the meeting to proceed in New York is now freighted with more than the usual complications. Over the last 10 days, North Korea has shown its full colors. First, the regime flaunted its expanding nuclear capabilities with the test of an   ballistic missile that uses a   technology that will make it easier for the country to hide its arsenal. Then, last week, Kim   the half brother of the North Korean leader, was assassinated in Malaysia in a crowded passenger terminal at Kuala Lumpur International Airport. The South Korean government has publicly accused North Korea of the killing, and six North Koreans have been linked to the plot. Without these two incidents, the Trump administration could have won praise for breaking the logjam with North Korea by allowing the New York meeting to go ahead, said a former participant in such meetings who declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the topic. But the assassination of Kim   would allow opponents of North Korean engagement to charge that granting visas only rewarded bad behavior, the person said. Soon after the killing, Republican and Democratic members of Congress called for the United States to return North Korea to its blacklist of states that sponsor terrorism, from which it was removed nine years ago. The Trump administration faces another, perhaps more profound, decision on how to handle North Korea. Annual joint military exercises, set for March between South Korea and the United States, are expected to involve an American aircraft carrier, advanced stealth fighters,   and   bombers and a nuclear submarine, according to South Korean news reports. This annual show of force, not far from the demilitarized zone between North and South Korea and off the Korean coast, has traditionally been viewed by North Korea as an American preparation for an attack against its forces. With the heightened tensions on the Korean Peninsula, and   Korean relations at a low point, the risk of a strong response by the North to the exercises  —   through the launch of missiles or a nuclear test  —   is higher than usual, said Peter Hayes, the executive director of the Nautilus Institute for Security and Sustainability in Berkeley, Calif. Last year, for example, the North conducted  its fifth nuclear test during joint   Korean military exercises. “We are likely entering a new and extremely dangerous phase of the Korean conflict,” Mr. Hayes said. He suggested ramping down the exercises to “avoid inadvertent clashes and escalation to nuclear war, and to probe North Korean intentions. ” China would like the Trump administration to deal directly with North Korea. Beijing’s suspension of coal imports from North Korea was a signal that China was being tougher than usual, offering Mr. Trump a concession to bring Washington to the table with the North. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has stepped up his contacts with Chinese officials in recent days. On Tuesday he spoke by telephone with Yang Jiechi, China’s top diplomat, and among the topics they discussed was how to handle North Korea. But how much impact a suspension of coal imports would have on the rudimentary and seemingly resilient North Korean economy was far from clear. The Foreign Ministry insisted Tuesday that the suspension of coal imports was a bureaucratic procedure. In the first six weeks of 2017 China had already imported almost all its annual quota of coal allowed under the United Nations sanctions, the ministry said. Zhang Liangui, an expert on North Korea at the Central Party School of the Communist Party, said he was not optimistic that any talks with North Korea, formal or informal, would result in a diminishing of the North’s nuclear capabilities. “North Korea has said more than 50 times that it will not participate in any talks that have denuclearization on the agenda,” he said. “I don’t think President Trump could pull this off and talk the Koreans out of it. ”	1
311	CANNON BALL, N. D.  —   The fires burned for hours on the flat, muddy landscape, their thick smoke rising through snowflakes that tumbled to the ground. Someone rode a snowmobile across the dirt, and others moved their belongings to the side of a rural highway. The police gathered, prepared to follow the governor’s order to clear people from this rural part of the state. But the Wednesday afternoon deadline for protesters of the Dakota Access oil pipeline to empty their largest encampment passed with far more uncertainty than unrest. In the hours after the deadline, the authorities made 10 arrests but said they would not fully empty the camp on Wednesday night. Roughly 25 to 50 demonstrators were believed to remain in the mandatory evacuation zone, said Gov. Doug Burgum, who said cleaning crews planned to enter the camp Thursday morning. “Anyone who obstructs our ability to do cleanup will be subject to arrest,” Mr. Burgum said. The scene here, about an hour’s drive south of Bismarck, the state capital, seemed to represent a muffled end to a specific and passionate protest that drew thousands of demonstrators and became central to the national debate about energy, the environment and the rights of Native Americans. Protesters argued that the nearly completed pipeline, now moving ahead with the support of President Trump’s administration, could imperil the drinking water supply on the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation. “We won,” said Vanessa Red Bull, 54, who has spent months here. “We slowed that pipeline down months and months and months. We cost them who knows how much money. And we slowed them down. ” She added, “This has been a multilayered event that has brought attention to glaring issues. ” Ms. Red Bull and her allies won a brief victory last year, when the Army Corps of Engineers said in the waning days of the Obama administration that it would conduct an environmental impact study before allowing the   pipeline to cross Lake Oahe, the Missouri River reservoir near the encampment. But the beginning of the Trump administration brought a swift and substantial defeat: an instruction that the Army abort its study, a decision that allowed construction to resume. Barring court intervention, oil from the Bakken fields in western North Dakota could flow through the pipeline this spring. But on Wednesday, the matter at hand was what to do with the encampment, which had become an abiding and, for some, spiritual symbol of activism. State officials cited fears of flooding for the governor’s decision last week to order a mandatory evacuation of the site. “It’s time for protesters to either go home, or move to a legal site where they can peaceably continue their activities without risk of further harm to the environment,” the North Dakota attorney general, Wayne Stenehjem, said in a statement. Officials said that trash at the protest camps would pose an ecological risk if it were washed downstream by flooding, and that urgent cleanup was necessary. Both sides have accused the other of escalating tension and engaging in violence since the protest started last year as a decidedly local affair. The camps ultimately swelled to thousands in the summer and fall, with Native Americans and supporters from across the country gathering in spirited opposition and setting up a makeshift society in the camps, complete with cooking tents and supply areas. But on Wednesday, months of tension mostly gave way to a somber calm as demonstrators left and a cold rain turned to snow. Some protesters set fire to semipermanent structures before the 2 p. m. deadline. “It’s an act of defiance,” Nick Cowan, 25, said as he watched a fire burn on Wednesday after living here for more than two months. “It’s saying: ‘If you are going to make us leave our home, you cannot take our space. We’ll burn it to the ground and let the earth take it back before you take it from us. ’” Two youths were injured at the camp Wednesday, apparently from the fires, officials said, including a teenage girl who was hospitalized with severe burns. North Dakota officials offered meals, lodging, a medical exam and a bus ticket to anywhere in the 48 contiguous states for protesters who left by Wednesday afternoon but needed help getting home. That approach was at odds with events of recent months, when the demonstrators sporadically clashed with the police, leading to the activation of the North Dakota National Guard and hundreds of arrests. The police sometimes used tear gas and rubber bullets. The North Dakota Guard said on Wednesday that it had spent more than $8 million responding to the protest since August. Despite the lingering frustrations, tensions seemed to have eased in recent weeks as the ranks of demonstrators declined during the harsh winter. Dave Archambault II, the chairman of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, which has sued seeking to block the pipeline construction, urged protesters to go home. On Wednesday, many of them did. “I think people are saying goodbye,” said Ms. Red Bull, who spent about six months here. “I think that’s why people are setting things on fire: as a way of a last homage to what had become many people’s homes. A community was here. ”	1
463	Snap has long been known as the maker of Snapchat, an app that sends disappearing messages, photographs and videos. But over the past few years, the company has repositioned itself as a   camera company. One of the products that Snap has worked on to bolster that direction is a drone, according to three people briefed on the project who asked to remain anonymous because the details are confidential. A drone could help Snap’s users take overhead videos and photographs, and then feed that visual data to the company. It is unclear when or if Snap’s drone would become available to consumers. Like many technology companies, Snap often works on experiments, many of which are killed or repurposed into other projects. A Snap spokeswoman declined to comment. The work on a drone builds on Snap’s unveiling last year of Spectacles, sunglasses that record short video clips. The company also changed its name  to Snap from Snapchat to reflect that it intended to branch out into myriad products. The drone gives a glimpse into what kind of future products Snap may be considering, which would affect the company’s growth. How the company plans to grow is on the minds of investors as Snap goes public this week. Snap priced its initial public offering on Wednesday and the stock is expected to trade on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday, in what is set to be the biggest technology I. P. O. since the Chinese   company Alibaba in 2014. Snap set its I. P. O. pricing at $17 a share  —   higher than the expected range of $14 to $16  —   valuing the company at $24 billion. Getting more visual data such as photographs and video is important to Snap because it helps bolster people’s interactions with Snapchat. Communicating on Snapchat is a highly visual process, intended to create an intense engagement among people with the app. Snap said in its public offering prospectus that the average Snapchat user opened the app more than 18 times a day, and that more than 2. 5 billion messages and images were sent each day with the app. Evan Spiegel, Snap’s chief executive, has been vocal about his company’s ambitions around cameras. In a video for investors about Snap’s public offering this month, Mr. Spiegel said cameras augmented the way a person communicates, rather than a person’s memory. “We’re at the beginning of what cameras can do,” Mr. Spiegel told viewers of the video. When Spectacles appeared, Snap faced questions from critics about why it would enter the realm of hardware products. The product is designed to make taking videos a fun and seamless part of everyday life, which dovetails with the company’s goal of getting users to feed Snapchat a steady stream of images and videos. “We believe that reinventing the camera represents our greatest opportunity to improve the way that people live and communicate,” Snap said in its public offering prospectus. “Our products empower people to express themselves, live in the moment, learn about the world, and have fun together. ”	1
480	Good morning.  Here’s what you need to know: • The Trump administration faced new turmoil over new disclosures of contacts top aides had with Russian officials during the presidential campaign or prior to the inauguration. Attorney General Jeff Sessions, the top U. S. law enforcement official, recused himself from any investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election, while denying that his dicussions with a Russian official last year were related to the campaign. And the White House disclosed that the ousted national security adviser Michael Flynn and Jared Kushner, the president’s    and senior adviser, also met with the Russian ambassador in December. The outgoing Obama administration had scrambled to preserve intelligence about the Trump campaign’s possible contacts with Russia by spreading the information across the government. _____ • China’s biggest yearly political meetings, the “two sessions” of Parliament and party leaders, are set to begin in Beijing. Among the thousands of delegates are a number of billionaires, whose combined fortunes amount to  $500 billion, nearly the G. D. P. of Sweden.

100	The night President and Mrs. Trump had dinner at    with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan and his wife, Akie Abe  —   after a nice round of golf and a garden tour, before North Korea necessitated an impromptu news conference  —   Alexander Wang dragged his audience up to the crumbling abandoned RKO Hamilton Theater on 146th Street in Harlem and jammed everyone into a    area that once housed orchestra seats and now framed a raised runway. Ansel Elgort craned his neck over Luka Sabbat’s head. Zoë Kravitz was smooshed against the barrier. Lights flashed red the air smelled like beer and the models came stomping out as if they were ready to rumble. In tight black leather pants and silver studs,     tank tops and strapless cat suits in Prince of Wales check, they were dressed for it, anyway. Some chopped off their hair specially for the night. They looked mad. I mention the simultaneous events not because they have any direct relationship, but because it is increasingly clear that it is almost impossible to think about New York Fashion Week and what happens on the runway without thinking, to varying extents, about Mr. Trump. He  —   the world he has currently created  —   is the prism through which everything is seen, and evaluated. There’s just no getting away from it. And if that is a given, then the question we have to ask ourselves is not should fashion react to Trump, but rather: What is the role of fashion under Trump? So far, there has been a lot of symbolic posturing. The Council of Fashion Designers of America gave out buttons in support of Planned Parenthood, and some people have been wearing them around. Christian Siriano designed a message tee that read “People Are People” after the Depeche Mode song (sample lyrics: “People are people so why should it be   You and I should get along so awfully   Help me understand”) and paired it with a long pink   skirt. Jeremy Scott sent out on the runway a sequined tank top touting “As Seen on TV. ” At Public School, the designers Maxwell Osborne and   Chow topped off their first collection since quitting their second jobs as designers at DKNY with red baseball caps   with “Make America New York” on the front and “44  ” on the side. Their commentary on Mr. Trump was a little fuzzy  —   they said, in a statement, the show was about “constantly examining your beliefs, values and privileges and matching your intent to your action,” though sweatshirts with “We Need Leaders” made more sense  —   but it made for a good Instagram. The best burgundy nylon evening anorak I’ve ever seen  —   possibly the only one, to be fair  —   made for better clothes, however. (So, too, the flannel shirtdress with a navy train, and the jacquard   mini dress.) And potentially a more lasting impact. Victoria Beckham summed it up when she said (during a preview before her show) “The world is so confused right now, I just want to make my customer feel secure. ” In the end, the job of fashion should be to make a woman feel confident in her clothes  —   feel like a stronger version of herself  —   so she can proactively think about something else. Message tees are a beginning, but they are also easy it’s message clothing that is hard. By that measure, how are things stacking up? Despite the fact that Mr. Wang’s show seemed conceived to put a    stiletto boot into the eye of the establishment (see Bella Hadid in a vintage   sporting the words “Night of Treason”) the whole felt less convincing than calculated. It didn’t help that, though he had his show in Harlem, there were less than a handful of black models on the runway. Mr. Wang has been down the  ’n’  route before, and while he has a knack for combining the trappings of punk with some neat men’s wear tailoring and couture cuts, here the latter was unfortunately in short supply. Instead there was a lot of slicing and dicing sleight of hand. The most original part of the collection was where he put the majority of his verbiage: on sheer tights that blared “No  ” up the thigh. That at least echoed a certain truth. This is not a time for fiddling, after all. Which doesn’t mean absolutely no fun can be had (see Melissa McCarthy’s “S. N. L. ” Sean Spicer self). Jeremy Scott, by contrast, offered up not rebellion, but a raspberry. That is his wont, though this season there was surprising substance to the schtick, the latter made up of Jesus souvenir rug prints mixed in with faux leopard, boudoir bunny ruffles beneath sheer pajama sets in candy colors, Vegas Elvis metallic flares and Marilyn Monroe gowns. Among other cartoons. It was unclear whether he was parodying false idols or suggesting that everyone love thy neighbor, but either way the   provided both relevance and levity. Providing polish, however, was Jason Wu, who originally catapulted to fame thanks to Michelle Obama’s inaugural gowns. Celebrating his 10th anniversary, he provided an unofficial retrospective of greatest hits: from neat camel and glen plaid trouser suits to slouchy coed cashmeres over handkerchief hem skirts     cocktail frocks that danced around the body and a series of draped gold dévoré evening dresses. They had a quiet   that made for a good background check. But it was at Victoria Beckham that   really came into play. In her strongest show in seasons, she walked a fine line between the masculine and feminine, fragility and power, layering strictly tailored jackets and slouchy trousers in houndstooth, tartan and gray flannel over and under flyaway chiffons and sheer   all worn with      leather gloves and     leather boots for protective cover. Streams of wool and knit bumped up against each other in swingy dresses prints were fractured geometries sleeves belled out just a bit below the elbow and it added up to more than the sum of its parts. “I wasn’t interested in showpieces,” she had said earlier. “Just clothes. ” It was an emancipation proclamation, of sorts.	1
159	“Maybe I should run for president,” Denzel Washington joked, sitting down to a late breakfast in Midtown Manhattan last week, before immediately issuing a retraction. He had arrived in the States a few hours earlier from London, where he had been promoting his   movie “Fences,” and also talking about what everyone was talking about: the politics of the day. Mr. Washington told the Bagger he understood the surge of anger that had fueled Brexit and President Trump’s ascendence, and now he wanted to talk solutions. But first, he wanted grapefruit juice and eggs. He had squeezed in a few hours of   and ambled into the Park Hyatt’s restaurant looking a little rumpled still. After settling in, he also discovered two holes in his big woolly gray sweater. As commanding a presence as his onscreen personas suggest, Mr. Washington, who is 62, also carries a hint of the   professor. This is the same fellow, after all, who showed up to accept a lifetime achievement award at last year’s Golden Globes having forgotten both his speech and his glasses. But Hollywood adores Mr. Washington, who, armed with charisma and that killer smile, effortlessly charmed the Globes crowd anyway. Promoting his movie, Mr. Washington has been pushing to elevate awareness of August Wilson, the Pulitzer   playwright who wrote “Fences” and adapted it for film. Mr. Washington also has strong opinions on the political turmoil that, invariably, has come to dominate the awards season. Mr. Trump’s presidency was a result of people’s frustrations, Mr. Washington said, but the focus now has to be on finding people work and bridging the bitter national divide. “We can’t just say, ‘We’re right, you’re wrong.’ You can be angry the next four years, and so what?” Mr. Washington said. “Don’t confuse movement with progress. It can lead to progress it’s a vital part of progress. But it still has to be, ‘What are we going to do about it? ’” Mr. Washington certainly has the platform to speak out. In January, he received his seventh Oscar nomination for acting, further cementing a Hollywood royalty status that needed no help. The latest nomination, for his lead turn in “Fences,” was roundly expected, as were the movie’s other nominations, for best film (Mr. Washington was a producer) best adapted screenplay and best supporting actress, for Viola Davis, who is considered a lock to win. But Mr. Washington’s peers delivered a whopping surprise last month at the Screen Actors Guild Awards, which usually foretell Oscar winners. Throughout the season, Casey Affleck has been scooping up best actor prizes for his performance in “Manchester by the Sea,” and he was predicted to collect the guild’s trophy, too. Instead, it went to Mr. Washington, who took the stage wagging his head in disbelief, before deploying a winning strategy  —   disarm them, then own them. “I’m a   man, I’m supposed to have faith but I didn’t have faith,” he noted onstage. “I said, ‘Well, you know that young boy’s going to win, Denzel, you ain’t gonna win.’ So I didn’t even prepare. ” Then, he listed America’s most famous playwrights, making clear who he believes merit inclusion in the pantheon. “Tennessee Williams, Arthur Miller, Eugene O’Neill, Edward Albee, August Wilson,” he said. Set in the 1950s, “Fences” centers on Troy Maxson (Mr. Washington) a     baseball great and garbage collector, and his homemaker wife, Rose, played by Ms. Davis. Onscreen, Mr. Washington and Ms. Davis share a rich, affectionate familiarity, for good reason: They starred in the play’s 2010 revival, a Broadway smash that landed each of them a Tony Award. “Fences” is the sixth of Mr. Wilson’s   “Pittsburgh Cycle,” which explores   lives in each decade of the 20th century. Mr. Washington is working on bringing the remaining nine plays to the screen, for HBO, a plan no doubt helped by the success of “Fences”: It has earned $54 million domestically so far. After meeting the Bagger, he was off to see Ruben   the actor, director and playwright, who had written a first pass at a script for one play in the cycle, “Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom. ” “As a custodian of August Wilson’s estate, in terms of his plays, it’s important for me to promote ‘Fences’ to the hilt,” Mr. Washington said. (He is producing the plays in collaboration with the  estate.) “Not for me to win an award, but for it to be as successful on every level so that we can make the rest of them, you know? No business, no show. ” Getting “Fences” to the screen was a   ordeal. It was optioned in the late ’80s but was delayed partly because Mr. Wilson insisted on having an   director. Mr. Wilson died of cancer in 2005, at 60, and four years later, the powerhouse producer Scott Rudin, who had by then acquired the film rights, sent the screenplay to Mr. Washington, wanting him to star in and direct it. Mr. Washington replied that he wanted to perform it onstage first, so Mr. Rudin made it happen. “I think Denzel is by a mile the greatest living American actor,” Mr. Rudin wrote in an email, and added, “There is no movie of ‘Fences’ without him  —   just as there was no way to present it onstage without him. ” Throughout the run, audiences routinely made clear their intense connection with Mr. Washington, hissing at him when his character’s infallibilities were made plain: “Denzel, how could you?” It would take nearly five more years for Mr. Washington to feel ready to tackle the film. Four of the five main actors had appeared onstage with him, too  —   “We’re a tight band, we know the music,” he said  —   including Ms. Davis, a given. “This is where the actor meets the role,” he said. “I hope she has other great roles. But this is the role. ” (The Bagger asked about Ms. Davis’s rawest scene, where, as she weeps, thick snot runs from her nose. Mr. Washington said he had thought about digitally removing it but concluded that Wilson showed ordinary people, warts and all. “Why clean it up?” he asked.) Did he share Mr. Wilson’s belief that the film could have had only a black director? “You have to be able to understand the culture,” he replied. “Scorsese could have directed ‘Schindler’s List,’ but there’s a cultural difference. This is rooted specifically in   culture. ” Had the film come out a year earlier, it would have possibly reshaped Oscars history. Last year, controversy erupted again after all of the nominated actors ended up being, for the second year in a row, white. Yet Mr. Washington said, fervently, that the success of “Fences,” “Hidden Figures” and “Moonlight,” which also have Oscar nominations and black stars, cannot be viewed as, or reduced to, correctives to #OscarsSoWhite. “They call Wilson the American Shakespeare,” he said. “He’s not fulfilling any quota. ” And as important as it is for people to speak up, Mr. Washington said, it’s just as important for black artists to keep striving for that breakthrough. “You’ve got to keep plugging you’ve got to keep working at it, you’ve got to keep writing,” he said. “There’s an old saying: ‘If it ain’t on the page, it ain’t on the stage. ’”	1
905	 “Overcome with emotion as he described how much he’d miss his “old friend,” the owner of Triple Crown–winner American Pharoah bid a tearful farewell to the colt Monday before granting the horse its freedom, sources confirmed. “You’ve done more than I could have asked, and now you’re free to roam and run wherever you please,” said the horse’s owner, Ahmed Zayat, who, following American Pharoah’s victory in the Belmont Stakes, is said to have transported the 3-year-old colt deep into the country near a forest clearing, removed its saddle, and given the animal one last kiss on the forehead before setting it free.” Fewer than 24 hours after his tour de force triumph in the Belmont Stakes that made him racing’s first Triple Crown winner since 1978, Zayat Stables LLC’s American Pharoah is back at Churchill Downs and resting in his familiar stall at Barn 33.	0
364	It’s certainly a long way from Grand Theft Auto. Henry David Thoreau’s classic “Walden” is the inspiration for what Smithsonian Magazine is calling “the world’s most improbable video game”: Walden, a Game. Instead of offering the thrills of stealing, violence and copious cursing, the new video game, based on Thoreau’s   retreat in Massachusetts, will urge players to collect arrowheads, cast their fishing poles into a tranquil pond, buy penny candies and perhaps even jot notes in a journal  —   all while listening to music, nature sounds and excerpts from the author’s meditations. While the game is all about simplicity, it has actually been in development for nearly a decade. The lead designer, Tracy J. Fullerton, the director of the Game Innovation Lab at the University of Southern California School of Cinematic Arts, came up with the idea as a way to reinforce our connection to the natural world and to challenge our hurried culture. “Games are kinds of rehearsals,” Ms. Fullerton said in an interview. “It might give you pause in your real life: Maybe instead of sitting on my cellphone, rapidly switching between screens, I should just go for a walk. ” The game  —   which Ms. Fullerton said is likely to cost $19. 99  —   takes six hours to play. It starts in the summer and ends a year later  —   offering players tasks like building a cabin, planting beans or chatting, virtually of course, with Ralph Waldo Emerson. Should you not leave sufficient time for contemplation, or work too hard, the game cautions: “Your inspiration has become low, but can be regained by reading, attending to sounds of life in the distance, enjoying solitude and interacting with visitors, animal and human. ” Failure to heed the warning will result in a dimming of color and thinning of music. “You can choose how to spend your time, what to emphasize, the ways the game can play out,” she said. “You might spend all your time in the woods, you might focus on bean farming, you could become a famous author  —   sending off articles to your editor, Horace Greeley  —   or you could become an activist, working on the Underground Railroad. ” At a time when the most popular video games include the active participation of the player  —   slay a soldier to capture enemy territory  —   the Walden game seems passive by contrast. But Ms. Fullerton said it’s no simple stroll in the park. Players who fail to forage for food, for example, will start to faint in the game. The goal is not to win in any competitive sense, but to achieve   balance. “You’re not only trying to survive, you’re seeking inspiration in the woods,” Ms. Fullerton said, “If you spend all of your time grinding away on survival tasks, the environment will become less lush. The winning is based on whether you meet your own goals. ” The project has received grants from the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities, though some say video game research is unworthy of federal funds. And some Thoreau experts are not enthused by an electronic simulation of Walden Pond. “Go out and see your own backyard,” said Richard Higgins, whose book, “Thoreau and the Language of Trees,” is to be published in April by the University of California Press. “Nature is all around us. ” But guardians of Thoreau’s legacy say it could introduce Walden to a whole new audience. “These are people who are interested in interactive games,” said Kathi Anderson, the executive director of the Walden Woods Project in Massachusetts. “Maybe they’re not the same as the people who would sit down and read Thoreau’s book. ” Ms. Fullerton  —   whose group also created the popular 2005 flying game Cloud  —   consulted Ms. Anderson’s organization, along with the Huntington Library in Los Angeles, to create the game. They went to considerable lengths to get the 1854 details right  —   the types of trees, the sounds of   birds. Would Thoreau approve? He was clear about dismissing new technologies, if this quote is any indication: “Our inventions are wont to be pretty toys, which distract our attention from serious things. They are but improved means to an unimproved end, an end which it was already but too easy to arrive at as railroads lead to Boston or New York. We are in great haste to construct a magnetic telegraph from Maine to Texas but Maine and Texas, it may be, have nothing important to communicate. ” But Ms. Fullerton said the game  —   to be released this spring in time for the 200th anniversary of Thoreau’s birthday in July  —     the very questions “Walden” raises about the personal costs of progress. “Thoreau was sitting in a moment when life was beginning to speed up and he identified that, asking ‘Are our lives better because we now live on railroad time? ’” she said. “We have to ask ourselves the same question today: ‘Are our lives better because we live on internet time? ’” “Maybe we don’t all have the chance to go to the woods,” Ms. Fullerton added. “But perhaps we can go to this virtual woods and think about the pace of life when we come back to our own world. Maybe it will have an influence  —   to have considered the pace of Walden. ”	1
961	 Donald Trump’s election victory saved the United States from the establishment of an “Orwellian police state” in the hands of Democrats who would have used the same authoritarian tactics “over and over again” to “circumvent the will of the people in future elections,” according to Denzel Washington.“If the Democrats had won the election, we never would have found out they were using false documents to get warrants to spy on American citizens and political opponents.

486	CAIRO  —   Egypt’s top appeals court cleared former President Hosni Mubarak of any responsibility for the killing of hundreds of people during the 2011 protests that ended his   rule, sweeping away the final legal hurdle to Mr. Mubarak’s release from detention. The ruling drew cheers from Mr. Mubarak’s supporters, who have in recent years cast off the stigma once associated with his name to air increasingly vocal demands for his release. But it represented a bitter landmark for the millions of Egyptians who risked their lives to oust Mr. Mubarak and his circle during the heady,   uprising in early 2011. None of the   figures who grew rich and influential during his time in power are still in jail. The sole exception is Mr. Mubarak himself, who has been under guard for years at the Maadi Military Hospital in Cairo, at a room overlooking the Nile. But the decision to keep him in detention is widely seen here as a political matter rather than a legal one  —   constructed to avoid any embarrassment to Egypt’s current leader, President Abdel Fattah   who sometimes praises the 2011 revolution. In contrast, thousands of Egyptians who rose against him in 2011 are stuck in prison, in many cases after mass trials that drew stinging international criticism. The prisoners include supporters of the banned Muslim Brotherhood, but also activists, lawyers and journalists who dared to challenge Mr. Sisi. “It’s pretty telling that Mubarak, who ran the country into the ground, gets acquitted, and people who gave their everything to try and do something for the country are sitting in prison,” said Ahdaf Soueif, an author whose nephew, the activist and blogger Alaa Abd El Fattah, is in jail. Some Egyptian prisoners have been held without trial for years, often in terrible conditions, in stark contrast with the relatively gilded conditions enjoyed by Mr. Mubarak. According to supporters who have visited him, Mr. Mubarak gets regular deliveries of flowers, newspapers and takeout restaurant meals, as well as a constant stream of visitors. Occasionally, Mr. Mubarak emerges onto the balcony to wave at cheering supporters gathered at the hospital gates. His sons Alaa and Gamal, who were convicted on charges of embezzling millions of dollars of state money, were released from prison in 2015 and are often sighted in restaurants and shops in upscale Cairo neighborhoods. In the past six years, Mr. Mubarak has faced a slew of criminal charges for corruption and misrule. He was often seen glowering with anger when he appeared in court and was forced to sit inside a cage. But he has been convicted in just one corruption case, which concluded in 2015 when an appeals court upheld a   sentence. The judge allowed Mr. Mubarak to count time served against the sentence. Alternately defiant or embittered, Mr. Mubarak never publicly displayed much contrition for his actions during his three decades in power. On Thursday he was flown by helicopter to the courtroom, where he sat in a wheelchair and smiled at supporters from the defendant’s cage. Among those watching from the public gallery was his son Gamal, once groomed as his successor. Yousri Abdelraziq, a lawyer and Mubarak supporter who was present in court, said the former president was in a buoyant mood after his acquittal. “He fully intends to go home, perhaps in a month or two,” he said. He suggested that Mr. Mubarak might want to go to his palatial villa at the Red Sea resort of Sharm el Sheikh, which was the subject of a different, failed corruption case. The final case against Mr. Mubarak centered on accusations that he ordered shootings by security forces that led to the deaths of 239 people during the 2011 uprising. In 2012, a court sentenced Mr. Mubarak to life in prison, but an appeals court ordered a retrial, which resulted in his initial acquittal in 2014. Thursday’s ruling confirmed that acquittal, prompting renewed speculation that Mr. Sisi might release Mr. Mubarak from detention, though it could prove politically awkward. In speeches, Mr. Sisi regularly pays tribute to the 2011 uprising, which was supported by the Egyptian military. “If they let Mubarak out, what does that say about 2011  —   that the military got it wrong?” said Hisham A. Hellyer, author of “A Revolution Undone: Egypt’s Road Beyond Revolt. ” Still, Mr. Sisi’s tenure is more strongly defined by the tumultuous events that brought him to power, when the military he led toppled the democratically elected president, Mohamed Morsi of the Muslim Brotherhood, in 2013. Since then Mr. Sisi has cracked down hard on the Brotherhood, while his supporters have sought to portray the events of 2011 as a result of foreign interference in Egypt. Some Egyptians believe that Mr. Sisi might want to free Mr. Mubarak before the presidential election set to take place next year, as a means of drawing a line under the 2011 uprising. Mr. Sisi himself has yet to make his views clear. Mr. Mubarak, for his part, has always insisted he did nothing wrong. After a list of charges against the former president was read aloud in court on Thursday  —   quite possibly for the last time  —   he responded curtly: “It did not happen. ”	1

98	STORRS, Conn.  —   One year ago, on the night after Super Bowl Sunday, Geno Auriemma sat alongside three stalwart seniors and momentarily imagined a coaching life without them. “I start to blink because I look out there and start to think that these three are not going to be there next year,” Auriemma, coach of the Connecticut women’s basketball powerhouse, said after a solid road victory over   and   South Carolina. He also appeared to be blinking away a tear or two at the thought of losing those three players: Breanna Stewart, Moriah Jefferson and Morgan Tuck. That moment of emotional reflection for Auriemma, who is better known for biting sarcasm, came after a 60th consecutive victory, to which the Huskies predictably added 15 more on the way to their fourth straight (and 11th overall) national championship. Not many, including Auriemma, would have bet the mortgage on the streaks  —   both in games and titles  —   lasting much longer. But on Monday night, in a   and expectant Gampel Pavilion, the Huskies made it an even 100 straight victories, swarming that same South Carolina team,   to cross the   threshold. The Huskies did it behind their   forwards, Gabby Williams and Napheesa Collier. Williams scored 26 points and grabbed 14 rebounds while Collier added 18 and 9. “Continuing what they’ve done for so many years,” said Williams, referring to past iconic Huskies, several of whom, Stewart included, watched from the stands. It starts to sound ridiculous, but the Huskies,   this season, have not lost since November 2014 (in overtime at Stanford). If not for that loss, they’d be working on a streak of 148 straight. Even Auriemma sounded at a loss to explain this. He settled on “it was meant to be” after weeks of insisting that he and his players never talked about No. 100. Against the   and No. 6 Gamecocks, the subject was unavoidable. And after 12 successive blowouts in an American Athletic Conference in which the Huskies have gone   since its formation, the prospect of stiffer competition was preferable. With an eye on bigger game, the N. C. A. A. tournament, Auriemma said: “The   streak isn’t all theirs. They carried the streak across the finish line. But if they win the national championship, it’s all theirs. ” It’s not as if the act of breaking records is new to his program. A previous record   winning streak (surpassing the U. C. L. A. men’s record established from 1971 to 1974) was bested by the current run last month. There is no doubt that a potential fifth straight national title, and 12th over all, are numbers more appealing to Auriemma. But triple digits in consecutive wins represents another symbolic groundbreaking and powerful statement in the continued and collective excellence of a women’s sports team. Only once had Auriemma’s program come this close to 100  —   a   winning streak that stood at 99 when an upstart St. John’s team won at Gampel in February 2012, before Connecticut’s departure from what was then a highly competitive Big East Conference. “Senior night, packed house at Gampel, as always,” Kim Barnes Arico  —   then the St. John’s coach, now in her fifth season at Michigan, where she has built a     team  —   said in a telephone interview. With St. John’s trailing by 2 points in the final seconds, Barnes Arico decided during a timeout to try for the win rather than overtime in such a challenging environment. Shenneika Smith  —   “she hadn’t made a 3 in weeks”  —   sank the winning shot. On the bus ride home, Barnes Arico’s cellphone rang. “It’s Geno, calling to congratulate me after what had to be a crushing loss,” Barnes Arico said. Auriemma had been supportive of her efforts to elevate the St. John’s program, which is why, she said, “I can’t help but applaud what he’s doing there, going for 100 straight, just incredible. ” That said, she was “holding off” on reaching out, or rooting for either side on Monday, given her ties to South Carolina Coach Dawn Staley. Barnes Arico has coached   and   U. S. A. Basketball teams with Staley, a   Olympian and, like Auriemma, a Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame member. “Either way, such a great story,” Barnes Arico said. Staley’s team  —   as have most ranked teams  —   presented Connecticut with its usual handicap of a size disadvantage, with their    star, A’ja Wilson, and the    center Alaina Coates. But the Huskies countered with Williams, only   and Collier,    —   both quick jumpers who play bigger than they are. After Wilson helped keep the Gamecocks within   at the half, the Huskies limited her to 5   points. They took control late in the third quarter and were never threatened in the fourth. “You can’t let your guard down  —   UConn is going to make you pay every time,” Staley said. In surmounting every obstacle on a schedule   with   opponents, Auriemma rapidly developed a cohesive Core Four to replace the Big Three of Stewart, Jefferson and Tuck, who were the top three picks in last year’s W. N. B. A. draft. “We have no preseason   but we have four really good players, and every time we need something, one of them comes up with something,” Auriemma said, referring to the juniors Williams and Kia Nurse, and the sophomores Katie Lou Samuelson and Collier. If this wasn’t supposed to be a season of extended dominance, the question entering Monday night had evolved. Would the Huskies ever lose? “It’s not if,” Auriemma said, “it’s just when. ” But if not Monday night, or sometime this season, just when? Next season, Connecticut is planning to suit up Azura Stevens, a    transfer from Duke who many believe would have been UConn’s best player this season. The Huskies will add Megan Walker, rated by some as the nation’s No. 1 high school recruit. They will return six of their seven rotation players, the exception being Saniya Chong, who shares the   position with the freshman Crystal Dangerfield. With no formidable opponent left on the conference schedule, and victories over many of the   teams already recorded, an inquiring mind wants to wonder whether the Huskies might in a couple of years be on the doorstep of 200.	1
290	The Sunday wedding announcements in The New York Times have long been a fertile hunting ground for writers of parodies,   and other forms of snark. The best explanation of why our wedding pages make such a tempting target was provided by Robert Baedeker, one of the authors of “Weddings of The Times,” a 2009 book parodying our reports, during an interview on National Public Radio. “The wedding announcements in The Times are so perfect and polished, and the inspiration comes from that sort of primal feeling one gets when one sees a perfect picture, which is to scribble a mustache on it or draw some sunglasses on it,” Mr. Baedeker said. Such scribbled mustaches abound. The website Gawker, before closing last year, routinely took shots at us, including this post  imagining our staff at work: I envision, just so you know, a room of ladies peering skeptically over their bifocals at announcement submissions, occasionally pausing to consult worn leather bound address books  —   “I could have sworn Swoosie Remington was from Darien and not New Canaan,” they sniff  —   while Bob Woletz sits in his office lighting copies of Town  Country on fire. (For the record, Mr. Woletz, the weddings editor, lights up copies of Architectural Digest, not Town  Country.) The comedian and writer Selena Coppock has an NYTVows Twitter feed parodying the wedding pages. Here is an example: In an interview, Ms. Coppock said, almost convincingly, that she does not really hate us. So why do people like her pick on us so much? It’s partly jealousy, she explained, and partly the idea of so many big shots marrying each other. “It seems almost comical, just Ivy League upon Ivy League, the Mayflower and so on,” she said. “People get a kick out of hearing about these important families marrying into these other important families. ” The Times has grown more egalitarian through the years  —   the sons and daughters of truck drivers, waitresses and maintenance workers have graced our pages. (One of our most recent brides, an art teacher for an   program, bought her wedding dress for $6.) But that patrician reputation is hard to shake. There have been other parodies and commentaries aplenty: Jena Friedman has created videos poking fun at us, and Zach Miller’s “Veiled Conceit,” a blog from years ago, was the most elaborate. L. V. Krause wrote a memorable piece about why she keeps reading us, angrily. Here in the weddings section, we don’t mind an occasional insult thrown our way. Much. Just spell the names right, as the saying goes. Sometimes we even chuckle  —   in a dignified,    sort of way. In that spirit, we’re sharing three of the better takes on our announcements: 1. Terri Pous of BuzzFeed was so mortified by our prose that she produced a   quiz last summer asking readers whether an excerpt actually came from our pages or from her own fanciful mind. Following is a real one followed by a fake one: • “Before she started, she asked her new boss, Christine Riordan, then the provost of the university, if a boyfriend came with the job. ” • “The bridegroom had never eaten a hamburger, a fact he delightedly recounted on their first date in between bites of   seitan and kohlrabi. ” 2. Last summer, Colin Nissan, writing in The New Yorker, projected a gruesome future for a bride who graduated summa cum laude and a groom who was just magna cum laude:  This disparity in achievement will be a recurring source of tension for the couple, first rearing its head during their honeymoon, in Belize, when the groom will take a little too long to calculate a tip and the bride will step in to “summa the situation”  —   a phrase the groom will coin in that moment and continue to employ for years to come, with diminishing amusement.  …      3. We even parodied ourselves in this 1993 article in The Times’s Metro section about the wedding of a fellow who has been in the news quite a bit lately. Georgia Dullea wrote: Marla Ann Maples, the daughter of Ann Ogletree and Stanley Maples, both of Dalton, Ga. was married last night at the Plaza Hotel to Donald John Trump, a son of Mary and Fred Trump of Jamaica Estates in Queens. The bridegroom’s previous marriage ended in divorce.   …     Dr. Arthur Caliandro of the Marble Collegiate Church performed the ceremony in the Grand Ballroom, on an altar decked with white orchids and white birches. Dripping from the birches were   teardrops. Other than that, as the writer Julie Baumgold remarked after the ceremony, “There wasn’t a wet eye in the place. ” The bride is taking her husband’s name. The bridegroom is keeping his name, The Donald, a legacy from his former wife, Ivana. Ivana Trump is keeping her cool on the ski slopes of Aspen. **** This article is part of the series “Committed: 165 Years of Love (and War) in The New York Times Wedding Announcements. ”	1
435	UNITED NATIONS  —   Russia and the Trump administration clashed in a vote at the United Nations Security Council for the first time on Tuesday, as the Kremlin vetoed a measure backed by the United States and its Western allies to punish Syria for using chemical weapons. While the Russians had long signaled their intent to block the resolution, which was supported by dozens of countries, the clash offered insights into the big divisions that remain between the Kremlin and President Trump, who has vowed to improve ties. Russia and China, two of the five permanent members of the Council, blocked the measure. It was the Kremlin’s seventh Security Council veto in defense of President Bashar   of Syria over the war that has been convulsing his country for nearly six years. The American ambassador, Nikki R. Haley, who has called chemical weapons attacks in Syria “barbaric,” accused Russia and China of putting “their friends in the Assad regime ahead of our global security” in her blunt rebuke of the vetoes. “It is a sad day on the Security Council,” Ms. Haley said after the vote. “When members start making excuses for other member states killing their own people, the world is definitely a more dangerous place. ” Diplomats said that Ms. Haley had insisted on putting the measure up for a vote this week, signaling a desire to take a tough stand on Russia. In recent weeks, Ms. Haley has condemned what she called Russia’s “aggressive actions” in eastern Ukraine, vowed to maintain sanctions over Russia’s annexation of Crimea and, in her Senate confirmation hearing, went as far as saying that Russia was guilty of war crimes in Syria. Her comments on Russia have sometimes contradicted the more conciliatory language of Mr. Trump, who has made clear his desire to increase cooperation with Russia. Ms. Haley, by contrast, has often echoed the talking points of the previous administration, as well as the concerns of Republicans in Congress who distrust the Kremlin. The resolution, proposed by Britain and France months ago and endorsed by the United States last week, would have imposed sanctions on a handful of Syrian military officials and entities for having dropped   barrel bombs on   areas on at least three occasions in 2014 and 2015, according to a United Nations panel. Russia’s envoy, Vladimir Safronkov, defended the veto, calling the resolution “politically biased” and asserting that Russia’s concerns about the draft language had not been addressed. “This is railroading the draft by the Western troika,” he said. China’s ambassador, Liu Jieyi, recalling the   American warnings of Iraq’s “  W. M. D. s” in 2003, criticized the resolution as an example of “hypocrisy” by the Western powers. “It was forced through to a vote while Council members still have differences,” he said. “This is in no way helpful to finding a solution. ” Chlorine is banned as a weapon under an international treaty that Mr. Assad’s government signed in 2013. The French ambassador, François Delattre, said he welcomed the solidarity from Ms. Haley on the resolution. “The Trump administration has a very clear position that is also our French position, the British position and the position of the majority of members of the Security Council,” he said. “We’re exactly on the same page. ” Britain’s ambassador, Matthew Rycroft, said: “This isn’t even about Syria. It’s about taking a stand when children are poisoned. ” The arguments and vote over the resolution were important because they shed light on how Mr. Trump would deal with the Kremlin over the Syria war. Russia is Mr. Assad’s most important foreign ally. Mr. Trump has repeatedly expressed admiration for President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and said he wanted to strike a deal with him to stop the Syrian war and focus on fighting terrorism. But disagreements within Mr. Trump’s administration appear to have complicated that goal. A former governor of South Carolina, Ms. Haley has by her own admission limited foreign policy experience. Since she was confirmed on Jan. 24, she has limited her comments to a handful of foreign policy issues that plainly deliver political dividends at home. She has maintained a tough line on Russia and Iran, pledged to defend Israel and promised more oversight of how American funding for the United Nations is spent. She has said nothing about the Trump administration’s travel ban on refugees and visa applicants from seven predominantly Muslim countries, which the United Nations secretary general, António Guterres, has criticized. Ms. Haley, an American of Indian descent who grew up in a small South Carolina town, also has been silent on the attack on two Indian engineers in Kansas last week, which is suspected of being a hate crime and which threatens to cloud   relations. The conflict over the Syria resolution was in sharp contrast to a   consensus on the need to contain Syria’s use of chemical weapons. After a sarin gas attack on a suburb of Damascus in August 2013, Moscow and Washington struck a deal to force Mr. Assad to sign the chemical weapons treaty and dismantle his stockpile of the poisonous munitions under international supervision. The Syrian government, though, violated the deal, according to a United Nations panel set up by the Security Council, known as the Joint Investigative Mechanism. It found that the government had used chemical weapons at least three times. Russia helped to create the panel but questioned its findings when it implicated the Syrian government. The panel also found that Islamic State militants in Syria used mustard gas in August 2015. Moscow made clear last week that it would defeat the draft measure to impose sanctions on the Syrian government, calling it unbalanced. The Russian veto signaled how far Russia was willing to go to shield its ally in Damascus. Mr. Putin reinforced his opposition before the vote on Tuesday, adding that any Security Council penalties on the Syrian government would complicate diplomatic efforts underway in Geneva aimed at halting the war. “As for sanctions against the Syrian leadership, I think the move is totally inappropriate now,” he told a news conference while visiting Kyrgyzstan. “It does not help, would not help the negotiation process. It would only hurt or undermine confidence during the process. ” Human Rights Watch concluded in a recent report that the Syrian military had not only violated its promises not to use chemical weapons but had systematically dropped chlorine bombs in the final weeks of the battle to take the northern city of Aleppo last fall.	1

212	MELBOURNE, Fla.  —   Never let it be said that President Trump waits until the last minute. With just 1, 354 days until the next presidential election, Mr. Trump kicked off his   campaign here on Saturday with a boisterous,        rally that lacked only an opponent for him to run against. Gathering thousands of cheering supporters inside an airport hangar, Mr. Trump put aside the stress of Washington governing and returned to the campaign trail, where he reprised many of his   themes and lines from last year and drank in the adulation of the crowd. Buoyant and energized, he invited one fan onto the stage for a hug and even briefly turned over the microphone. “You’re all part of this incredible movement, this movement that we talk about so much, that’s been written about on the cover of every magazine all over the world,” Mr. Trump said in this Space Coast town 115 miles north of his    getaway. “It’s a moment that’s just sweeping, it’s sweeping across our country. It’s sweeping, frankly, across the globe. ” “People want to take back control of their countries,” he added, “and they want to take back control of their lives. ” With no Democratic challengers on the horizon  —   or anywhere near it  —   only a month after he took office, Mr. Trump focused instead on another favorite target, the news media, blaming journalists for any perception that his opening days in office have been less than smooth. “They have their own agenda, and their agenda is not your agenda,” he told the appreciative audience. “They could not defeat us in the primaries, and they could not defeat us in the general election, and we will continue to expose them for what they are, and most important, we will continue to win, win, win. ” He also assailed the appeals court judges who blocked his temporary travel ban, reading from a law granting the president wide discretion in setting immigration rules and chastising the court for not addressing it. He slammed Democrats for opposing his cabinet nominations vowed again to “drain the swamp” of Washington and promoted his   plans for overhauling the tax code, repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act, and building roads and bridges. “This will be change for the ages, change like never before, to pursue real peace, real stability and real prosperity,” he said. “We want to secure our borders and protect our workers, to rebuild our military and our infrastructure, to fix our schools and restore safety to our neighborhoods. ” He boasted about the soaring stock market and said a new spirit was evident in the country. “It’s going to be a new day in America,” he said. “You’re going to be proud again. Jobs are already starting to pour back in. ” For anyone who has missed the buzz of the campaign trail, including, almost certainly, the victorious candidate, it was a blast from the    past. Vendors sold the signature “Make America Great Again” red baseball caps. Supporters cheerfully chanted “CNN sucks” and “drain the swamp. ” Familiar rally songs by Elton John, the Rolling Stones and other artists were blasted over the loudspeakers. Mr. Trump talked about winning and assured the crowd that they could “believe me. ” This time, though, he came with an extra prop  —   Air Force One. The power and prestige of the presidency is unmatched, and when the    plane rolled up next to the hangar to the theme song from the Harrison Ford movie “Air Force One,” the crowd, estimated by the local police to have numbered about 9, 000, exploded. The president and Melania Trump  —   who later introduced her husband with the Lord’s Prayer  —   emerged from the plane to Lee Greenwood’s “God Bless the U. S. A. ” Never mind that an administration official had told The Washington Post two days earlier that Air Force One would not be “used in the background as a prop. ” Mr. Trump was hardly the first president to do so. The difference is that most presidents are eager to appear to remain above politics for as long as possible. Mr. Trump, by contrast, filed his   papers on Inauguration Day. Asked by reporters on Air Force One as he flew here whether it was a little early to get back into campaign mode, he said: “Life is a campaign. Making our country great again is a campaign. For me, it’s a campaign to make America great again is absolutely a campaign. ” The fan Mr. Trump called onstage was Gene Huber, 47, of Boynton Beach, Fla. He was sitting directly in front of Mr. Trump, who said he had seen Mr. Huber speaking in support of him on television. At Mr. Trump’s invitation, Mr. Huber spoke at the lectern for about 40 seconds. In an interview on Saturday night, Mr. Huber, who grew up in Lake Ronkonkoma, on Long Island, said when Mr. Trump called him to the stage, “I was like, ‘Holy mackerel, this is happening. ’” Mr. Huber, a Republican who arrived for the rally at 4 a. m. said of Mr. Trump, “Everything he says, I know he’s going to do. ” It was clearly an energizing moment for a president who has shaken up Washington with a flurry of action on his campaign promises while absorbing significant setbacks. For all the enthusiasm in the hangar, Mr. Trump is struggling to win over the wider public. As of Friday, the Gallup poll put his approval rating at 38 percent, the lowest of any modern president so early in his tenure. Near the hangar, protesters yelled slogans and waved signs. At the end of his speech, Mr. Trump was clearly reading from prepared text as he talked about unity. “Let us move past the differences of party and find a new loyalty rooted deeply in our country,” he said. But he was at his most animated when in competitive mode. “We’re going to start winning again,” he said. “Believe me. ”	1
119	For a nation of immigrants, the United States has worked hard to keep foreigners out. The Statue of Liberty was less than 40 years old when President Calvin Coolidge signed the Immigration Act of 1924. It barred immigration from most of Asia. It cut the overall quota of immigration from countries outside the Americas in half. And it limited immigrants from other countries to 2 percent of the number of people of that country’s ancestry in the United States in 1890  —   restricting immigration mostly to people from Northern and Western Europe. Those from Eastern and Southern Europe, not to say Africans, brought too many “types of social inadequacy. ” “Physically, the bodies of recent immigrants are sounder than those of the average American stock,”  Harry H. Laughlin, appointed “expert eugenics agent” to the House Committee on Immigration and Naturalization, noted in 1922 testimony. “But with this sound body we have recently admitted inferior mental and social qualities of a constitutional nature which neither education nor better environment can be expected to raise above, or even to approximate, the average of the American descended from older immigrants. ” The quota system was overhauled in 1965, and immigration law today is more evenhanded. Still, the suspicion of immigrants as threats to society remains close to the surface. By claiming that people from Muslim nations threaten national security, that Mexicans are drug dealers and rapists, that immigrants take the jobs of Americans or burden taxpayers by reliance on welfare, President Trump has drawn it back to the center of political debate. This time, suspicion is being buttressed by some economists with a proposition not too dissimilar to Laughlin’s: that immigrants could sap America’s vitality by bringing inferior cultural traits from their dysfunctional home countries to erode American social norms. It’s an unsettling assertion. It is laid out with striking candor by Paul Collier, the noted British development economist from Oxford, in his 2013 book “Exodus: How Migration Is Changing Our World” (Oxford University Press). “Migrants bring their culture with them,” he wrote. Countries that receive them run the risk “that the social model will become blended in such a way that damagingly dilutes its functionality. ” This idea has gained more currency in Europe  —   which until the recent influx from North Africa and the Middle East had experienced comparatively little immigration from poorer nations. But it is getting a hearing in the United States, too, giving shape to an argument that immigration, by bringing inferior norms and culture from abroad, may be eroding American productivity. Not unlike Laughlin in his time, George J. Borjas, a prominent Harvard economist who has written innumerable publications making a case for stricter immigration policies, argues that the quality of immigrants has deteriorated since the old days. To him, however, the dividing line is set in 1965. In his recent book “We Wanted Workers: Unraveling the Immigration Narrative” (Norton) he argues that “the new and the old arrivals are different kinds of workers, with the new arrivals being less productive. ” Contagion by immigrants from the global South is top of mind: “Imagine that immigrants do carry some baggage with them, and that baggage, when unloaded in the new environment, dilutes some of the North’s productive edge. ” Mr. Trump’s chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon, architect of the administration’s turn against immigration, might be drawn to some of this scholarship. The proposition that immigrants hamper productivity in their newfound homes could make a case for far more restrictive immigration controls than the United States has in place today. “Analogous to climate change, we do not know how large an unabsorbed diaspora would need to be before it significantly weakened the mutual regard on which the   societies depend,” Professor Collier wrote. It is true that people from other countries sometimes carry sketchy norms with them. A 2006 study by the economists Raymond Fisman and Edward Miguel found that diplomats from more corrupt countries like Egypt and Pakistan were much more likely to park illegally in New York City than those from more   places like Australia and Norway. Many studies have found that ethnic and racial heterogeneity reduces support for public goods, like trash collection and public education. The sociologist Robert Putnam, while noting many   benefits from immigration, proposed that in the short to medium run, “immigration and ethnic diversity challenge social solidarity and inhibit social capital. ” And as Mr. Borjas points out, it is true that the gap between wages of immigrants and natives is larger than it was a few decades ago, and that immigrants take longer to catch up. This may suggest that their productivity may not match that of previous waves of immigrants. Still, the proposition that immigration weighs on productivity is in tension with many studies that show that immigration tends to raise productivity and increase economic output, mostly by multiplying the earnings of immigrants themselves. Immigration to the United States increases innovation, slows the aging of the work force and opens new opportunities for some domestic workers. The growing wage gap identified by Professor Borjas may relate to things other than the immigrants’ own qualities  —   like rising income inequality in the United States. Critically, those asserting that immigrants bring a contagious decline in productivity have yet to provide any evidence that this has happened, only conjecture. Is there a threshold where further immigration starts doing real damage? How close is the United States to it? What is the mechanism whereby productivity in the United States might be reduced by immigrants’ weaker attributes? If productivity growth comes from better technology or production capabilities, how could immigrants sap it? If immigrants’ culture affects American productivity  —   say, by reducing investment or undermining belief in private property  —   how big would immigration have to be to yield that effect? It doesn’t seem the United States is anywhere near the threshold. So far, empirical evidence suggests that countries with a larger variety of immigrants are richer, more productive and more innovative. Regions that receive more immigrants grow faster. And immigration may actually  improve the institutions of the countries immigrants go to. In a rebuttal of Mr. Collier’s and Mr. Borjas’s proposition, Michael A. Clemens of the Center for Global Development and Lant Pritchett from the Kennedy School at Harvard note that there is no meaningful relationship between the share of immigrants from poor countries and productivity growth in the rich countries they immigrated to. Even if unfettered immigration from, say, Mexico, were at some point to transmit low productivity to the United States, today the evidence suggests that restrictions on immigration are too tight, not too weak. This is not to say that there is no conceivable case to slow immigration down. But the case has nothing to do with contagion. If anything, the xenophobia that powered Mr. Trump’s presidential campaign suggests that the more problematic cultural consequence of immigration is the eruption of bigotry among the natives. That could well impose a hefty cost.	1
294	When Alexa Chung, the    model, television host, design collaborator and    announced last summer that she would introduce a fashion line this spring, she refused to reveal the name of her backer. In fact, she told news outlets that she had been explicitly instructed not to do so. But in fashion, nothing stays secret for long. The man behind the brand is Peter Dubens, 50, the   and managing partner of Oakley Capital Private Equity, a midmarket company based in London that oversees assets of more than $1. 7 billion. He is considered one of Britain’s most successful investors and entrepreneurs, and has his hand in such buzzy properties as KX gym in Sloane Square, where Madonna and Daniel Craig are rumored to be clients, and the   Mark’s Club in Mayfair. But he is rarely mentioned by the media. In fact, he claims to employ a public relations firm to get him out of interviews. In photographs, he almost invariably appears in a white or blue   shirt and suit jacket,   and   with a thick head of dark, graying hair. Friends and associates describe him as “a big character” and “a family man” who is “obsessed with his boat,” “always on a diet” and “mad about tennis. ” He is not, in other words, your typical fashion investor. So how did a man more known for telecommunications than style trends end up backing the namesake label of one of Britain’s most   women? Mr. Dubens is evasive about his background when reached by phone, offering, when pressed, that he grew up in the London neighborhood of Chelsea, where he still lives, and that he attended a “Jewish school. ” (The Jewish Free School in north London, it turns out.) Mr. Dubens skipped college, instead taking a job driving a British billionaire, Joseph C. Lewis, around London and the Bahamas, and then, “with no experience at all,” going into business with Jonathan Sieff, a Marks  Spencer’s heir, selling novelty   that changed color when exposed to heat. Five years later, when Mr. Dubens was just 25, they sold the company for 8 million pounds (nearly $10 million at current exchange rates) to Coats Viyella, the clothing, furnishing and threads group. A string of successes followed, spanning online gambling (he took in £7. 5 million on the sale of 365 Media in 2006) to telecoms (Oakley Capital was involved in Pipex Communications, which sold for £330 million in 2007). “As you can tell from my background, I’m a bit unorthodox, and I’m passionate about backing young and new entrepreneurs,” he said, noting that the draw was not about investing in “luxury or glamorous brands. ” Still, in addition to Ms. Chung’s fledging business, he has invested personally and through his venture capital fund, Pembroke VCT, in Bella Freud’s fashion label, known for its graphic cashmere sweaters as well as the genealogy of its founder (she is the daughter of the artist Lucian Freud and   of Sigmund Freud). The hidden link tying Mr. Dubens, Ms. Freud and Ms. Chung? That would be Laura Bailey, a model and British Vogue contributor. While vacationing in St.  several years ago, Mr. Dubens met Ms. Bailey and they developed what she describes as a “formalized friendship” she introduced him first to Ms. Freud and later to Ms. Chung. “He’s got a very big feel for talent and marketing and potential,” she said, adding that he gives the designers “real freedom” in letting them run their businesses. “That’s a plus. I think the danger in these kinds of relationships is too many cooks. ” Ms. Freud said: “He’s not one of those vanity people who want to be the big cheese. He is a big cheese, but he just seems to have quite a lot of fun sailing his yacht around and stuff. “A lot of those kind of people who are money people, they are quite controlling and bullying,” she continued. “He doesn’t say, ‘Flares are coming back in, why don’t you do those?’ ” Edwin Bodson, the head of atelier at Haider Ackermann, who moved to London to become managing director of Alexa Chung in April, said: “What I have learned from Peter is that time has to be treated with discipline. No real problem needs more than 15 minutes of attention if it is well analyzed. ” This May, Ms. Chung’s first collection will arrive at stores, including Bergdorf Goodman in New York and MatchesFashion in London. It will be priced according to what Mr. Bodson described as the “high contemporary” category, from $100 to $120 for a   and $800 to $1, 500 for a sequined dress or jacket. The pieces will be, he said, “close to what people expect”  —   that is, garments in line with Ms. Chung’s signature style. So anticipate a tea dress or two, some constructed jackets and a helping of skinny denim. To coincide with the introduction, Ms. Chung will host an event that Mr. Bodson described as a kind of fashion show, but not restricted to industry members and media. Before other young fashion designers get too excited, however, Mr. Dubens said he had no plans to invest in more apparel brands. “I don’t personally make investments in smaller companies any more,” he said. “Alexa is my last one. ”	1
631	 Gary-Jo Henderson, 61, of Charlotte was known by friends and family as a hardcore American currency collector. His wife, Martha Henderson is a collector of Civil War memorabilia. Both traveled acrossed the country to buy and auction off their historical collections. According to reports, Mrs. Henderson arrived at their residence at approximately 6:15 P.M. when she discovered her husband, unresponsive in his home office. Mrs. Henderson immediately called 911 while attempting to resuscitate her husband.According to Mrs. Henderson, “After I found my husband slumped over in his chair, I ran over to him to see if he was okay. When he did not respond to me, I checked to see if he was sleeping and that is when I saw that he was not breathing. I called 911 and I tried to give him CPR until the ambulance arrived. After a few attempts, I notice an empty bottle of Percocets on his desk. I then saw a note near the bottle which read’Make American White Again’. When I opened the letter, that is when I found out he committed suicide. … Reportedly, part of the letter read, ‘It’s a shame that one of our founding fathers is being replaced by a N**GER. I never thought I would live to see a spade in the White House and now one of them will be on the money we spend each day. I’m tired of seeing N**GERS taking over our great nation. I refuse to live in a world overrun by Blacks. I hope Trump wins so we can make America White Again!”	0
205	The Syrian stars of two   films will travel to the Academy Awards after all, representatives said, now that President Trump’s travel ban has been lifted. Raed Saleh  —   the leader of a Syrian civilian rescue group and a subject of the documentary short that bears the group’s name, “The White Helmets”  —   will be on the red carpet and attend the ceremony on Feb. 26. With him will be his fellow rescuer Khaled Khatib, who also worked as a cinematographer on the film, which has been nominated for best documentary short. Financed by Western governments, the White Helmets have saved the lives of more than 75, 000 Syrians, pulling them from the rubble of   buildings and administering emergency first aid. Hala Kamil, a Syrian refugee and mother of four now living in Germany, will also be attending the awards now, too. Mrs. Kamil and her children fled Syria after her husband was kidnapped by the Islamic State. Their ordeal is captured in “Watani: My Homeland,” which is also up for best documentary short. In a statement, Mrs. Kamil said she would be attending the ceremony with a heavy heart, as she and her husband, who is presumed dead, made a ritual out of watching the Oscars each year. “But to be reminded of what I have lost is also a reminder of what I have held on to: my children,” she said. The filmmakers of both documentaries said they had always intended to bring their subjects to the Oscars. But those plans were upended when Mr. Trump signed an executive order last month banning visas for travelers from seven   countries, including Syria. This month, federal courts blocked the ban, though Mr. Trump suggested at a news conference on Thursday that he might issue a new order next week. Mr. Khatib, the cinematographer, is hurrying to get on a flight to the United States before another potential travel ban. Attending the Oscars, Mr. Khatib said in a statement, would help not only broadcast the urgency of Syrians’ plight, but also bring hope to his beleaguered countrymen back home. “I do this work because I believe if the world understands the suffering of my people, they will be moved to stop it, to stand with us on the side of life,” he said. “The White Helmets have a motto taken from the Quran: ‘To save a life is to save all humanity. ’”	1

124	HAMAD CITY, Gaza Strip  —   Wail   is grateful for his new apartment here in a growing neighborhood in southern Gaza. For just $140 a month, there are separate bedrooms for his three girls and two boys, as well as a guest bathroom. The complex is being built by Qatar, the   Persian Gulf state that has stepped in repeatedly in recent years to help isolated,   Gazans. But there are limits to Mr. Gatshan’s thankfulness. “As a Palestinian, I would not support Qatar if they said they wanted a   solution,” said Mr. Gatshan, 44. “I want my human rights. My rights are to live without any limits or restrictions and without occupiers. ” For years, the Obama administration struggled to forge a peace deal between the Israelis and Palestinians, only to run headlong into unsurmountable obstacles: a   Israeli government, fractured Palestinian leadership, and an Arab world consumed by its own upheavals. Since then the barriers to peace have grown even more formidable, and attitudes like Mr. Gatshan’s more entrenched. When President Trump and Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, meet in Washington on Wednesday they are likely to discuss a change of tactics, relying on Arab states like Qatar to help secure an   solution, under which Israel and an independent Palestinian state would live   . A White House official said Tuesday that Mr. Trump’s objective was peace between the two sides, but it did not necessarily need to take the form of a   solution. But even if Mr. Trump does not abandon the   solution, any route to peace contains many pitfalls. The Trump administration plans to focus on an “ ” approach, meaning that Israel would first pursue agreements with Arab countries to help solve the conflict with the Palestinians. But that is a long shot, experts say, given some of the crises gripping the region: Saudi Arabia is mired in a war in Yemen Egypt is reeling from economic and security concerns and Jordan is focused on securing its borders with Iraq and Syria. Israel’s government has moved steadily to the right, expanding settlements on land that the Palestinians and much of the rest of the world say should be part of a future Palestinian state. And the Palestinians remain sharply divided: The Palestinian Authority, backed by the United States and European powers, governs parts of the West Bank, while Hamas, a militant Islamist movement committed to Israel’s destruction, rules the coastal Gaza Strip. Given those realities, there is little that Arab countries can do to break the deadlock, especially at a time when uprisings and wars have left them focused on domestic affairs, said Oraib   the director of the Quds Center for Political Studies in Jordan. “What can Jordan or Egypt or Saudi Arabia do?” he said. “In the end, the occupation has to end, or you will have no end to the conflict. ” Historically, sympathy for the Palestinians and their quest for statehood was one of few unifying causes across the Arab world. Arab armies came together to wage wars against the Jewish state, and many governments later provided financial and military aid to armed Palestinian factions. Even after the Oslo peace accords of 1993 led to the creation of the Palestinian Authority, most Arab countries rejected formal relations with Israel on principle, considering it a usurper of Arab land. Jordan and Egypt have peace treaties with Israel, but Israel remains unpopular with their citizens. But the prominence of the Palestinian issue in the Arab consciousness has waned in recent years, as the Arab state system has weakened because of popular uprisings and civil conflicts. Saudi Arabia and its allies in the Persian Gulf are bogged down in a war against Houthi rebels in Yemen and are increasingly worried about  Iran’s  influence  —   a concern they share with Israel. Syria and Iraq, longtime enemies of Israel, have been locked in lengthy wars that have drained their governments’ resources and given them little time to focus on issues beyond their borders. Egypt, too, has turned inward, as its economy has worsened and a jihadist insurgency has taken root on the Sinai Peninsula. “Care is there, but attention is not,” Mahmoud Yehia, an Egyptian lawmaker, said of the Palestinian cause. “People are dealing with all these new internal issues now, and they have been struggling economically for years and years before that. ” Supporters of the   approach say that the merging of interests between Israel and Arab states like Saudi Arabia and Egypt could provide an opening. But that approach has been tried before, without success, in large measure because of deep and nearly universal Arab opposition to Israel. Arab leaders will not dare be seen to align their interests with the Jewish state, even when there is common cause, like opposition to Iran and to terrorist groups like the Islamic State. Last year, a survey of attitudes across the Middle East by Zogby Research Services found that 41 percent of respondents in Egypt and 39 percent in Saudi Arabia considered the Israeli occupation of Palestinian lands to be “the greatest obstacle to regional peace,” surpassing any other issue. So while Saudi and Egyptian leaders may collaborate with Israel privately on issues of shared interest, doing so publicly could incite a blowback from their populations. For many Arabs, the sheer number of crises in the region leaves little energy left for the Palestinians. “There is also a growing realization among people that the region is now very chaotic,” said H. A. Hellyer, a nonresident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, a research organization in Washington. That causes “a sense of helplessness” toward the Palestinian issue. The divisions among Palestinians also undermine support for their cause. “Even if they wanted to do something, they don’t know who they should support now,” Mr. Hellyer said. And many Palestinians have given up on the idea of a   solution. A decade has passed since Palestinian infighting left the West Bank and Gaza under the control of competing administrations with opposing views of how to pursue statehood. Multiple rounds of talks have gained only limited benefit for the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank, which supports a   solution, while Hamas’s dedication to its slogan of “resistance” seems as strong as ever. On Monday, it announced that Yehya Sinwar, a   member of its military wing, had been chosen as its new Gaza leader. Others feel that too much time has passed to expect that the West Bank and Gaza can again be brought under a single authority. “It’s impossible to have a Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza,” said Ibrahim Madhoun, a columnist for the   newspaper Al Resala. “Now, Gaza is one thing and the West Bank is something else. ” Hamad City, where Mr. Gatshan lives with his family, is home to tidy shops, playgrounds and a mosque that will soon hold 3, 000 people. A second wing of roughly 1, 400 spacious units has just opened. But the Qatari initiative has risen on a potent symbol of deadlock. Much of the land once belonged to an Israeli settlement, which was evacuated in 2005. Israel called it a move toward peace. Gazans said settlers should never have been there in the first place. But Israelis complain bitterly that this evacuation showed that pulling back from settlements does not work: Militant groups, including Hamas, fired rockets into Israel. Three wars followed. Though Hamas has declared a truce, and largely controls other groups who try to continue fighting, some Israelis say a new war in Gaza is the only way to ultimately achieve peace. Israel “cannot be the only country in the world where children cannot walk down the street without worrying that a missile will fall,” Naftali Bennett, a   lawmaker and education minister, said on a visit to the fence dividing Gaza and Israel last week. “Our enemies are investing all their resources in developing ways to kill us. ” “Only with a complete victory,” he said, “can we put an end to this cycle. ”	1
621	 Tuesday, our beloved actor Jim Carrey passed away due to a fatal plane crash. Jim was born on January 17, 1962. He will be missed but not forgotten. Please show your sympathy and condolences by commenting on and liking this page. One reason is “like-farming.” Facebook’s algorithms in particular emphasize popular content, and therefore gathering “likes” and “shares” receives a high premium. Sometimes, it’s just an annoyance — maybe that kid really does want a hundred thousand “likes” so that a Victoria’s Secret model will go to a school dance with him, so he’s inundating people with appeals (although that’s doubtful at best) — but more often, the intent is scammy. Like-farmers will gather clicks, which denote popularity, then scrub the original content and replace it with something else (usually a scammy ad of some sort) to bypass Facebook constraints. Facebook has moved to quash this behavior by adjusting their algorithms, but of course, some scammers’ efforts always get by the online gatekeepers.	0
943	 Men at a village in the North West are leaving in fear over a big male baboon that likes to grope and bonk human males.The baboon is said to have attacked more than six men in the past week and what’s baffling the villagers is the fact that the baboon only attacks guys and does not hurt it’s victims but rather performs sexual acts on top of the terrified victim and leaves.One victim, George Chiune said he was coming from the local shebeen when the baboon attacked him and pinned him down.“I thought it wanted to kill me but realized it was after my bum,”, George said.Five men were admitted to hospital yesterday after experiencing acute anal pains and fatigue. Doctors confirmed the men have anal cancer.The baboon, which has been nicknamed Somizi travels alone and this, according to animal behaviour specialist is a strange occurrence because baboons are known to ravel in troops. One specialist, Lizzie McKenzie said “the baboon might be an outcast and chased away from it’s troop. That is why it is travelling alone but as to the reason it’s attacking only males, it beats me. I have never seen that behaviour in my 20 years in this field,” she said.When journalists visited the village, all male school kids were said to be wearing dresses as a preventative measure until the baboon has been dealt with. Advertising can’t fund his journalism either. His real news site attracts just a fraction of the audience of his fake news sites and, therefore, a fraction of the income. “There aren’t that many people interested in politics. I can earn a few hundred dollars a month from my news site, it performs so badly. But stuff about gay baboons, stuff about pastors saying they went to heaven, that goes viral,” he says.	0
27	Fairies can be so fickle. One night, all you want to do is break a spell. The next, with ice in your veins and a malicious flourish, you put a curse into action. On Thursday, Sara Mearns, the glamorous New York City Ballet principal, made an unlikely debut: the evil Fairy Carabosse in “The Sleeping Beauty. ” Her usual role, which she performed Wednesday, is the Lilac Fairy, Princess Aurora’s shimmering protector who counteracts Carabosse’s curse of death. Ms. Mearns, 31, is no polite ballerina, but an    dancer who reacts on the spot through her deep connection with music. Speaking twice in her dressing room on Thursday  —   once during intermission and later after her brief, ferocious appearance in the second act  —   Ms. Mearns reflected on the two roles. “Carabosse is like spitfire  —   short and sweet,” she said. “With the Lilac Fairy, I feel very empowered. You’re sort of in charge of the whole extravaganza. You’re always there. ” After a parting hug so she could take her bow  —   “Don’t get caught in the wing,” she said, referring not to the stage but to the appendage on her glittering black dress  —   she headed back out. For the record, the crowd roared. Ms. Mearns grinned with delight. Here are edited excerpts from the conversation. Who did you model Carabosse on?  I wanted her to be the Maleficent Disney [animated] version where she just stands there. She’s actually somewhat nice and doesn’t scream in the beginning. Peter [Martins, the ballet master in chief] told me: “Carabosse is just as beautiful as the Lilac Fairy. You should be above it all. But what’s different is that your soul is evil. ” Your rage seemed to bubble up inside of you. Is that what it felt like?  Yes. I actually didn’t think that was going to happen! When I’ve seen people do that, I’ve been like, there’s no way that I could get myself to do that. I would feel so stupid. And then when I got onstage, there was no one standing in front of me. I was just like, oh my God, this feels right. What did you not want Carabosse to be? I didn’t want to come out screaming like a crazy person. I feel like I have a really different approach. The music makes you want to go there because it’s so powerful  —   it makes you want to scream. The costume does it. You just standing there already does it. You just have to rein it in. It was hard, but once I really committed to the way I was going to do it, I felt comfortable. Was the experience what you thought it would be like?  Yes and no. I was waiting for this thrill of being evil onstage. I was more nervous than I thought I would be. I don’t think I’ve actually done a character role that doesn’t require dancing. There was such a different nervousness, such a different placement of your feet and your stance. Lilac Fairy is so much a part of me that I can grab it at a moment’s notice, but Carabosse is so much deeper and harder to find that it took everything out of me. I actually get more tired doing this because my whole body is so tense. You can’t hide behind your dancing, which is your comfort zone. Were you dancing with your hands?  Yes. The first time I had used the nails was in the stage rehearsal, and I saw how much you can do because your fingers are much longer than they normally are. I came up with this thing that I was doing on my chest. [She drummed her fingers slowly.] That part made me laugh.  I came up with it in the shower this morning. I felt like my hands were dancing instead of my feet. Your nails are scary. What are they? They’re plastic fingers, and we have to tape them on. In the dress rehearsal, I lost two nails when I pulled off [the master of ceremonies] Catalabutte’s wig because I didn’t tape them right. I can’t really feel my fingertips right now because they’re so tight, but it’s good. They won’t fall off. Does Carabosse produce a different kind of adrenaline than the Lilac Fairy?  Yes. Dancing adrenaline is excitement  —   it’s like, I can’t wait to do those steps, I can’t wait to have that feeling. This is deeper. It’s a   thing happening. You transform your soul to a dark place. You’re not really happy when you come offstage. I couldn’t tell if you were annoyed because you had to do an interview, or if you were still in character.  [Laughs.] No. I’m still so mad! When you come off, you’re not like, I did such a great job. You’re simmering. With Carabosse, you can really go for it. You can scare people, throw people, just do whatever. I want to shock them.	1
336	LONDON  —   When Cressida Dick left Scotland Yard three years ago, she said she hoped that one day a woman would lead Britain’s biggest police force to show that it was “modern and representative. ” On Wednesday, those hopes were realized when Ms. Dick herself was named the first female police commissioner in Scotland Yard’s   history. A onetime beat cop in London’s West End, Ms. Dick, 56, said she was “thrilled and humbled” by the appointment. “This is a great responsibility and an amazing opportunity,” she said Wednesday in a statement. “I’m looking forward immensely to protecting and serving the people of London. ” Founded in 1829, Scotland Yard, as the city’s Metropolitan Police Service is known, is the recipient of roughly a quarter of all police spending in England and Wales. (Scotland and Northern Ireland, the other two nations in the United Kingdom, have their own legal systems and police forces.) The daughter of Oxford academics and a graduate of both Oxford and Cambridge, Ms. Dick was head of counterterrorism at Scotland Yard from 2011 to 2014, overseeing among other things the security operation for the London Olympics in 2012. She left Scotland Yard in 2014 after 31 years to become general secretary at the foreign office. Ms. Dick has held command roles in several counterterrorism operations one operation went terribly wrong in 2005: She was the senior officer in charge when Jean Charles de Menezes, 27, a Brazilian who had been mistakenly identified as an attempted suicide bomber, was fatally shot by officers at a London subway station. A jury cleared her of any wrongdoing, but Ms. Dick has repeatedly expressed regret. “I think about what happened on that terrible day very, very often,” she said in 2014. During the search for a new commissioner, the family of Mr. de Menezes wrote a letter to London’s mayor, Sadiq Khan, about Ms. Dick’s potential role. “We have serious concerns about such an appointment and the signal it sends to the people of London,” they wrote. But Mr. Khan and others defended Ms. Dick’s appointment. “This is a historic day for London and a proud day for me as mayor,” he said Wednesday. Amber Rudd, the home secretary who appointed Ms. Dick with Mr. Khan’s counsel, called her an “exceptional leader” and implicitly highlighted her gender as a possible asset in some pressing issues facing Scotland Yard. “The challenges ahead include protecting the most vulnerable, including victims of sexual abuse and domestic violence,” Ms. Rudd said. “Cressida’s skills and insight will ensure the Metropolitan Police adapt to the changing patterns of crime in the 21st century. ” Of the 43 police forces in England and Wales, several have been led by women. But never London. Alex Carlile, a member of the House of Lords, Britain’s upper chamber, who served as an independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, said it was “a very positive thing” that Scotland Yard had women in leadership roles. “But Cressida Dick has not been appointed because she’s a woman,” he said. “She’s been appointed because she was the   person for the job. ” With Ms. Dick’s appointment, three of the most senior figures in British policing are now women, with Lynne Owens heading the National Crime Agency and Sara Thornton, one of Ms. Dick’s rivals for the Scotland Yard job, the chairwoman of the National Police Chiefs’ Council.	1
550	 As reported early this morning by CNN and HuffPost, Donald Trump, in a phone interview with Fox News’ Steve Doocy, claimed as President of the United States, he would seek to cut-out all unnecessary spending. When pressed for specifics, the GOP frontrunner dismissively quipped, “Well, I think we spend way too much on organizations and departments that just ‘save’ stuff. For instance, I’d make a move to get rid of the Library of Congress.”Trump continued, “Y’know what? Old books, decomposing newspapers, pansy artwork and a bunch of black and white movies about women and illegal immigrants have no business being “protected” with our hard-earned tax dollars. My first act as President would be to dissolve wasteful branches of government like the Library and that Kennedy Center for Peforming Arts stuff, and sell the material to China for huge profits.”	0
20	A   panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit on Thursday unanimously upheld a Federal District Court judge’s decision to temporarily block the Trump administration from carrying out its executive order on immigration. The executive order would bar entry into the United States of citizens from seven   countries. Here are some highlights from the ruling: The court summarizes what the case is about at this stage. Its job is not to look squarely at whether the executive order is lawful, but rather at whether the standards have been met to temporarily block the government from enforcing it while the broader legal questions are more fully considered. The judges unanimously decided to keep blocking the order. The Trump administration had argued that the appeals court should reject the lawsuit without scrutinizing any of its legal merits, because the two states that filed it had no standing to sue. The appeals court disagreed, primarily because of the impact the travel ban would have on public universities. The Trump administration has argued that the judiciary should stay out of the case. The appeals court strongly disagrees as a matter of constitutional first principles. Several days after Mr. Trump issued his executive order, the administration partially pulled back with a directive from his White House counsel, Donald F. McGahn II, saying it would not apply to green card holders. The judges are dubious about the credibility of what the executive branch says is happening. This is the core of the ruling. The court thinks it is likely that the executive order will eventually be struck down as an unconstitutional violation of people’s due process rights. In deciding whether to let the executive order be enforced while the arguments are more fully litigated, the courts have to weigh the potential injury to the people who would be affected by the travel ban against the potential injury to society of blocking the order in the interim. Because the Trump administration offered no evidence suggesting that the prior system was inadequate for screening visitors from the seven countries, the court ruled against the government.	1

361	Cue the Johnny Cash music. On Sunday, a “ring of fire” eclipse will blaze over parts of South America and the southern and western tips of Africa. Scientifically known as an annular eclipse, this solar phenomenon occurs when the moon moves in between the sun and the Earth but is too far away to completely block the sun as it would during a total solar eclipse. “Because you have this thin little ring around the edge of the moon where the sun pokes out, it gives it that ring of fire effect,” said C. Alex Young, a solar astrophysicist from NASA. The moon’s orbit around the Earth is elliptical, meaning that at some points it is farther away from the Earth than at others, according to Dr. Young. Annular eclipses occur when the moon is at or near its greatest distance, known as apogee. The countries with the best chance to watch the “ring of fire”    include Chile and Argentina in South America as well as Angola, Zambia and the Democratic Republic of Congo in Africa. They are along something called the path of annularity. That’s where the moon’s shadow is cast on Earth, and it varies between 18 miles and 55 miles in width as it moves. Those outside of the line will be able to see a partial solar eclipse, which looks like some galactic giant took a bite out of the sun. Sunday’s annular eclipse will begin over parts of the Pacific Ocean. It will quickly make landfall in southern Chile around 9:10 a. m. local time, and then traverse into Argentina. Sky watchers in Argentina will see approximately 97 percent of the sun covered by the moon for about a minute, according to Dr. Young. After that, the spectacle will cross the South Atlantic into Africa. It will hit parts of Angola around 4:15 p. m. local time and make appearances in Zambia and the Democratic Republic of Congo before the sun sets. It will last for a minute and a few seconds when it crosses over these countries. If you’re not in South America, Africa or on a boat in the southern oceans, there will be a live stream from Slooh Community Observatory, a system of telescopes that observe the sky, beginning around 7 a. m. Eastern time. But if you’re in the United States, you should not experience too much fear of missing out, Dr. Young said. Come Aug. 21, you will have the opportunity to see a total solar eclipse. “There’s absolutely no comparison. While the annular eclipse is pretty exciting with its ‘ring of fire’ effect, it’s still just this bright object in the sky,” Dr. Young said. “But during the solar eclipse it’s not just what you see, it’s what you experience. The whole environment changes. ” Another big difference between a total eclipse and the annular eclipse is that you cannot see the sun’s corona  —   its outer atmosphere that appears as white wisps of light  —   during an annular eclipse. “We won’t be able to see the corona because it’s just going to be swamped by the photosphere, the visible surface of the sun,” Dr. Young said. “The photosphere is a million times brighter than the corona. ” He warns that the fiery ring will be very bright, so even though it will not be a total solar eclipse, you should wear a pair of eclipse glasses to watch the performance.	1
333	The village is poor, even by the standards of rural Kenya. To get there, you follow a power line along a series of unmarked roads. Eventually, that power line connects to the school at the center of town, the sole building with electricity. Homesteads fan out into the hilly bramble, connected by rugged paths. There is just one working water tap, requiring many local women to gather water from a pit in jerrycans. There is no plumbing, and some families still practice open defecation, lacking the resources to dig a latrine. There aren’t even oxen strong enough to pull a plow, meaning that most farming is still done by hand. The village is poor enough that it is considered rude to eat in public, which is seen as boasting that you have food. In October, I visited Kennedy Aswan Abagi, the village chief, at his small   home, decorated with posters celebrating the death of Osama bin Laden and the lives of African heroes, including JaKogelo, or “the man from Kogelo,” as locals refer to former President Barack Obama. Kogelo, where Obama’s father was born, is just 20 miles from the village, which lies close to the banks of Lake Victoria. Abagi told me about the day his town’s fate changed. It happened during the summer, when field officers from an American nonprofit called GiveDirectly paid a visit, making an unbelievable promise: They wanted to give everyone money, no strings attached. “I asked, ‘Why this village? ’’u2009” Abagi recalled, but he never got a clear answer, or one that made much sense to him. The villagers had seen Western aid groups come through before, sure, but nearly all of them brought stuff, not money. And because many of these organizations were religious, their gifts came with moral impositions I was told that one declined to help a young mother whose child was born out of wedlock, for example. With little sense of who would get what and how and from whom and why, rumors blossomed. One villager heard that GiveDirectly would kidnap children. Some thought that the organization was aligned with the Illuminati, or that it would blight the village with giant snakes, or that it performed blood magic. Others heard that the money was coming from Obama himself. But the confusion faded that unseasonably cool morning in October, when a GiveDirectly team returned to explain themselves during a town meeting. Nearly all of the village’s 220 people crowded into a    tent placed near the school building, watching nervously as 13 strangers, a few of them white, sat on plastic chairs opposite them. Lydia Tala, a Kenyan GiveDirectly staff member, got up to address the group in Dholuo. She spoke at a deliberate pace, awaiting a hum and a nod from the crowd before she moved on: These visitors are from GiveDirectly. GiveDirectly is a nongovernmental organization that is not affiliated with any political party. GiveDirectly is based in the United States. GiveDirectly works with mobile phones. Each person must have his or her own mobile phone, and they must keep their PIN secret. Nobody must involve themselves in criminal activity or terrorism. This went on for nearly two hours. The children were growing restless. Finally, Tala passed the microphone to her colleague, Brian Ouma. “People of the village,” he said, “are you happy?” “We are!” they cried in unison. Then he laid out the particulars. “Every registered person will receive 2, 280 shillings”  —   about $22  —   “each and every month. You hear me?” The audience gasped and burst into wild applause. “Every person we register here will receive the money, I said  —   2, 280 shillings! Every month. This money, you will get for the next 12 years. How many years?” “Twelve years!” Just like that, with peals of ululation and children breaking into dance in front of the strangers, the whole village was lifted out of extreme poverty. (I have agreed to withhold its name out of concern for the villagers’ safety.) The nonprofit is in the process of registering roughly 40 more villages with a total of 6, 000 adult residents, giving those people a guaranteed,      income. An additional 80 villages, with 11, 500 residents all together, will receive a   basic income. With this initiative, GiveDirectly  —   with an office in New York and funded in no small part by Silicon Valley  —   is starting the world’s first true test of a universal basic income. The idea is perhaps most in vogue in chilly,   places, among them Canada, Finland, the Netherlands and Scotland. But many economists think it might have the most promise in places with poorer populations, like India and   Africa. GiveDirectly wants to show the world that a basic income is a cheap, scalable way to aid the poorest people on the planet. “We have the resources to eliminate extreme poverty this year,” Michael Faye, a founder of GiveDirectly, told me. But these resources are often misallocated or wasted. His nonprofit wants to upend incumbent charities, offering major donors a platform to push money to the world’s neediest immediately and practically without cost. What happens in this village has the potential to transform   institutions, but its effects might also be felt closer to home. A growing crowd, including many of GiveDirectly’s backers in Silicon Valley, are looking at this pilot project not just as a means of charity but also as the groundwork for an argument that a universal basic income might be right for you, me and everyone else around the world too. The basic or guaranteed income is a curious piece of intellectual flotsam that has washed ashore several times in the past   often during periods of great economic upheaval. In “Utopia,” published in 1516, Thomas More suggests it as a way to help feudal farmers hurt by the conversion of common land for public use into private land for commercial use. In “Agrarian Justice,” published in 1797, Thomas Paine supports it for similar reasons, as compensation for the “loss of his or her natural inheritance, by the introduction of the system of landed property. ” It reappears in the writings of French radicals, of Bertrand Russell, of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Silicon Valley has recently become obsessed with basic income for reasons simultaneously generous and   as a palliative for the societal turbulence its inventions might unleash. Many technologists believe we are living at the precipice of an   revolution that could vault humanity into a postwork future. In the past few years, artificially intelligent systems have become proficient at a startling number of tasks, from reading cancer scans to piloting a car to summarizing a sports game to translating prose. Any job that can be broken down into discrete, repeatable tasks  —   financial analytics, marketing, legal work  —   could be automated out of existence. In this vision of the future, our economy could turn into a   version of itself: extreme income and wealth inequality, rising poverty, mass unemployment, a shrinking   labor force. It would be more George Saunders than George Jetson. But what does this all have to do with a small village in Kenya? A universal basic income has thus far lacked what tech folks might call a proof of concept. There have been a handful of experiments, including ones in Canada, India and Namibia. Finland is sending money to unemployed people, and the Dutch city Utrecht is doing a trial run, too. But no experiment has been truly complete, studying what happens when you give a whole community money for an extended period of time  —   when nobody has to worry where his or her next meal is coming from or fear the loss of a job or the birth of a child. And so, the tech industry is getting behind GiveDirectly and other organizations testing the idea out. Chris Hughes, a Facebook founder and briefly the owner of The New Republic, has started a $10 million,   initiative to explore the viability of a basic income. (He has also been a major donor to GiveDirectly.) The research wing of Sam Altman’s   incubator, Y Combinator, is planning to pass out money to 1, 000 families in California and another     state. Then there is GiveDirectly itself, which has attracted $24 million in donations for its   effort, including money from founders of Facebook, Instagram, eBay and a number of other Silicon Valley companies. Many donors I spoke with cited their interest in the project as purely philanthropic. But others saw it as a chance to learn more about a universal basic income, a way to prove that it could work and a chance to show people the human face of a hypothetical policy fix. In December, Altman, the    president of Y Combinator, spoke at an   event hosted by Stanford, the White House and the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, the charitable institution the Facebook billionaire founded with his wife, Priscilla. Altman discussed the potential for basic income to alleviate poverty, but his speech veered back to the dark questions that hang over all this philanthropy: Is Silicon Valley about to put the world out of work? And if so, do technologists owe the world a solution? “There have been these moments where we have had these major technology revolutions  —   the Agricultural Revolution, the Industrial Revolution, for example  —   that have really changed the world in a big way,” Altman said. “I think we’re in the middle or at least on the cusp of another one. ” GiveDirectly may be a charity, but it speaks in the argot of Silicon Valley. It is a platform, connecting donors and recipients, that prides itself on low overhead and superior analytics. It disdains what it sees as the bloated, expensive,     incumbents that dominate the nonprofit space. And it even has a privileged bootstrapping creation story, beginning with its   founders batting the idea around in Harvard Square academic buildings and scraping together money from friends. The idea for the nonprofit came to Michael Faye and Paul Niehaus, who is now a professor of economics at the University of California, San Diego, when they were graduate students at Harvard. Both were studying development and doing fieldwork overseas, an experience that underlined an Economics 101 lesson: Cash was more valuable to its recipients than the   gifts commonly distributed by aid groups, like food or bed nets or sports equipment. If you’re hungry, you cannot eat a bed net. If your village is suffering from endemic diarrhea, soccer balls won’t be worth much to you. “Once you’ve been there, it’s hard to imagine doing anything but cash,” Faye told me. “It’s so deeply uncomfortable to ask someone if they want cash or something else. They look at you like it’s a trick question. ” But at the time, distributing cash aid in a country with little to no banking infrastructure outside major cities would have required an extraordinary amount of manpower, not to mention introducing the risk of robbery and graft. But   mobile phones with     minutes began flooding into   African markets in the 2000s. Enterprising Ghanaians, Kenyans and Nigerians started to use their minutes as a kind of currency. In 2007, Vodafone and the British Department for International Development together built a system, called   for Kenyans to transfer actual shillings from cellphone to cellphone. An estimated 96 percent of Kenyan households use the system today. Faye and Niehaus  —   along with their friends Rohit Wanchoo and Jeremy Shapiro, also graduate students  —   thought about setting up a website to raise cash in the United States and send it directly to poor Kenyans. But they never found a nonprofit that would distribute that cash abroad. They decided to do it themselves in 2008. “Because it was a   and we started in grad school,” Faye said, “we were open to the idea of it being wrong or failing. ” The following year, Faye traveled to small Kenyan villages during the summer break, offering cash to whoever seemed poor and would take it. (The money, about $5, 000, came out of the foursome’s own pockets.) That, surprisingly, worked well enough to give them the confidence to start a threadbare randomized control trial the year they graduated. It found that the recipients, who received an average of $500, saw excellent outcomes: Their children were 42 percent less likely to go a whole day without eating.   rates dropped, and mental health improved. In time, the nonprofit attracted the attention of Silicon Valley and its   young philanthropists. Two Facebook founders gave   donations. Then, in the spring of 2012, Faye went to a friend’s brunch in Brooklyn and met someone working for Google. org, the tech giant’s giving arm. She liked the sound of GiveDirectly and arranged for Faye and Niehaus to give a presentation at Google’s headquarters in Mountain View, Calif. The company ended up contributing $2. 4 million. At first, GiveDirectly handed out large lump sums, generally $1, 000 spread into three payments over the course of the year. The nonprofit’s field officers would locate   villages in Kenya, then find the poorest families in each individual village using a simple asset test (whether a family had a thatched roof or not). The field officers would introduce themselves to the town elders, explain their purpose and return to provide mobile phones and training to recipient families. Then GiveDirectly would push a button and send the money out. On a steaming October morning, I went with two GiveDirectly executives, Joanna Macrae and Ian Bassin, to visit one of the villages that had received GiveDirectly’s   payments. We took off at dawn from Kisumu, a bustling industrial city on the banks of Lake Victoria, and followed a   highway to Bondo, a small trading city filled with cattle, bicycles and roadside food stands. From there, we turned inland from the lake and drove into a lush agricultural region. The residents of this village had received money in 2013, and it was visibly better off than the   pilot village. Its clearings were filled with mango plantings, its cows sturdy. A small lake on the outskirts had been lined with nets for catching fish. “Could you imagine sitting in an office in London or New York trying to figure out what this village needs?” Bassin said as he admired a   cow tied up by the lakeside. “It would just be impossible. ” Perhaps, but delivering money by   has some downsides, too. We visited an older woman named Anjelina Akoth Ngalo, her joints painful and swollen with advanced malaria. Sitting in her   hut, she told us that she had received only one payment, not the three that she was promised. She had given her phone to a woman in a nearby village who transferred the money out of it. Ngalo visited the village elder to try to get her money back, but nothing had come of it. She was now destitute, living on about $5 a week. She had not eaten since the day before, and she had run out of malaria medication. (Bassin said that less than 1 percent of recipients experience theft, crime or conflict.) By giving money to some but not all, the organization had unwittingly strained the social fabric of some of these   tribal communities. One man we visited in a separate village nearby, Nicolus Owuor Otin, had acted as a liaison between the community and the GiveDirectly staff, showing them where different families’ houses were, for instance. For that reason, he said, the other villagers thought he was determining who would get what and threatened to burn his house down. Still, nearly all the recipients described the money as transformative. Fredrick Omondi Auma  —   a Burning Spear devotee wearing a   hat and bell bottoms when we visited  —   had been impoverished, drinking too much, abandoned by his wife and living in a mud hut when GiveDirectly knocked on his door. He used his money to buy a motorbike to give taxi rides. He also started a small business, selling soap, salt and paraffin in a local town center he bought two cows, one of which had given birth and he opened a barbershop in the coastal city Mombasa. His income had gone from 600 shillings a week to 2, 500 shillings  —   roughly $25, a princely sum for the area. His wife had returned. He had even stopped drinking as much. “I used to go out drinking with 1, 000 shillings, and I’d wake up in the bar with 100 shillings,” he said. “Now I go out drinking with 1, 000 shillings, and I wake up at home with 900. ” “I didn’t imagine I would be living in an   house,” he said, referring to his roof. “I didn’t imagine I’d be wearing nice shoes. I didn’t imagine I would have a business, and earnings from it. I didn’t imagine I would be a man who owns cattle. ” Many popular forms of aid have been shown to work abysmally. PlayPumps  —       contraptions that let children pump water from underground wells as they play  —   did little to improve access to clean water.    programs have saddled families with animals inappropriate to their environment. Skills training and microfinance, one 2015 World Bank study found, “have shown little impact on poverty or stability, especially relative to program cost. ” All across the villages of western Kenya, it was clear to me just how much aid money was wasted on unnecessary stuff. The villagers had too many jerrycans and water tanks, because a nongovernmental organization kept bringing them. There was a thriving trade in Toms canvas  : People received them free from NGO workers and then turned around and sold them in the market centers. And none of the aid groups that had visited the villages managed to help the very poorest families. In the   village, for example, Faye and I paid a visit to a woman named Caroline Akinyi Odhiambo, who lives in a mud hut on the edge of town with her husband, Jack, a laborer, and her two small children. The most expensive thing she ever bought, she told me, was a chicken for 500 shillings, or about $5. Her family was persistently hungry. She knew of three nonprofit groups that had helped the village before GiveDirectly. One aided families with school fees, but it chose not to help her children. “I do not want to talk about it,” she said. What is worse, Faye told me, walking away from Odhiambo’s hut, was that most nonprofit projects in the region were never subject to anything like an impact assessment, either. There is no way to know how well they are working, or whether that money would be better spent on something else. “The question should always be: Would we be better off just giving this money away as cash?” Faye said. “There usually is not a way to answer that question. ” A vast majority of aid  —   94 percent  —   is noncash. Donor resistance is one reason for this it is not easy to persuade American oligarchs, British inheritors and Japanese industrialists to fork over their money to the extremely poor to use as they see fit. “There’s the usual worries about welfare dependency, the whole ‘Give a man a fish’ thing,” said Amanda Glassman, a public health and development expert at the Center for Global Development. “It’s so powerful. It’s really a basic psychological feature of the landscape. You’ll start drinking. You’ll start lying around at home because you’re getting paid. ” Cash also seems harder to market. American taxpayers might be perfectly happy to fund education for young women in poor countries or vaccinations for schoolchildren. But they might balk at the idea of showering money on poor, unstable countries. “The visual of putting a pill in a kid’s mouth is so much more attractive to people,” Glassman said. Institutional inertia is another factor. “There are a lot of good people working in the system,” Niehaus said. “And there are a lot of organizations pushing to do cash transfers. But the way they are structured and incentivized from the top down  —   they aren’t structured to do it. They have a specific mandate, like health. Cash transfers give choice of what goal to pursue to the recipients. ” Moreover, cash might force aid workers and nongovernmental organizations to confront the fact that they could be doing better by doing things differently  —   often by doing less. “It’s easy to muster evidence that you should be giving cash instead of fertilizer,” said Justin Sandefur of the Center for Global Development. “The harder argument is: You should shut down your U. S. A. I. D. program, which is bigger than the education budget of Liberia, and give the money to Liberians. That’s the radical critique. ” Faye put it more bluntly, if  : If cash transfers flourished, “the whole aid industry would have to fire itself. ” There is something to that. One estimate, generated by Laurence Chandy and Brina Seidel of the Brookings Institution, recently calculated that the global poverty gap  —   meaning how much it would take to get everyone above the poverty line  —   was just $66 billion. That is roughly what Americans spend on lottery tickets every year, and it is about half of what the world spends on foreign aid. In the   village, the residents had just started to work through how transformative the program would be, what they could do with the money and how different their lives could feel in 12 years. Detractors often say that no one would work in a world with a basic income, that the safety net could grow a bit too comfortable. Ultimately, what a universal income would do to workers in the rich world will remain a mystery until someone tries it out. But here, many villagers were concerned primarily with procuring the sustenance and basic comforts that their penury had denied them. Odhiambo, the woman who had not been offered aid by the school group, planned to buy corrugated iron sheets for her roof she considered possibly paying off her dowry. Another villager, Pamela Aooko Odero, ran a household that had been suffering from hunger, with all eight of them living on just 500 to 1, 000 shillings a week. She took her money as soon as she got it and went to buy food. Many more made plans that were entrepreneurial. Two widowed   Margaret Aloma Abagi and Mary Abonyo Abagi, told me they planned to pool their funds together to start a small bank with some friends. Charles Omari Ager, a houseboy for the   had his phone turned off and wrapped in a plastic bag in his pocket when the first text came in. He was driving the widows’ goats and cattle from one     meadow to another when he happened upon an aid worker, who prompted him to pull out his phone, turn it on and wait. The text was there. The money was there. “I’m happy! I’m happy! I’m happy!” he said. He bought himself a goat that day. When he got his money, Erick Odhiambo Madoho walked to the   local highway nearest the village and took a matatu, a shared minibus, overloaded with 20 passengers, down to Lake Victoria. There he found an   stand and converted his mobile money into shillings. He used the cash to buy the first of three rounds of   fishing line that he would need to   into nets to catch tilapia in the lake. When the nets were done, he told me, he would rent a boat and hire a day laborer to work with him. He anticipated that his income, after costs, might reach as much as 2, 000 shillings on a good day. I asked him why he hadn’t saved money for nets beforehand. He shrugged, smiled and said, “I could not. ”	1
310	MOSCOW  —   Russia’s Foreign Ministry got into the fake news business in a splashy way on Wednesday. No, not by creating it. That dark art seems to emanate from other, even more opaque branches of the Russian government. Rather, Maria V. Zakharova, the spokeswoman for the ministry, unveiled a new section on its website meant to highlight articles that it considers to be fake news, including one by The New York Times. Just in case anybody missed the point, each article on the Foreign Ministry website carried a big red label reading “FAKE” in English and a line saying that the information in the article “does not correspond to reality. ” Russia actually announced something of a fake news double whammy, since the defense minister, Sergei K. Shoigu, told Parliament on Wednesday that the military had created a special task force assigned to wage information warfare, although he did not provide any details. That was no surprise to officials in the United States and Europe, who have been grappling with the Kremlin’s information warfare for at least the last two years. The Foreign Ministry’s new venture in singling out fake news seemed to fit a pattern identified by many analysts of creating alternative realities meant to sow confusion in people’s minds, in that way discrediting all news sources. It was hard for some critics to take the ministry’s fake news detector seriously, and some suggested that inclusion there was something of a badge of honor, an indication that the article had hit close to home. The Foreign Ministry has become a propaganda wing serving the Kremlin rather than a diplomatic service that establishes foreign policy, said Alexei A. Venediktov, the longtime editor of the respected Echo of Moscow radio station. “You shouldn’t worry at all,” he said, but should instead consider being singled out by the Foreign Ministry to be an honor “like a medal. ” Ms. Zakharova introduced the fake news section during her weekly, nationally televised briefing. “We will publish examples of propaganda hoaxes from various media outlets and give links to sources,” she said. “The aim is to demonstrate the main trends in fake news publications about our country and do everything to stop their dissemination. ” It was not immediately clear what criteria the ministry would apply in its effort to identify what it considered to be fake news, and Ms. Zakharova declined to answer questions beyond what she said at her briefing. The spokeswoman emphasized that the Foreign Ministry would consider the news fake when it failed to include Russian reaction or the Russian position on the issue. News published from unidentified sources that constituted opinion or unverified fact also qualified, according to Ms. Zakharova. The initiative appeared to be a reaction to widespread reporting over the past year focused on fake news emanating from Russia. Ms. Zakharova outlined an appeal process, noting that news organizations could ask to have their work removed. “Russia is being accused of doing this, but how can you accuse us of disseminating untrue information by government agencies and the media while you are doing the same against Russia?” Ms. Zakharova said. “While publishing information about Russia, the world media is doing the same thing  —   they never cite concrete facts  —   this is a sad paradox. ” There is a rather distinct gap between what Russia is accused of disseminating and what it labeled “fake news. ” After Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 from Amsterdam was shot down over Ukraine in July 2014, killing all 298 civilians on board, for example, local rebel commanders at first bragged about shooting down an aircraft at the very spot. When the extent of the tragedy emerged, Russia went into overdrive pumping out alternative versions, most of them fanciful and most blaming Ukraine. One such version suggested that it was a failed attempt to shoot down President Vladimir V. Putin’s jet, which was aloft at the same time. A   investigation concluded that the powerful    missile system that took down the airliner had been trucked in from Russia at the request of   separatists and returned over the border the same night. As tensions with Europe escalated over the past several years, all sorts of false news stories emerged. State news media and Russian officials falsely claimed that a    Russian immigrant in Germany had been kidnapped and raped, for example, and websites linked to Russia spread rumors, like one that Sweden had been approached to sell weapons to female fighters for the Islamic State. The stories that Russia labeled “fake news” were certainly more mainstream fare. The initial offerings included five articles from various large organizations including The New York Times, Bloomberg, The Daily Telegraph and NBC News. Indicating that its reach would be wide, however, one article was included from the Santa Monica Observer in California, about the sudden deaths of a number of Russian diplomats in recent months. Seemingly borrowing a practice from President Trump, Russia appears to be labeling as fake any articles it dislikes. The one from Bloomberg, for example, quoted Richard Ferrand, the chief of Emmanuel Macron’s presidential campaign in France, as accusing Russia of carrying out cyberattacks against the campaign. It quoted Dmitri S. Peskov, Russia’s presidential spokesman, as denying any link. The New York Times article, by a veteran national security reporter and former Moscow correspondent, Michael R. Gordon, detailed concerns in the American administration about Russian violations of a nuclear arms treaty. The story quoted unidentified officials as well as experts in the field, and it noted Russian criticism of some aspects of the treaty. A spokeswoman for The Times strongly defended the article and criticized the practice of simply labeling news reports fake without any substantiating evidence. “It’s a dangerous and troubling situation for governments or individuals to simply assign the label of fake news to a story they don’t like, instead of challenging specific facts or offering counter evidence,” said Eileen Murphy, the spokeswoman. “We stand by our reporting. ” Russian social media erupted with a certain amount of derision about the whole enterprise, particularly since the link in Russian to the page translated as “publications and refutations. ” “So to slap a red stamp and grandly say that something is ‘fake’  —   this is what they call refutation these days?” wrote one Russian man on Facebook. A reporter for the   Moscow Times asked via Twitter whether he could borrow the big red stamp. Ms. Zakharova said that the ministry would not be assessing Russian news media for fake news. It deals with foreign relations, she noted.	1
955	 First Lady Melania Trump demanded the White House undergo a complete exorcism, with “pagan idols and demonic artifacts” from “the Clinton and Obama years” removed from the premises before she would set foot in the building, according to White House pastor Paul Begley.“I’m not going to go into that White House unless it has been completely exorcised,” Melania Trump told Pastor Begley.“They cleansed the White House,” the pastor said. “They had people in there anointing it with oil and praying everywhere.”After the First Lady had finished removing pagan and demonic items, only one thing was left — a cross on the wall. The White House is now free of all pagan gods and idols, and contains only Christian iconography.  CNSNews.com contacted Pastor Paul Begley and asked for more information about the spiritual cleansing. Begley said his source for the story was close to “those working in the White House” and requested that he (or she) not be named.In an email to CNSNews.com, Pastor Begley said, ” I was not there, but a close source to those working in the White House revealed to me that the ‘Spiritual Cleaning’ did take place before the First Lady would feel comfortable living at the White House. All religious artifacts from former administrations were removed except for 1 cross on 1 wall in the White House. Also Prayer Meetings were established in the White House for prayer and devotions. I was requested to (not reveal my source).” The Clintons’ enthrallment has lasted for more than 30 years. They decorated their homes with Haitian art.	0
542	 The FBI today released the final text message sent out by Omar Mateen to his wife just two hours after he started his attack at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando that killed 49 people and injured 53 others. In the text, Mateen said, “I’m gay. I hate myself, and that’s why I’m doing this.”The Muslim gunman who committed the Pulse nightclub massacre in Orlando, was “100 percent” gay and bore a grudge against Latino men because he felt used by them, according to a man who says he was his lover for two months.“I’ve cried like you have no idea. But the thing that makes me want to tell the truth is that he didn’t do it for terrorism. In my opinion he did it for revenge,” he told Univision Noticias anchor Maria Elena Salinas in an exclusive interview in English and Spanish.	0
434	Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the  .) The Democrats’ power in the State Capitol is ironclad. And it was wielded in startling fashion last week when a Republican state senator defied a demand to stop speaking and was physically removed from the Senate floor by law enforcement. The senator, Janet Nguyen, had stood up to criticize Tom Hayden, the 1960s radical, over his opposition to the Vietnam War. Days earlier, Mr. Hayden had been honored in the Capitol for his service in the Legislature. He died in October. But as Ms. Nguyen, who fled Communist Vietnam as a child, was speaking, the presiding senator declared her out of order. When she refused to sit, he summoned the   . “Have her removed immediately,” said the senator, Ricardo Lara, a Democrat. If the plan was to silence Ms. Nguyen, it backfired. Captured on video, the commotion drew wide news coverage. Republicans circulated their outrage on social media, with some adopting the #shepersisted hashtag that became a rallying cry after Senator Elizabeth Warren was herself cut off during a speech. At the California Republican Party’s convention over the weekend, Ms. Nguyen was held up as a symbol of free speech. Hundreds of stickers were printed that read: “I stand with Janet. ” “It’s unknowable for us why they wouldn’t allow it,” Jean Fuller, the Senate Republican leader, said of the action against Ms. Nguyen. Some Democrats accused Ms. Nguyen of having violated parliamentary rules. Mr. Lara declined through a spokesman to offer specifics. On Monday, Kevin de León, the Senate president pro tempore, addressed the controversy on the Senate floor, saying he was “troubled” by what happened. “Thursday was not one of the finest moments in the Senate’s history,” he said. “As the leader of this body, I take full responsibility for what transpired and for making sure it never happens again. ” That may not be enough for Republicans who are calling for an investigation. “My constituents are extremely upset,” said Ms. Nguyen, who represents a part of Orange County with a large Vietnamese population. “They’re upset that their voices were shut down. ” Even so, as happened with Ms. Warren, Ms. Nguyen’s   speech got far more attention than it otherwise would have.

[San Diego  ] It was “the worst party ever. ” That’s how Bill Schutt, author of the gripping new book “Cannibalism: A Perfectly Natural History,” titled his chapter on the Donner Party tragedy. In the summer of 1846, a group of 87 pioneers set out from Missouri to settle the California coast. Led by George Donner, a businessman with no trail experience, the group took a misguided shortcut that in fact put them weeks behind schedule. Still, by late October, they stood before the final mountain pass in the Sierra Nevada, just a day or two from civilization on the other side. They rested for the night. And in a stroke of colossally bad luck, disaster hit. It snowed. They were stuck. Through the winter months, the group descended into starvation, madness and, infamously, cannibalism. The last survivor, found surrounded by half eaten corpses, wasn’t rescued until  . All told, 35 died during the winter encampment or trying to escape it. We caught up with Mr. Schutt, who is a professor of biology at Long Island University, by phone. Some excerpts from the conversation: Q. I get the sense that your book tries to normalize cannibalism. Is that right? A. That’s a fine line to walk. If you’re not careful it sounds like you’re condoning that behavior. And I’m not. What I’m doing is taking a look at it through the eyes of a zoologist, of a scientist. . .. When looking at survival cannibalism like the Donners, I’m not trying to normalize that, I’m trying to say that it’s predictable behavior. Q. What did you learn about human nature researching this story? A. Just how strong and rugged these people were.   …     They showed incredible bravery all along the way.

579	 A five-year-old boy is being consoled by his family after his missing hamster, Teddy Bear, was found dead in the back-fat of his 700 pound mother. Michelle Wiggins, 31, was hauled to the emergency room by her sister when complaints of a foul smell had them concerned that one of her bedsores may have been of infected.However, when examined by the emergency room doctor, Wiggins bedsores were the least of her family’s problems. With her 5 year-old son present, Dr. Timothy Murphy examined the obese woman, feeling an odd “lump” within the folds of her back-fat. When the doctor lifted the skin to examine the area, he was astonished to find a dead rodent decomposing on her skin. According to the doctor, the hamster had been there so long, one of Wiggins sores began to heal around the rodent, sealing it into her skin. This created the foul smell that was emanating from her body.Unfortunately for the little boy, he witnessed the entire incident of Teddy Bear being removed from his mother’s back fat. 	0

Investigators say Bobby’s cell mate Antwan Mauldin, 29, stabbed Bobby Shmurda to death with a hidden pocket knife. Although authorities are not sure what caused Mauldin to murder Bobby, it is believed Bobby Shmurda’s song lyrics and rap personality might have played a role.Bobby Shmurda was jailed on December 17 of 2014 for conspiracy of murder and weapon charges, and reckless endangerment as part of a 15-person, 69-count indictment that included fellow GS9 label-mate Rowdy Rebel. Bobby was being held at Rikers Island jail in New York City at the time of his murder. Although pleaded not guilty, Bobby was scheduled to remain in jail for christmas. The 20 year old rapper was known for his popular hit singles “Hot N*gga” and “Bobby B*tch”, as well as introducing the popular “Shmoney Dance”.	0
169	(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the  .) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. President Trump, in his fourth tumultuous week in office, boasted that his new administration was a “  machine. ” A news conference to announce his new nominee for labor secretary, R. Alexander Acosta, a former assistant attorney general for civil rights, turned into an extraordinarily raw and angry  . “The tone is such hatred,” he said of cable TV commentary. “I’m really not a bad person. ” _____ 2. Representative Mick Mulvaney of South Carolina was confirmed as budget director. He is a fiscal hawk who will play a central role in the administration’s plans to reshape the federal government. But Mr. Trump’s nominee to lead the Environmental Protection Agency, Scott Pruitt, heads to a confirmation vote Friday amid an extraordinary wave of protest from former E. P. A. staff members. Such   confirmation battles have helped make Republican lawmakers unable to deliver on their promises of sweeping legislation on health care, overhauling the tax code or upgrading the nation’s infrastructure. They are particularly fractured on how to repeal and replace Obamacare. _____ 3. An uncounted number of immigrants across the country  —   carpenters and cooks, students, cleaners and grocery store owners  —   stayed home in protest of the Trump administration’s immigration policies. “We’re at a stage where we’re like, what else is there to do except organize and boycott?” said an activist in New York. The Justice Department said it would not seek a rehearing on the president’s targeted travel ban in a federal appeals court, saying a new order was in the works. _____ 4. Intelligence officials, on edge over Mr. Trump’s criticism of leaks related to his associates’   contacts with Russian intelligence agents, are resisting his plans to assign Stephen A. Feinberg, a New York billionaire, to review intelligence agencies. That Russian naval intelligence ship hanging off the East Coast? For some, it’s a symbol of current tensions, but the Coast Guard says there’s nothing all that unusual about it. Today’s episode of the podcast The Daily asks, did the Trump campaign collude with Russia? Listen from a computer, on an iOS device or on an Android device. _____ 5. In environmental news, a Greenpeace report tied the toxic waves of air pollution sweeping northern China to an increase in already excessive steel production last year, made counter to promised cuts. Scientists are also coming to understand the crucial importance of the vast, and endangered, seagrass meadows that surround every continent except Antarctica. _____ 6. The Islamic State has destroyed many of the prized antiquities and ruins in the Syrian city of Palmyra. But a new digital exhibition is helping preserve its legacy. The Getty has gathered   etchings of Palmyra and the oldest known photographs of the city. Most have not been seen widely before. “More than just testaments to a threatened archaeological inheritance,” our critic writes, they are “traces of explorations and crosscultural exchange too many now seek to shut down. ” _____ 7. Mark Zuckerberg updated Facebook’s mission statement in a   letter that was close to a political statement from the    executive. He expressed alarm over growing rejections of globalism and argued that “progress now requires humanity coming together not just as cities or nations, but also as a global community. ” And Snap Inc. Snapchat’s parent company, is aiming for a valuation of more than $20 billion as it nears what’s expected to be the biggest initial public offering in the tech world since Alibaba and Facebook. _____ 8. You don’t need us to tell you the world is full of paradoxes. But one of our sports reporters found a special case: Hunts for bighorn sheep  —   prized as challenging, and prohibitively expensive  —   are helping revive wild sheep populations and expand their territory. A permit sold for a record $480, 000 in 2013. _____ 9.   TV continues to showcase jokes about the White House and Russia. Stephen Colbert took particular aim at Mr. Trump’s efforts to blame the leakers who revealed Trump associates’ contacts with Russian intelligence over the last year. “Here’s the thing,” Mr. Colbert said. “It can’t be both fake news and an illegal leak of classified information. ‘Your honor, I did not murder that man. The real criminal is whoever filmed me strangling him. ’” _____ 10. Finally, the announcement of a double jailhouse wedding more than a century ago got Lena Dunham thinking about what it means to love and to be a “good woman. ” The notice is part of our review of 165 years of Times wedding announcements. In a turnabout, it was the women who were incarcerated. They were serving short sentences, but the 1912 article made no mention of their infractions. The grooms, the creator of HBO’s “Girls” writes, were able to get beyond societal expectations of the brides’ behavior: “They didn’t need them to be good girls. They were their girls. ” Photographs may appear out of order for some readers. Viewing this version of the briefing should help. Your Evening Briefing is posted at 6 p. m. Eastern.

280	(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the  .) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. The Trump administration detailed plans to deport millions of immigrants, a major shift in enforcement policy that is expected to face resistance from many states and dozens of   sanctuary cities. The new Homeland Security rules authorize the expulsion of undocumented immigrants who commit even minor offenses, and make it easier to deport people immediately. This is how deportation works, step by step. Immigration will be high on the agenda as Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson and the secretary of homeland security, John F. Kelly, visit Mexico this week. _____  2. President Trump spoke out for the first time about the rise in incidents and threats targeting Jews and Jewish institutions, calling   “horrible,” and “painful. ” He said the venue for his comments, the National Museum of African American History and Culture, was “a meaningful reminder of why we have to fight bigotry, intolerance and hatred in all of its very ugly forms. ” A day earlier, his daughter Ivanka Trump, who has converted to Judaism, called for protections as nearly a dozen Jewish community centers across the country received bomb threats by phone. Above, a Jewish cemetery in St. Louis where nearly 200 headstones were toppled over the weekend. _____ 3. Republicans home for the congressional recess have been greeted with an earful at town   meetings. Those who scheduled no meetings faced criticism that they were ducking constituents. In Iowa, a pig farmer (and Democrat) furious over the possible repeal of Obamacare gave Senator Charles Grassley a bottle of Tums. “You’re going to need ’em the next few years,” he said, drawing laughs from the crowd. _____ 4. Milo Yiannopoulos, the   provocateur who incited a storm of criticism for condoning sex with boys, left Breitbart News. His explanation of the comments, in a video that surfaced over the weekend, as “British sarcasm, provocation and gallows humor” appeared to sway few. He also lost a book deal and a speaking engagement at the Conservative Political Action Conference. _____ 5. A riot in an immigrant neighborhood in Sweden was seized upon by Trump supporters as validation of his claims  —   based on a Fox News feature  —   that the European country had experienced a surge in crime and violence linked to refugees. Preliminary statistics do not show a major increase in crime from 2015, when Sweden processed a record 163, 000 asylum applications, to 2016, and Mr. Trump’s assertions baffled Swedes. The country’s interior minister said of the clash that making “suburbs and socially vulnerable areas safer” could “get a little messy. ” _____ 6. Trinidad and Tobago is scrambling to stop young Muslims from going to Syria to take up arms for the Islamic State. Per capita, the Caribbean island nation has the largest number of foreign fighters from the Western Hemisphere who have joined the militant group, according to John L. Estrada, a former U. S. ambassador there. “Trinidadians do very well with ISIL,” he said. “They are high up in the ranks, they are very respected and they are  . ISIL have used them for propaganda to spread their message through the Caribbean. ” _____ 7. Political dissent is simmering in the art world. More than 65 writers, artists and actors published an open letter opposing Mr. Trump’s efforts to bar people from seven predominantly Muslim countries. And if history is any guide, at least some of the stars at the Oscars this Sunday will criticize Mr. Trump’s approach to immigration and other issues. Above, Meryl Streep’s impassioned speech at the Golden Globes. _____ 8. Mardi Gras is next Tuesday, and a small family brewery in the bayou country of southern Louisiana is ready. Bayou Teche Brewing, known for some of the most distinctive craft beers in the United States, is preparing a special drink for the old Cajun version of the holiday. Men dress in handmade costumes and traverse town on horseback, begging for ingredients for a communal gumbo. The beer  —   wheaty, slightly hoppy and high in alcohol  —   pairs well with the gumbo, and the style is celebratory, for the arrival of spring. _____ 9. Scientists are suddenly questioning how well we know our cosmos. Recent measurements of the distances and velocities of faraway galaxies don’t agree with a   “standard model” of the cosmos that has prevailed for the past two decades. One expert said the news, while disruptive, could be “just what the younger generation wants  —   a chance for big discoveries, new insights and breakthroughs. ” _____ 10. Finally, we’ve been rummaging through our archive of 165 years of Times wedding announcements. To conclude the project, we offer this vision of what we might be printing (O. K. publishing on some kind of futuristic platform) 165 years from now: “At first I was just attracted to how hot he looked in his robokini,” Ms. Bezos said. “I’m looking forward to being together for all the years and software upgrades to come. ” _____ Photographs may appear out of order for some readers.

269	It’s raining in California. Again. A storm system hitting north and central California on Monday and Tuesday will deliver two to three inches of rain to the Central Valley, and up to 10 inches of rain to the mountains, said Eric Kurth, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Sacramento. The service has issued a flood warning through Wednesday across most of the Sacramento River Valley and the surrounding areas. It is the latest in a string of storms this winter that have dropped an unusually high amount of water on the state, which had spent more than five years under dire drought conditions. “On its own, this system wouldn’t be much of a concern,” Mr. Kurth said. “But we have elevated stream levels, river levels. We are seeing some of the rivers up at flood levels. ” Last week, more than 180, 000 residents were ordered to evacuate from below the Oroville Dam when a damaged emergency spillway and a swollen reservoir raised concerns about a collapse. Crews rushed to fix the damaged embankment at the dam, 70 miles north of Sacramento, and to prepare it for more rain. On Saturday, a storm with winds near hurricane strength swept through Southern California, killing at least two people, flooding roads and triggering mudslides. A sinkhole in Studio City swallowed a car. Interstate 5 in the central Sacramento Valley was flooded briefly over the weekend. “That was an area that typically we don’t see much flooding,” Mr. Kurth said. “But things are so saturated. ” Across the northern part of the state, swollen rivers were lapping over their banks and reservoirs were close to flood stage. The National Weather Service reported nearly a dozen rivers were at their flood stage on Sunday. The San Joaquin River was at “danger stage” on Sunday and nearing the top of its levees at a measuring station near Vernalis, Tim Daly, a spokesman with San Joaquin County Office of Emergency Services, told The Associated Press. In Colusa County, about 60 miles north of Sacramento, Jim Saso, the assistant sheriff, told The A. P. that he was warning residents to be prepared for evacuation. “We’re telling those people to keep a bag close by and get ready to leave again,” he said. The Don Pedro Reservoir in Tuolumne County, southeast of Sacramento, was at 826 feet on Sunday  —   four feet below its flood level, CBS 13 reported. Authorities were preparing to release water through its spillway as early as Monday afternoon, the first time in 20 years that would have happened, CBS 13 said. The ultimate effect of the storm depends on how much of the moisture lands as rain in the valleys as opposed to snow higher up in the mountains, Mr. Kurth said. “That set of storms previously that brought a lot of trouble, the issues with the Oroville Dam, that system was very warm,” he said. This storm is not quite as warm, meaning that some of the higher amounts of moisture could be in the form of snow in the mountains and would not affect the rivers immediately. “If we get water locked up in the form of snowpack and that stays through the spring, we get a gradual water flow into the spring months and maybe into the summer,” he said. “If we get it all in the form of rain, maybe like those other storms, it’s all running down into the streams and maybe into the rivers causing some flooding. ” “We do need water. Water is good. But it’s better in the form of snow,” he said. This latest storm is what’s called an “atmospheric river”  —   a weather event more commonly known as the “pineapple express. ” It is moist tropical air from the central Pacific trapped in a band between different pressure systems, Mr. Kurth said. When it hits California, it unleashes a high amount of rain. “It’s like a fire hose of moisture when we get these atmospheric rivers,” he said. An atmospheric river is not especially unusual. “We usually get a couple every year,” he said. “On average we get maybe three to five or so. This year we’ve gotten quite a few more. ” How many more? “More than a dozen prior to this one,” he said. This storm also brings “pretty strong winds,” which could potentially top 60 miles an hour on Monday evening, Mr. Kurth said. The wind, when combined with the oversaturated ground, means that trees tend to topple more frequently  —   and when they do, they often take powers lines with them. Or they fall across highways, snarling traffic in regions that were spared flooding. ”I’ve seen more of that this year than I’ve ever seen by far,” Mr. Kurth said. The saturation also leaves areas vulnerable to mudslides. “Major arteries over the Sierras have been blocked for long periods of time, and I expect we’ll see much more of that today, too,” he said. California has been in a drought for more than five years, resulting in mandatory conservation. Reservoirs were parched, and the snowpack that helps feed the state’s rivers and streams with its spring thaw had been nearly nonexistent at times. But this year has brought a tremendous amount of rain and snow, and that has helped. “You would be   to say we have a surface water drought right now,” Jay Lund, a water expert at the University of California, Davis, told The New York Times last week. Aided by the recent storms, the snowpack for the central Sierra mountains was at 182 percent of its normal level on Sunday. And the United States Drought Monitor reported that nearly 44 percent of the state was free of a drought warning last week, compared to less than 1 percent at this time a year ago. But that still leaves more than 20 million people that it estimates are living in an area affected by drought, the monitor reported. The brunt of this storm will hit on Monday and Tuesday, Mr. Kurth said, with showers continuing on Wednesday. Thursday will be “relatively dry,” he said, but warned of another potential storm arriving on Friday or Saturday. “We’re not going to see a real   period. Maybe just a day or two,” he said.	1
166	JERUSALEM  —   The huge billboard images appeared overnight in Tel Aviv: a menacing crowd of Palestinians making the V for victory sign and bearing a legend in Arabic, “Soon we will be the majority. ” One interpretation of that inevitability was explained in Hebrew for those who dialed the number on the billboard: If Israel does not act to separate itself from the Palestinians, it will be less secure, less democratic and less Jewish. The provocative  —   many said racist  —   campaign was kicked off last month by retired Israeli generals and senior officers to shake Israelis out of apathy. President Trump accomplished something similar over the course of just a few seconds on Wednesday, when, standing beside Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House, he declared that he was “looking at   and  ” formulas for resolving the   conflict. “I like the one that both parties like,” he added, seemingly overturning decades of American policy centered on the creation of a Palestinian state alongside Israel. Purposefully or not, Mr. Trump had suddenly implied that the   solution of two states did not really matter. By Thursday, Israelis and Palestinians were feverishly debating what might come next, still confused about American policy after Mr. Trump’s ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki R. Haley, reasserted that the administration “absolutely” supported two states. What were the viable options other than the   solution? One state with equal rights for both Israelis and Palestinians? A dominant Israeli state alongside a defined Palestinian region with statelike but curtailed powers? Would either side ever settle for less than everything? Over decades, Palestinians have watched Jewish settlements spread over land they consider theirs for a future state and concluded that Israel did not intend to concede it. Many of them, particularly those in Hamas, which rules the Gaza Strip, still do not recognize Israel at all. Many Israelis believe that they have repeatedly made good offers that were refused, and that Palestinians are irrevocably split between the West Bank and Gaza, with no unified leadership to negotiate with. Good will, they say, has been met by rocket fire. Now, the Israeli political establishment, moving rightward, clearly believes it is the time to put its thumb on the scale. “I think what the president and prime minister were saying was any solution is possible and now we have to look at alternative solutions, and there are alternative solutions,” said Michael Oren, a deputy minister for diplomacy in Mr. Netanyahu’s office. These, Mr. Oren told reporters, could involve “interim measures and recognition of the fact that there may be a   reality on the ground, which may not conform to what we know as a   solution, but would enable the Palestinians to lead their lives in prosperity and security”  —   and also benefit Israel. Mr. Netanyahu, weakened by corruption investigations and under pressure from   politicians who oppose a Palestinian state, has recently been evasive about his support for a   solution. It depended, he said in Washington, on what the Palestinians had in mind: “What are we talking about? Are we talking about Costa Rica, or are we talking about another Iran?” Mostly, Mr. Netanyahu appears to want to solidify Israeli control over the occupied West Bank and manage the conflict. That basically means maintaining the current situation of Palestinian cantons divided by growing Israeli settlements and surrounded by Israeli forces. Mr. Netanyahu has referred to it as a “ ”  —   implying the Palestinians would get some statelike autonomy, and that would be enough. Critics call it a creeping   reality, and certainly not the “ultimate deal” that Mr. Trump says he hopes to achieve. Some analysts chalk up Mr. Trump’s flippancy to a lack of knowledge, because one thing many Palestinians and Israelis do agree on is that a   formula will not bring peace. “One state is not an option,” said Ghassan Khatib, a Palestinian political scientist at Birzeit University in the West Bank, noting that Israel, which was established to give Jews   would never give all Palestinians the vote. “We are talking two states or no solution, a continuation of the status quo,” he said. Shaul Arieli, an Israeli expert on political geography who prepared maps for past negotiations with the Palestinians and is a member of Commanders for Israel’s Security, the group behind the billboard campaign, said “one state is impossible” for Israel. Demographically and economically, absorbing millions of comparatively poor Palestinians would destroy it, he said. Results of a survey of Israelis and Palestinians released on Thursday, put out jointly by Tel Aviv University and Israeli and Palestinian research centers, indicated that 55 percent of Israelis still support the notion of a   solution, while support among the Palestinians dropped to 44 percent. But the numbers on both sides rose significantly when they were offered additional incentives like a broader regional peace between Israel and the Arab world. Among Palestinians, support rose for the ability to work freely in Israel even after the establishment of an independent state. The survey included a representative sample of 1, 270 Palestinians and 1, 207 Israelis. Israelis are increasingly fearful of the prospect of a Palestinian state at their doorstep. They see other areas of the Middle East in chaos. After Israel unilaterally left the Gaza Strip in 2005, they watched as the militant group Hamas, which rejects Israel’s existence, seized full control of the territory after winning legislative elections. And they know that without the West Bank, Israel is just nine miles wide at its narrowest point. There is also the emotional issue for those who identify the West Bank as the heart of the biblical Jewish homeland promised by God. The Israeli idea of Palestinian statehood never included all of the attributes of full sovereignty. Israel insists on a demilitarized state, and Mr. Netanyahu says the Israeli military has to keep overall security control. Together with other    issues  —   like the fate of Jerusalem and of Palestinian refugees  —   many experts have long said that the maximum Israel can offer does not meet the minimum Palestinian requirements. Saeb Erekat, a senior Palestinian official, noted this week that the   solution “represents a painful and historic Palestinian compromise of recognizing Israel over 78 percent of historic Palestine. ” President Mahmoud Abbas of the Palestinian Authority, an interim government that has held sway in parts of the West Bank since the 1990s, is weakened by internal struggles and threatened by his rivals in Hamas. Mahmoud Zahar, a   member of Hamas and one of its founders in Gaza, said of Mr. Abbas in an interview this week: “He is wasting his time. He is wasting our time and helping the Israelis expand settlements. He is a traitor. He is a spy. ” When the former United States secretary of state, John Kerry, came up with a proposed framework accord defining the principles of a comprehensive   agreement after months of negotiations in 2014, Mr. Abbas did not respond. Since then, Israel has approved plans for thousands of new settler homes in the West Bank and East Jerusalem and has moved to retroactively legalize settler outposts that were built throughout the territory. The measures have further entrenched the occupation, now in its 50th year since Israel captured the territory from Jordan in the 1967 war. A growing number of   Israeli ministers, including from Mr. Netanyahu’s Likud Party, are pushing to annex the settlements that Israel intends to incorporate within its borders under any future deal. Israel has also invested heavily in roads and infrastructure connecting and serving the West Bank settlements, now home to some 400, 000 people. Yet supporters of the   solution insist it still could be executed. Both sides have recognized that it would require adjustments along the 1967 lines. Mr. Arieli, the political geographer, said Israel could keep 80 percent of its West Bank settlers within its borders by swapping territory equal to about 4 percent of the West Bank. Many of the remaining 20 percent of settlers  —   roughly 30, 000 families  —   would most likely agree to move back into Israel for compensation, he said. The numbers can also be deceptive, and some experts insist that much of the change on the ground in recent years can be reversed. About 50 percent of the growth of the settler population has come in two large   settlements, Modiin Illit and Beitar Illit. Both are considered swappable, being close to the 1967 line. Jews mostly went there for cheap housing, not ideology. Together, these two settlements have about 130, 000 residents  —   a third of the total settler population of the West Bank. In some more outlying settlements, Mr. Arieli said, the population was decreasing as Israelis were “voting with their feet” by not moving in, or moving out. Settlement leaders attribute the drop to pressure from the Obama administration that limited the construction of new homes. Mr. Khatib, of Birzeit University, agreed that a   solution was still physically possible “with some creativity, like swapping. ” But, he said, “It won’t remain so for long. ” What is lacking is political will of the leaders on both sides. Nahum Barnea, a leading Israeli columnist, wrote in the newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth on Thursday that if Mr. Trump were “slightly more informed,” he might have realized that it was not an issue of one state or two states: “The two sides, in practice, have chosen a third option: not to agree. ”	1
751	 The Center For Disease Control (CDC) is warning Americans that used condoms have been reportedly reprocessed into rubber bands and hair ties and have been sold in the United States, raising concerns about public health safety. Aside from being sold at local swap meets and flea markets, the recycled condoms have been found at local beauty salons all across the country. The CDC says this threatens the health of consumers who are using these products and are concerned that using these hair ties and rubber bands could lead to the spread of AIDS, genital warts and other STD’s.The CDC has released this statement:“The amount of bacteria and potential viruses on these hair ties and rubber bands, which are made from used unsanitary condoms, has 4 times the bacteria found on a public restroom toilet. Consumers could potentially be infected with AIDS, warts, herpes and other venereal diseases if they hold the rubber bands or hair ties in their mouths while setting their hair. We warn against consumers purchasing these products if they were made in China.” In November 2007, news emerged from China that some hair bands manufactured there were found to have been made from recycled condoms. The prophylactic hair ties were discovered in Dongguan and Guangzhou, two cities in the province of Guangdong. (The colorful hair bands were believed to have been manufactured in Jinhua, a city in the province of Zhejiang.) The “secret ingredient” came to light when a young woman in Dongguan thought to investigate the hair bands given to her in a local salon after one began to fray, revealing an unexpected color inside.“The hair bands are swathed in colorful wool-like materials,” said Ms. Chen, the woman who found the condoms. “But a small part came loose when I used the bands to tie my hair up one morning. It looked strange to me because of its different color — not the yellow color we normally see in plastic bands. I peeled deeper and found something that looked like a condom.”	0

349	COLONIA BERLIN, Bolivia  —   A few months ago, a representative from Cargill traveled to this remote colony in Bolivia’s eastern lowlands in the southernmost reaches of the vast Amazon River basin with an enticing offer. The American agricultural giant wanted to buy soybeans from the Mennonite residents, descendants of European peasants who had been carving settlements out of the thick forest for more than 40 years. The company would finance a local warehouse and weighing station so farmers could sell their produce directly to Cargill   the man said, according to local residents. One of those farmers, Heinrich Janzen, was clearing woodland from a   plot he bought late last year, hustling to get soy in the ground in time for a May harvest. “Cargill wants to buy from us,” said Mr. Janzen, 38, as bluish smoke drifted from heaps of smoldering vegetation. His soy is in demand. Cargill is one of several agricultural traders vying to buy from soy farmers in the region, he said. Cargill confirmed the accounts of colony residents, and said the company was still assessing whether it would source from the community. That decision would depend on a study of the area’s productivity and land titles, said Hugo Krajnc, Cargill’s corporate affairs leader for the Southern Cone, based in Argentina. “But if a farmer has burned down its forest we’ll not source from that grower,” he said. A decade after the “Save the Rainforest” movement forced changes that dramatically slowed deforestation across the Amazon basin, activity is roaring back in some of the biggest expanses of forests in the world. That resurgence, driven by the world’s growing appetite for soy and other agricultural crops, is raising the specter of a backward slide in efforts to preserve biodiversity and fight climate change. In the Brazilian Amazon, the world’s largest rain forest, deforestation rose in 2015 for the first time in nearly a decade, to nearly two million acres from August 2015 to July 2016. That is a jump from about 1. 5 million acres a year earlier and just over 1. 2 million acres the year before that, according to estimates by Brazil’s National Institute for Space Research. Here across the border in Bolivia, where there are fewer restrictions on land clearance, deforestation appears to be accelerating as well. About 865, 000 acres of land have been deforested, on average, annually for agriculture since 2011, according to estimates from the nongovernmental Bolivia Documentation and Information Center, an area nearly the equivalent of Rhode Island in size. That figure has risen from about 366, 000 acres a year, on average, in the 1990s and 667, 000 acres a year in the 2000s. Now, a new study by an environmental advocacy group points to fresh indications of     by Bolivian and Brazilian farmers who trade soybeans with Cargill. That organization,   Mighty Earth, used satellite imaging and   mapping information from the Stockholm Environment Institute, an environmental think tank, to identify deforestation in Brazil where two   food giants, Cargill and Bunge, are the only known agricultural traders. The   mapping by the environmental institute uses customs, shipment and storage data, as well as production data from Brazilian municipalities to trace agricultural exports back to producers. According to Mighty Earth’s analysis, the Brazilian savanna areas in which Cargill operates, a region called the Cerrado, saw more than 321, 000 acres of deforestation between 2011 and 2015. Mighty Earth also linked Bunge, the other agricultural giant, to more than 1. 4 million acres from 2011 to 2015. In Bolivia, where   mapping is not available, Mighty Earth sent employees to areas where Cargill operates. The organization used drones to record the clearing of forests and savannas in areas where Cargill operates silos. The study was funded by the Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation and a nongovernmental organization, Rainforest Foundation Norway. A reporter for The New York Times independently traveled to remote areas of Bolivia described in the environmentalists’ report and interviewed farmers engaged in deforestation who said they sold soy to Cargill. The farmers described what they called Cargill’s push to increase its purchases of locally produced soy and its attempts to enhance bonds with local producers. The reports of fresh deforestation come despite a landmark deal signed three years ago by Cargill and other companies that included a target of “eliminating deforestation from the production of agricultural commodities like palm oil, soy and beef products by 2020. ” Experts at the time said the deadline, laid out in the New York Declaration of Forests, would require companies to start straightaway to make their sourcing more sustainable. Both Cargill and Bunge said the report seemed to inflate its role in the region’s deforestation. Cargill’s share of soy in the Bolivia municipalities in which it operates came to about 8 percent, Cargill said. Meanwhile, in Brazil’s Matopiba region, Bunge’s share was about 20 percent, the company said. And soy is just one crop behind deforestation, said Stewart Lindsay, Bunge’s vice president for global corporate affairs. “One company alone cannot solve this issue,” Mr. Lindsay said. “A positive step would be for more companies to adopt zero deforestation commitments, apply controls to block crops grown in illegally cleared areas from entering their supply chains, report publicly on progress and invest millions of dollars to support sustainable land use planning efforts, all of which Bunge has done. ” (Bunge, however, is not a signatory to the New York Declaration of Forests.) In an interview, Cargill chief executive David MacLennan said the company was studying the allegations of deforestation in Bolivia and Brazil linked to the company. “If there’s something there, if it’s substantiated, we’ll do something about it,” Mr. MacLennan said. “If that’s accurate, it’s not acceptable. “We’re going to honor our obligations and our commitments,” he continued. “We’ve committed to ending deforestation and to do our part in ending deforestation. Our word is our bond. ” Forest loss is detrimental to the earth’s climate. The clearing of woodlands and the fires that accompany it generate   of all global warming emissions, according to the Union of Concerned Scientists, making the loss of forests one of the biggest single contributors to climate change. Only about 15 percent of the world’s forest cover remains intact, according to the World Resources Institute. The rest has been cleared, degraded or is in fragments, wiping out ecosystems and displacing indigenous communities, scientists say. Behind the rise in deforestation is a strategy by multinational food companies to source their agricultural commodities from ever more remote areas around the world. These areas tend to be where legal protections of forests are weakest. The Brazilian Amazon, a poster child for the global   movement, has enjoyed increasing protections, like a moratorium announced in 2006 on forest clearing for soy production. Between that time and 2015, Brazil reduced Amazon deforestation by almost   according to estimates by Mongabay, the environmental news site, based on data from the Brazilian National Institute of Space Research and the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization. The uptick in forest loss since then, however, has raised concerns that the progress is far from secure. Brazil was aware of the challenge of keeping deforestation at bay, Everton Lucero, the secretary of climate change and forests of Brazil’s Ministry of the Environment, said in an interview. “We are very uncomfortable with the bad news that we had a rise in deforestation, and we are taking every possible measure to reverse it next year,” Mr. Lucero said. Budget shortfalls amid Brazil’s recent economic and political turmoil, he said, had wreaked havoc with its policing of its rain forests. When traveling to remote regions, “Sometimes our command and control units were without fuel for helicopters,” he said. “Hopefully we are on a recovery path. ” Bolivia, on the other hand, presents a different situation. President Evo Morales, a socialist, has made securing “food sovereignty” a major part of his agenda, driving Bolivia’s agricultural expansion. There are relatively few forest protections, and the government’s Forestry and Land Authority is tasked with the potentially conflicting roles of regulating land use, forestry and agriculture, and issuing concessions for logging and farming. The landlocked country has declared that it expects to clear almost 14 million more acres of forest by 2025, to convert into farmland. Bolivia’s greenhouse gas emissions levels per capita exceed that of many European countries, despite having a far lower per capita income. Deforestation is responsible for more than 80 percent of Bolivia’s total carbon dioxide emissions, according to a recent study by researchers at Insead, a graduate school based in Fontainebleau, France. A major culprit is the cultivation of soy, which has jumped more than 500 percent in Bolivia since 1991, to 3. 8 million hectares in 2013, according to the most recent agricultural censuses. Little of that soy is consumed domestically. The vast majority is processed and exported as animal feed in a commodities trade that serves a global appetite for hamburgers, chicken and pork. “The forest is seen as useless land that needs to be made useful,” said Nataly Ascarrunz, executive director of the Bolivian Institute of Forestry Investigation, a Bolivian nongovernmental organization that monitors and researches the country’s forests. “There’s a lot of pressure for economic development,” Ms. Ascarrunz said. “When resources are flowing, production is happening and people have work. It’s very hard to argue with that. ” Victor Yucra, the director general of Bolivia’s forest and land management at the Forestry and Land Authority, stressed the need for the Bolivian government to balance the protection of its forests with the needs of its agricultural sector. “Our concern is in ensuring that intensive agricultural production takes place within a framework that also provides for sustainable forestry and protection for standing forests,” Mr. Yucra said. Mr. MacLennan, the chief executive of Cargill, described a business trip to Brazil last year, during which he saw the Amazon from a plane window. “You look down and you see this beautiful forest,” he said. “Kilometers and kilometers of forest. But you also see these big chunks of dirt. “The brown really contrasts with the green,” he continued, comparing the forest and deforested areas. “When you see it, it’s like, ‘Holy cow. That’s what’s happened.’ It just hit me when I saw it in broad daylight  —   the impact the deforestation has. ” Mr. MacLennan initially garnered praise among environmentalists for pledging to extend the   pledge it had made regarding palm oil to cover every commodity the company handles. Cargill’s commitment was called one of the most sweeping environmental pledges ever made by a large agricultural company. It earned Mr. MacLennan a photo opportunity with Ban   the United Nations secretary general at the time. Even before the New York Declaration, Cargill had made significant efforts to buy palm oil sourced only from land not linked to fresh deforestation, according to a   expert with extensive experience working on Cargill’s global sustainability efforts. The expert spoke on the condition of anonymity, saying that to do so openly would jeopardize professional relations with the company. Cargill continued to invest millions of dollars adding extra staff members and hiring   auditors to verify that the palm oil was coming from established fields, not farmland freshly carved from the forest, he said. But Cargill has been less aggressive with other commodities, he said. Part of the issue was Cargill’s decentralized setup, the expert said. Another problem was the resistance from commodities traders, whose incentive is to seek supplies from as many sources as possible in order to drive down costs. Buying only sustainably grown commodities would mean a more limited supply. Now, environmental groups accuse Cargill of backtracking on its 2020 deadline. In recent statements, Cargill has adopted a 2030 deadline for elimination of deforestation from its supply chain  —   a separate deadline, mentioned elsewhere in the New York Declaration, that was meant to apply to ending all forms of deforestation, not just those related to agricultural commodities. “They’re willfully misinterpreting the Declaration,” said Glenn Hurowitz, chief executive of Mighty Earth. “They’re breaking their own pledge. ” Cargill is committed, Mr. MacLennan said, to eliminating by 2020 deforestation from its production of palm oil, a commodity widely used in food, detergents and cosmetics. But, he said, Cargill had always understood the declaration to give all signatories until 2030 to tackle deforestation. “I don’t think I or others appreciated the vast complexity of the task,” Mr. MacLennan said. “Let’s say that we are trading or buying and selling soybean meal. Where did the soybeans come from? And did they come from deforested land? Maybe we weren’t buying the soybeans directly. I don’t know. ” Holly Gibbs, an expert in tropical deforestation and agriculture at the University of   called the 2030 deadline interpretation devastating. “If we were to wait until 2030,” Ms. Gibbs said, “there would be no forest left. ” In Mr. Janzen’s newly cleared field, a long strip of land flanked by vivid vegetation,   smoke drifted from a smoldering landscape. The   Mennonites, who live amid   buggies and farmhouses that wouldn’t look out of place in rural Ohio or Pennsylvania, trace their origins to   Protestant reformists who migrated to Russia, the United States, Canada, Belize and Mexico in search of farming opportunities and religious freedom. Some moved to Bolivia in the last century, and about 57, 000 Mennonites now live in 55 secluded settlements here, eschewing some aspects of 21st century technology, like modern cars, but enthusiastically embracing others, such as tractors and genetically modified seeds. Their trade with companies like Cargill has transformed their communities into a bloc of relatively prosperous landowners. But in recent years, they have also been targeted by land reforms enacted by Mr. Morales, who has pledged to reverse the centuries of subjugation of Bolivia’s indigenous majority. The farmer, Mr. Janzen, with the help of two laborers, spent the day digging roots from the earth, between smoking woodpiles. There was a brown jumble of slender trees, saplings, shrubs, bushes, vines and roots. Occasional larger trees showed gashes where the bulldozer first made contact, pushing them to the ground. Farther downfield lay more long, neat cordons of debris, waiting to be burned. “If the rain holds off, I’ll burn the rest tomorrow,” he said.	1
772	 Did Godsmack really change their name? Godsmack has performed under their name since forming in 1995. The band has released a staggering fifteen top 5 singles during their career. Over time, as society has become sensitive to terms they deem offensive, bands, brands, and professional sports teams have been restricted from using their original monikers.Today, Godsmack has officially announced they will be changing their name after a group of listeners claimed the name was offensive. Oddly, the fans weren’t offended because the band is called “GODSMACK”, they’re offended because the name doesn’t seem to have much to do with the band.Instead, the group suggested that the band change their name to “POWERCHORD”. The band agreed and has subsequently changed their name to the agreed term. The Daily Bro’ is an online publication designed to provide the average bro with a simplistic news reading experience.

187	When “The Good Wife” had its premiere, there was a clear line from Hillary Clinton to Alicia Florrick (Julianna Margulies) the ambitious lawyer who came into her own after her politician husband’s sex scandal. But the show had another Clinton figure all along: Diane Lockhart (Christine Baranski) who hired, befriended and ultimately fell out with Alicia. A leonine liberal not allergic to money or a highball of fine Scotch, she rose in a boy’s club through alliances, compromise and knowing how much of herself to conceal. Diane begins “The Good Fight” ready for a change. Like certain other people of her political persuasion recently, she meets a less happy kind of change than she was expecting. But for her  —   and for this improbable but promising spinoff  —   it ends up being an invigorating new start. The series opens a year after the end of “The Good Wife,” in which Diane hauled off and smacked Alicia for revealing, in order to win a court case, that Diane’s husband, Kurt McVeigh (Gary Cole) had had an affair. Now, Diane is leaving her Chicago law firm and shopping  —   alone  —   for a retirement vineyard in Provence. That sounds like the premise of a typical TV spinoff (Frasier moving to Seattle, Rhoda to New York). But “The Good Fight” does not find Diane struggling to grow a decent carignan or getting to know her quirky Provençal neighbors. Her nest egg was invested with two of her oldest friends, Henry and Lenore Rindell (Paul Guilfoyle and Bernadette Peters) who plowed it into a Ponzi scheme. Effectively broke and jobless, she’s forced to start over. She ends up across town, at a mainly   firm run by Adrian Boseman (Delroy Lindo) reunited with Lucca Quinn (Cush Jumbo) Alicia’s old comrade. Other familiar faces include Marissa Gold (Sarah Steele) who returns as Diane’s assistant the viperous law partner David Lee (Zach Grenier) and Charles Abernathy (Denis O’Hare) one of the quirky judges on the original show’s packed bench. By the end of its run, “The Good Wife” grew so sprawling that it played like several shows sharing the same hour. “The Good Fight,” also run by Robert and Michelle King, doesn’t reinvent the franchise so much as pare off a manageable chunk. It’s still distinctive, though, for a new drama to star an actress in her 60s. The upgrade plays to Ms. Baranski’s range, as she conveys both Diane’s desperation and the will it takes to master and move past it. “The Good Fight” pairs her comeback story with that of the newly minted lawyer Maia Rindell (Rose Leslie, “Game of Thrones”) who is dogged by her parents’ scandal much as Alicia was by her husband’s. She’s the good daughter, guarded, shellshocked and a bit of an enigma. Lucca, meanwhile, often plays the sounding board for Diane, as if she and Maia were going halfsies on Alicia’s role. Alicia herself is a sort of absent presence here. When Diane tells Maia why she’s willing to take seemingly unsavory clients, she seems to allude to their falling out: “People I thought with all my heart were guilty turned out to be innocent,” she says. “People I thought were saints  —   they weren’t. ” Basically, Diane is doing the same job in a different location, and so is “The Good Fight,” which will stream online on the CBS All Access subscription service. The first two episodes go online Sunday night, with additional episodes every Sunday. The pilot will show on regular CBS Sunday (edited for time and broadcast standards) after which CBS will have to pray that its traditional TV audience can find the internet. I can sum up how the move from network to streaming changes the show in one word. Unfortunately, it’s a word I can’t repeat here. Diane utters it about 20 minutes into the pilot it appears copiously thereafter. It’s not as jarring as you might think. “The Good Wife” had an unusual maturity and moral ambiguity for a broadcast drama now “The Good Fight” has the expletives to match. (The episodes also run slightly longer.) The Kings often argued that “The Good Wife” deserved credit for churning out 22 episodes a year for CBS, implying that the show might have been different if given the shorter season of a cable or streaming series. But “The Good Fight,” despite having 10 episodes, so far plays much the same  —   the snappy dialogue, the technology obsession, the     structure. It contrasts with, say, AMC’s “Better Call Saul,” which established a different voice for a different protagonist. Consistency is no crime, but it will be interesting to see if the show evolves. The   firm setting, for instance, might shake up the often very white legal world of “The Good Wife. ” Also, with Alicia gone, “The Good Fight” has a less direct connection to politics, with one early exception  —   the universal exception, Donald J. Trump. The first episode, “Inauguration,” opens with a scene (added well into shooting) of Diane watching Mr. Trump’s swearing in, stunned. The surprise election result turns the series’ premise into an unintended metaphor. Diane stands in for a certain breed of liberal who expected to be able to take a breather, the glass ceiling shattered, the gains consolidated. Instead, her financial ruin  —   the scam, we learn, wiped out “many of the nation’s liberal elites”  —   leaves her to claw her way back. Oddly, this makes the series feel more    than if it had aired as planned, during a triumphalist Clinton administration. Diane Lockhart would never admit this, but Mr. Trump may have done her a favor.	1
496	Southeastern Australia has suffered through a series of brutal heat waves over the past two months, with temperatures reaching a scorching 113 degrees Fahrenheit in some parts of the state of New South Wales. “It was nothing short of awful,” said Sarah   of the Climate Change Research Center at the University of New South Wales, in Sydney. “In Australia, we’re used to a little bit of heat. But this was at another level. ” So Dr.   who studies climate extremes, did what comes naturally: She looked to see whether there was a link between the heat and   climate change. Her analysis, conducted with a   group of researchers called World Weather Attribution, was made public on Thursday. Their conclusion was that climate change made maximum temperatures like those seen in January and February at least 10 times more likely than a century ago, before significant greenhouse gas emissions from human activity started warming the planet. Looked at another way, that means that the kind of soaring temperatures expected to occur in New South Wales once every 500 years on average now may occur once every 50 years. What is more, the researchers found that if climate change continued unabated, such maximum temperatures may occur on average every five years. For the overall   summer in New South Wales, the researchers say, climate change made the hot average temperatures  —   which set records for the state  —   at least 50 times more likely than in the past. The findings are the latest in what has become a growing field: studies that try to assess the influence of climate change on extreme weather as soon as possible. The idea is to offer scientific analyses of heat waves, floods and other events while people are still talking about them, and to counter the spread of misinformation, intentional or not, about the impact of global warming. Climate scientists have long said that climate change should bring an increase in extreme events like dry spells and heat waves. Because warmth causes more evaporation and warmer air holds more moisture, climate change should also lead to more intense and frequent storms. Studies have shown that these effects are occurring on a broad scale. But the natural variability of weather makes looking at individual events more difficult. World Weather Attribution, which is coordinated by Climate Central, a research organization in Princeton, N. J. is one of a number of groups doing rapid analysis. Among other events, they have looked at flooding in Germany and France last May high temperatures in the Arctic in November and December and an usually strong storm that hit northern Britain in 2015. Not all attribution studies have found a   link. In general, studies of heat waves tend to produce the clearest signal of the influence, or not, of global warming. Australian heat waves have been examined in the past, most recently in several studies that showed a clear link between climate change and a period of torrid weather in 2013. David Karoly, a scientist at the University of Melbourne, was involved in one of the studies, which took more than six months to produce. “That was considered very rapid at the time,” Dr. Karoly said. As a member of World Weather Attribution, Dr. Karoly helped with the study of the recent heat waves, which took about two weeks. A big difference between the two studies is in the use of computer climate models  —   both of the current atmosphere with its greenhouse gas emissions and of a hypothetical atmosphere as if those emissions had never occurred and climate change was not happening. For the older study, as for most attribution studies in the recent past, the models were run over and over again, which took months. The newer, rapid studies use models that have already been run, extracting data as needed.	1
214	MIAMI  —   Who does Donald J. Trump call when he needs a wall built on the United   border? An old friend, it turns out: the   king of Miami, Jorge Pérez  —   often described as the Donald Trump of the tropics. Mr. Pérez is accustomed to such phone calls  —   and to people returning his. When Forbes magazine estimates your net worth at nearly $3 billion, V. I. P. treatment  —   even from the White House  —   tends to follow. That attention is also bipartisan. Mr. Pérez, 67, a major figure in the Miami art world and a developer who has helped remake the city’s skyline, publicly supported Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign. But he said Mr. Trump lost little time in phoning him after his victory in November. In fact, the emails and calls between the two men  —   who have known each other as business partners for several decades  —   actually increased. “You have to give him credit for reaching out,” Mr. Pérez said of these conversations in an interview in the living room of his waterfront Miami mansion. Though Mr. Pérez passed on Mr. Trump’s January request for help constructing the wall  —   pointedly quipping, “Once it’s finished, which side of it will I be on?”  —   he said Mr. Trump still seemed eager to enlist him in joining the administration. Despite differences regarding both foreign affairs and federal housing policy (Mr. Pérez said, “I’m a strong believer in increased housing subsidies. ”) the president offered him the job of deputy secretary of Housing and Urban Development, Secretary Ben Carson’s No. 2, Mr. Pérez said. Again, he declined. In late January, he said, President Trump was back on the phone, discussing the job of assistant secretary of state for Western Hemisphere affairs, the position responsible for promoting United States interests throughout Latin America. Mr. Pérez, the son of Cuban exiles who was raised in Colombia, said no once again. Hope Hicks, a White House spokeswoman, asked about these offers and the current state of the relationship between President Trump and Mr. Pérez, declined to comment. Mr. Pérez, in describing his rejection of the job offers, explained, “I’m not a yes man. ” He added, “I told him he needs to hear the voices of people that are not dependent on him, that are going to give him the truth. ” To that point, he then told Bloomberg News in a Jan. 31 article he thought the idea of a Mexican border wall was “idiotic. ” That was more than two weeks ago. Despite sending   letters to Mr. Trump’s personal email account, and getting confirmation from Mr. Trump’s personal secretary that they had been read, Mr. Pérez hasn’t heard a word back. It’s a rupture that speaks to the uncomfortable social terrain Mr. Pérez now occupies. He is trying to balance a longstanding personal relationship with Mr. Trump as well as his own increasingly prominent role as an arts philanthropist  —   from producing documentary films and financing exchange programs for Cuban artists to donating over $55 million in cash and art to the financially beleaguered Miami Art Museum, which rechristened itself the Pérez Art Museum Miami in his honor. Yet these two milieus  —   the White House and the cultural arena  —   now eye each other with both open hostility and wariness toward anyone unwilling to pick a side. Mr. Pérez may see himself as a trusted back channel between apprehensive cultural figures and President Trump: “I would help him try to see the different opinions of the art world,” he said. Much of the art world, however, hardly seems in the mood for such a genteel   . “Jorge Pérez is wasting his time,” insisted Amanda Keeley, the owner of Miami’s Exile Books, when asked about Mr. Pérez’s efforts to reach out to the president. Ms. Keeley led fellow Miami artists to demonstrate at the Womens March on Washington last month. “Donald Trump isn’t interested in listening,” she said, “and you can’t have a conversation with someone who doesn’t want to listen to you. ” Indeed, as Inauguration Day loomed, many staff members at the museum carrying Mr. Pérez’s name said they believed the time had already passed for measured discussion. There was talk of heeding the call from the New   organizers of the J20 Art Strike, which sought to close museums nationwide as a symbolic action opposing not only Mr. Trump but also “Trumpists who use the social prestige of art to legitimize power. ” It was hard not to see the museum’s largest benefactor falling within those cross hairs. In response, its director, Franklin Sirmans, sent a memo to the staff, insisting “we will be open to all in our community as a place of dialogue and conversation” on Inauguration Day. A month later, Mr. Pérez is the one looking for help in sparking a dialogue. “He’s a good friend,” Mr. Pérez said of Mr. Trump. “Or at least he was, until I made a statement about the wall. ” The last time they spoke? “Him saying ‘please come to Palm Beach and    we’re spending weekends there. ’” And now? “It’s gone to radio silence, to zero,” he said. Mr. Pérez said he believed that as president, “instead of moderating, Donald was retrenching. The rhetoric of the campaign was brutal,” but he never assumed it was a preview of the candidate’s actual policies. Mr. Pérez was distressed by reports that Mr. Trump intended to eliminate the National Endowment for the Arts, on whose board Mr. Pérez had served under President Clinton. He was even more upset at chatter that Mr. Trump might take a tougher stand on the trade opening with Cuba, where Mr. Pérez accompanied President Obama last March as part of a historic state visit. Mr. Pérez said he couldn’t fathom this turnaround in Mr. Trump: “We used to talk about Cuba as a place to do business  —   a Trump hotel, a Trump golf course. ” So during that last phone call, he asked Mr. Trump   did he intend to tighten the trade embargo against Cuba? “He gave me no real answer  —   not yes, not no. Just ‘We’re going to see what happens, I haven’t decided on that yet. ’” Next came Mr. Trump’s executive order announcing a travel ban, prompting an exasperated Mr. Pérez to give his fateful Bloomberg interview. Meanwhile, Mr. Pérez is focusing on art. Later this month, he returns to Havana with Mr. Sirmans, visiting artists’ studios as a prelude to the June exhibition of “On the Horizon: Contemporary Cuban Art From the Jorge M. Pérez Collection,” drawn from more than 160 artworks that he recently donated. “Cubans came here and built up great businesses, bringing in Latin Americans who have a love for the city. ” He concluded, “contemporary Latin American art and culture is what should go with that movement. ” The composition of “On The Horizon” is evidence of further social changes. The work of younger Cuban artists who came of age in Miami, such as Antonia Wright, will be installed alongside that of artists who left the island at various points in their adult careers, such as Rubén Torres Llorca, as well as those still based there, like Kcho. In years past, that lack of distinction would have been politically fraught. Mr. Pérez bristled at the notion that   with Mr. Trump was futile. “Playing into the game is O. K. if you produce results,” he said of such outreach, citing his concerns over a report that the Trump administration was considering eliminating the arts endowment. “If I could sit down with him and get it to function at half its budget until the next Democratic president gets in, is that worse than having it totally cut?” Mr. Pérez stopped short and chuckled to himself. “First I need to be able to talk to him. ” He’s still waiting for the phone to ring.	1
322	MEXICO CITY  —   In the White House, President Trump was telling American chief executives on Thursday that the days of being treated unfairly by Mexico  —   on trade, on immigration, on crime  —   were over. “You see what’s happening at the border: All of a sudden, for the first time, we’re getting gang members out,” Mr. Trump said, referring to his instructions to increase deportations of undocumented immigrants. “And it’s a military operation. ” But in Mexico, his homeland security secretary, John F. Kelly, was saying the opposite, trying to tamp down fears of a military operation and to assure the public that American soldiers would not be used to police the border. “I repeat: There will be no use of military in this,” Mr. Kelly said at a news conference on Thursday, appearing with Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson. “At least half of you try to get that right, because it continues to come up in your reporting. ” Mr. Trump has a penchant for dropping unwelcome surprises during visits between the United States and Mexico. Last month, on the first day of a trip to Washington by Mexico’s foreign minister, Mr. Trump signed an executive order to build a wall between the two countries. Then, this week, just before Mr. Kelly and Mr. Tillerson touched down in Mexico, his administration released policies that vastly expanded the potential for deportation of undocumented immigrants. Mr. Trump is certainly not the only American president to clamp down on illegal immigration. His predecessor, Barack Obama, deported record numbers of immigrants, including gang members. But Mr. Trump’s actions and disparaging remarks about Mexico have helped push relations between the two countries to their lowest point in decades. His steady stream of provocative policies and statements has enraged the Mexican public and left their leaders to consider their own leverage in the event of a meltdown in ties between the two countries, whether on trade, migration or security. On Thursday, the contradictions between the president and his top staff raised a pressing question: Which version of Washington will come to bear on Mexico in the coming months? Will it be the aggressive approach of the president or the more reassuring stance of Mr. Kelly, who will be assigned to oversee some of the proposals likely to antagonize Mexico the most? “Let me be very, very clear,” Mr. Kelly said, assuring Mexicans that the rules for deporting people from the United States had not fundamentally changed  —   another possible contradiction of his boss. “There will be no, repeat no, mass deportations. ” The statements during the visit offered a startling departure from past trips to Mexico by American diplomats. Four officials  —   two from Mexico and two from the United States  —   walked into a large ballroom with grim faces and made carefully worded comments without taking any questions. It was the kind of cautious staging normally seen after tough negotiations between adversaries, not talks between friendly neighbors. No one suggested that a breakthrough had been made. “Two strong sovereign countries from time to time will have differences,” Mr. Tillerson said. Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray of Mexico called it a “complex moment in the relationship. ” In the last month, Mexican officials have shown cautious restraint, and even silence, in response to Mr. Trump’s threats, often to the frustration of the Mexican people. Their logic, officials say, is cleareyed: To descend into a fight with the United States would serve no one, least of all the Mexican people who are spoiling for a harder line against Mr. Trump. But that is not to say the Mexicans are without recourse. While they are hoping to avoid a confrontation, the whispers of discontent have started to spread. The minister of economy has said there will be no trade talks without similar talks on security and migration, twin areas of vulnerability for the United States. And Mr. Videgaray, responding to a directive from Mr. Trump broadening the scope of deportations in America, has vowed to bring to the United Nations any actions by the United States to send   to Mexico. Mexico is keenly aware of its leverage in the bilateral relationship: billions of dollars in agricultural purchases by Mexico, a decade of security cooperation to dismantle cartels and intercept drugs destined for the United States, and the detention of hundreds of thousands of migrants passing through Mexico on their way to America’s southern border. On trade, putting aside the supply chains of vehicles and electronics engineered by the North American Free Trade Agreement, agriculture is a major vulnerability for the United States. Mexico is an immense purchaser of American farm goods. The nation is the No. 1 purchaser of American corn, dairy, pork and rice. Mexico purchased nearly $2 billion of corn in 2016 and also bought large amounts of soybeans, wheat, cotton and beef. A Mexican lawmaker recently proposed a bill to redirect purchases of corn away from the United States, a tactic that could devastate American corn farmers in the heartland of Mr. Trump’s base. Both Brazil and Argentina offer alternatives to the American Corn Belt, experts and officials say. “There are a lot of jobs in agriculture that are dependent on Nafta in America,” said Gregorio Schneider, the founder of TC Latin America Partners, a New   private equity firm that invests in Mexico. “You are talking about the center of the United States. ” On national security, Mexico also plays a large role. The government could slow down extraditions to the United States, keeping   drug lords like Joaquín Guzmán Loera, known as El Chapo, instead of sending them north. It could also stop deporting American fugitives who have fled to Mexico. Perhaps more threatening to the United States would be a reconsideration of Mexico’s participation in the drug war. For more than a decade, the Mexican authorities have cooperated in arresting top cartel leaders and intercepting drug shipments destined for the United States. Mexico could also leverage its participation in the sharing of intelligence. The vast majority of drugs funneled  —   and tunneled  —   through Mexico are not for domestic consumption. “We receive information from Mexican authorities on a daily basis that helps us better target drugs smugglers at the border,” said Gil Kerlikowske, who was the commissioner of Customs and Border Protection in the Obama administration. “These are ties we want to strengthen, not weaken. ” Mr. Kerlikowske said Mexican federal police officers were stationed in Tucson and in Laredo, Tex. where they assist American law enforcement in identifying drug cartels and human smugglers by sharing information in Mexican criminal history databases. Likewise, American Customs and Border Protection officers are assigned to a joint program in Mexico City, where they share information on possible drug traffickers through the use of American law enforcement databases. In 2015, joint operations between the Border Patrol and Mexican law enforcement led to the discovery of 30 drug tunnels and about 80, 000 pounds of drugs. Whether policing the southern American border to prevent unwanted migrants from entering the United States or examining passenger manifests to ensure   suspects cannot enter through Mexico, the authorities here have been a critical component of America’s national security strategy. In 2014, Mexico launched Plan Frontera Sur to safeguard its southern border from migrants trying to enter from Central America. The plan has essentially served as a dragnet 1, 000 miles south of the Texas border, catching hundreds of thousands of Salvadorans, Hondurans and Guatemalans en route to the United States. Some experts and officials have suggested that Mexico could simply ease up on its border patrols, granting passage to large numbers of Central Americans. That would not only swamp the American authorities, but might enable potentially dangerous migrants to slip into the country. Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, tried later in the day to clarify the contradiction between Mr. Trump’s and Mr. Kelly’s remarks. He said that Mr. Trump had not meant to characterize the deportation efforts as a military operation, arguing that the president had been using the word “military” as an adjective. “It’s being done with precision,” Mr. Spicer said. The meetings here on Thursday produced a modicum of agreement between the United States and Mexico. Both Mr. Tillerson and Mr. Kelly acknowledged the significance of border cooperation to address the flow of migration from Central America to the United States. It is a topic that Mr. Kelly, who led more than 1, 000 military personnel of the United States Southern Command, knows something about. He has in the past outlined a more balanced approach to protecting the borders, saying security cannot “be attempted as an endless series of ‘  stands’ on the   line at the official ports of entry or along the thousands of miles of border between this country and Mexico. ” This could place him once more at odds with the mandates of his boss, Mr. Trump, whose executive order to build a wall will fall directly among Mr. Kelly’s responsibilities.	1
252	KENNEDY SPACE CENTER, Fla.  —   Engines ignited and a rocket lifted off here on Sunday, for the first time since the last space shuttle launch five and a half years ago. A Falcon 9 rocket from Elon Musk’s Space Exploration Technologies Corporation  —   SpaceX  —   was launched, quickly disappearing into a low cloud deck, with 5, 500 pounds of supplies, experiments and other cargo headed to the International Space Station. The Dragon cargo capsule is to arrive at the station on Wednesday. A robotic arm will grab the capsule and take it to one of the docking ports. “All is looking great,” Jessica Jensen, the director of Dragon mission management at SpaceX, said in a news conference after the launch. “We’re not expecting any issues. ” SpaceX was again able to recover the booster stage. As the second stage ignited to push the cargo capsule to orbit, the booster turned around back toward land. Eight minutes after it left the ground, it set down on a landing site a few miles away. It was the eighth successful landing and the third on land. (The other landings occurred on floating platforms in the ocean.) The success was another step in the recovery of SpaceX from a major setback last September when one of its rockets caught fire and exploded on a launchpad at the adjoining Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. A launch attempt on Saturday was called off with 13 seconds left because of what Mr. Musk described as “slightly odd” readings with a backup motor for steering the engine nozzle on the second stage. In response to a question posted on Twitter by a MSNBC producer, Mr. Musk said that he called off the launch to take a closer look to make sure the readings were not a sign of a more significant, undetected problem. In another post, Mr. Musk wrote, “1% chance isn’t worth rolling the dice. Better to wait a day. ” Overnight, SpaceX technicians swapped out the mechanism. The odd readings did not recur during Sunday’s countdown. . SpaceX hopes to catch up on its jammed schedule, which was delayed after the explosion. It plans to launch a used rocket  —   one of the recovered boosters  —   this spring. The next cargo mission for NASA is to be the first to reuse a capsule from a previous flight. The launch of the Falcon Heavy, a larger rocket years behind schedule, is aimed for summer. And by the end of the year, the company wants to test a rocket and capsule that is to lead to ferrying astronauts to the space station. Beyond the resumption of SpaceX’s space station deliveries, Sunday’s launch also marked a transition of the Kennedy Space Center toward private use of the facilities. In 2014, SpaceX took over a former space shuttle launchpad that NASA no longer needed. “This pad would have just sat here and rusted away in the salt air had we not had the use agreement with SpaceX,” Robert D. Cabana, the space center director, said at a news conference in front of the launchpad on Friday. “What an awesome use of a great American asset. ” Launchpad 39A was where the space shuttle Atlantis lifted off on July 8, 2011, on the last shuttle mission, and was home to the first shuttle launch in 1981. It was also the starting point for all but one of the manned Apollo missions, including Apollo 11, the first moon landing, in 1969. The cancellation by the Obama administration of Constellation, a program intended to send astronauts back to the moon, led many to wonder whether the Kennedy Space Center had much of a future. The revised vision for NASA, unveiled in early 2010, called for a   hiatus in rocket development to allow investment in innovative but unready technologies  —   and nothing on the horizon to launch from Kennedy. (Launching continued at Cape Canaveral.) Mr. Cabana recast Kennedy from a center dedicated to launching NASA rockets to what he described a “multiuser spaceport. ” Congress pushed the Obama administration to revive aspects of Constellation. Two months after the last space shuttle mission, NASA announced the Space Launch System, a   rocket that would take astronauts on deep space missions and eventually to Mars. While the cancellation of Constellation battered Kennedy, another shift in NASA direction  —   turning over the launching of space station astronauts to private companies  —   opened possibilities. SpaceX and Boeing won the NASA contracts. Boeing is now building its   Starliner in a Kennedy building once used for refurbishing space shuttles. SpaceX and Boeing are scheduled to launch the first astronaut missions in 2018, although a report released Thursday by the federal Government Accountability Office concluded that remaining technical obstacles would cause the launches, already a year late, to slip into early 2019. For SpaceX, issues included cracks in the turbine blades of the engines. At the Friday news conference, Gwynne Shotwell, the president of SpaceX, said the response of company officials was, “The hell we won’t fly before 2019!” Ms. Shotwell said the cracks were long known and represented an acceptable risk for current satellite and cargo missions. She said the company had incorporated a fix in the next upgrade of the Falcon 9 rocket, which is to fly later this year. On Twitter, Mr. Musk said, “I feel very confident of 2018. ” Sierra Nevada, one of the companies that lost the astronaut competition but which has since been selected for carrying cargo to the space station, has also opened up shop at Kennedy Space Center as has Blue Origin, the rocket company founded by Jeff Bezos, founder of Amazon, and Moon Express, a   company seeking to send robotic landers to the moon. However, NASA still had no use for launchpad 39A or many of the other buildings that had been used for the space shuttle program. The other former shuttle pad, 39B, is sufficient to handle up to three Space Launch System launches a year, Mr. Cabana said. Currently, NASA envisions a pace of one launch every one or two years. With its lease, SpaceX dismantled some of the shuttle infrastructure, built a large hangar for storing its rockets and refurbished the pad to handle the Falcon 9, the Falcon Heavy and NASA astronaut launches. “We want to see more launches, government and commercial, off all these pads,” Mr. Cabana said. The rocket launched Sunday carried Sage III, an instrument to be installed on the space station to measure levels of ozone, aerosols and dust in the Earth’s atmosphere for at least three years. It is latest in a series of instruments that have made similar measurements since the late 1970s. Another instrument will track lightning. The cargo capsule is also carrying a demonstration project to test autopilot navigation technologies for eventual use by robotic spacecraft to repair satellites. With the successful launch from Kennedy, SpaceX will now work to bring the launchpad damaged in September back into operation this summer. As SpaceX wraps up development of its Falcon rockets, Ms. Shotwell said, in about a year, the company will shift its attention to Mr. Musk’s dream of a spacecraft for taking people to Mars. Plans for sending a Dragon capsule with instruments but no people to land on Mars have slipped to 2020 from 2018, Ms. Shotwell said.	1
335	SEOUL, South Korea  —   Some female college students received emails a few years ago that sounded like a phishing scam, offering a     opportunity for free travel and a spot on South Korea’s Olympic women’s hockey team. The offers were sincere. Officials in South Korea had apparently scoured online rosters for North American college hockey programs, looking for women with last names that looked as if they might be Korean. They were on a shopping spree to assemble Olympic hockey teams from scratch for the 2018 Winter Games. As the host of the next Olympics, next February in Pyeongchang, South Korea has automatic berths in the men’s and women’s ice hockey competitions, which are premier events at any Winter Games. But hockey here is an afterthought, so the country had to get creative if it wanted to field teams that would not be humiliated. “I never dreamed this would happen,” said Danelle Im, who was born in Toronto to Korean parents and was attending Wilfrid Laurier University in Ontario in 2012 when she received the curious email. She is now a forward on South Korea’s national team. Countries commonly take advantage of loose citizenship rules to import   talent in all sports. South Korea’s hockey project is among the more aggressive and novel examples. For the men’s team, they recruited several North Americans playing on one of the three South   teams in the Asia League. They offered naturalization to a handful of players from the United States and Canada  —   none of whom have any Korean ancestry. Mike Testwuide, a Colorado native, was approached by the national team coach, Jim Paek, a   Stanley Cup champion with the Pittsburgh Penguins, during his second season with Anyang Halla of the Asia League. On a men’s squad that includes players with a wide range of abilities, Testwuide, a strapping    center out of Colorado College, offers the big, physical presence in short supply here. The prospect of joining the Olympic fraternity thrilled the    Testwuide. But it took him a week to agree to become the first men’s hockey player to become a dual citizen of the United States and the Republic of Korea. That was how long he needed to gauge his comfort level with two prospects: Could he hold his right hand over his heart during the playing of a national anthem that was not “The   Banner” and not feel like an impostor  —   or a traitor? And how would one of the world’s most homogeneous cultures react to a towering,   forward representing them on the world stage? “There’s a lot of negativity out there,” Testwuide said. “In the U. S. it was like, ‘Why would you want to play for another country? ’” He added, “And in Korea it’s like, ‘Why are we bringing you guys in? ’” The naturalization process took roughly a month, Testwuide said, and included memorizing the Korean national anthem. It took considerably longer for him to feel comfortable in his dual role as hockey ringer and proselytizer of puck. “You want to be as Korean as possible, but in your head you’re kind of fighting it and you’re questioning whether you’re doing the right thing,” Testwuide said, adding, “It’s a big responsibility, and it’s a ton of added pressure. ” Tyler Brickler, a Chicago native whose mother is from South Korea, is in the process of acquiring his citizenship. Brickler, 26, was invited to a national training camp in South Korea during his senior year at SUNY Geneseo and signed out of college with the Asia League, his interest whetted by the possibility of an Olympic berth. “It is a very weird situation for me, for sure,” Brickler said before a home game in February in the northern Seoul suburb of Goyang. “Playing in North America, I was sometimes considered the Asian player on the team, but when I came out here I’m considered the American. ” He added, “I might not look it fully or speak it, but no one can take away the fact that I have Korean blood from my mother. ” Marissa Brandt, who played at Gustavus Adolphus College in St. Peter, Minn. will be a defenseman on the women’s team, whose roster is about 20 percent North American. She was born in South Korea and adopted by an American family. “When I was in the States, I didn’t want to be Korean, I wanted to be like everyone else,” she said. In the summer of 2015, she traveled to Korea for the first time since her adoption to attend a hockey camp and was transformed. “It was definitely an ” said Brandt, who now wears her Korean name, Yoon Jung Park, on her jersey. “Coming back, I am Korean. ” When Pyeongchang won the bid to host the 2018 Winter Games in 2011, South Korea had 1, 880 registered ice hockey players, according to statistics kept by the International Ice Hockey Federation. The United States in the same period had more than 500, 000. The defenseman Donku Lee, a   member who plays with Testwuide on Anyang Halla, was blunt in his assessment of the challenge facing the South Koreans in Pyeongchang. “The other teams will be fighting with tanks and the Koreans will be using wooden sticks,” Lee said. There has been marked progress. The women’s team recently beat Thailand,   in the Asian Winter Games and lost,   to Japan  —   a respectable result after losing its previous six meetings to Japan by a combined score of   according to local news reports. And at the Division I Group A World Championships last year, the men scored their first victory against Japan, a   shutout. The sport still operates largely in a vacuum in a country that is crazy for speed skating and figure skating. At a coffee house two blocks from Anyang Halla’s rink, a longtime resident, huddled at a table with two friends, looked up from his hot drink with a confused expression when asked about the local hockey team. What hockey team? he asked. “There’s a lot of people in Korea who aren’t as educated about the game they don’t really know what we’re up against,” said Testwuide, who signed an   contract with the Philadelphia Flyers and played for the Adirondack Phantoms and Abbotsford Heat of the American Hockey League before moving to Korea. “They think, ‘We brought you guys in here so we can compete with Canada,’ and that’s where it’s hard. I could barely make an N. H. L. lineup. The reality of it is one of Team Canada’s player salaries is probably the entire budget we have for players’ salaries and everything for the Olympic run. ” The Korea Ice Hockey Association has a   $20 million plan to accelerate the development of its men’s and women’s national teams. The imports, as the North American men are commonly called, feel an urgency to make the national team more competitive on the world stage. It is a challenge complicated by cultural mores as foreign as the Korean alphabet to the North Americans, who recognize that Koreans do not like to lose, especially by lopsided scores that could cause chemyeon, or loss of face. That’s a particular concern to the men’s team, which opens preliminary play against   defending champion Canada. “It’s such a young hockey country,” said Matt Dalton, the   goaltender who plays for Anyang Halla. “Anything they can put their hat on, they try to use it to further momentum. Like when we beat Japan once and people were like, ‘We’re better now.’ When I hear something like that, my first instinct is, ‘Guys, let’s not get too high here. ’” The Goyang Ice Rink, where Brickler’s High 1 team plays some of its home games, had fewer than 300 fans in the   arena before a recent game, held during the first major snowstorm of the winter. The crowd  —   and the noise  —   was bolstered by a group of 100 High 1   fans, mostly team employees who performed continuous card stunts. They tirelessly raised squares of colored paper to form messages like “We Will Win” while a man pounded on a drum. Across the ice, two women sat huddled against the cold, wearing    Canada mittens and tracking the movements of the   2018 Korean Olympic team member Mike Swift, who was centering High 1’s top line. The women were Swift’s mother and aunt, visiting from rural Ontario, Canada, where Swift was reared. Swift’s mother, Darlene, was asked when her son last played a competitive game in front of so few people. “I don’t think he ever has,” she said. Swift, 29, is a    center with a sting, quick to throw a check. His physical style of play has no translation in Korea, where hard hits remain a largely foreign concept. Even if the body is willing, Korean players said, the mind is inclined to think twice because of an   team hierarchy that frowns on a younger player checking an elder. The North Americans have heard stories of a Korean forced to pay a postgame visit to the opponents’ dressing room to apologize for a crushing hit delivered to an older player. The hits are less likely to come from hips than sticks, which are sometimes wielded like swords. Swift said his body had not taken a beating in the Asia League, but his face had. He smiled to reveal a few missing front teeth. Sarah Murray, the   women’s coach who won two national titles playing at the University of   said communication posed her biggest challenge. “Sometimes players look scared when I talk to them,” said Murray, whose father, Andy, coached in the N. H. L. “There’s so much I want to say to them, and I do want to have a very personal relationship with my players. Sometimes it’s hard to say with someone else saying it for you. ” Murray confronted one cultural barrier that was easier to surmount. When she first arrived in Korea, she was taken aback to see that her players did not know how to hop over the boards from the bench onto the ice. “They always used the door,” she said. “They were literally running into each other coming off and going on. ” For the men and the women, progress has come slowly, yet expectations will be lofty. “I love being an underdog,” Murray said. “That’s what I want at the Olympics. Nobody knows what to expect. I would love to shock people. ”	1
571	 For months now, rumors have circulated the Internet that individuals were being paid to protest at rallies held by presidential hopeful Donald Trump. Today a man from Trump’s rally in Fountain Hills, Arizona back in March has come forward to say that he was paid to protest the event.“I was given $3,500 to protest Donald Trump’s rally in Fountain Hills,” said the 37-year-old man, who asked not to be identified due to his reputation for telling lies for profit. “I answered a Craigslist ad about a group needing actors for a political event. I interviewed with them and got the part.” If you are reading this, you’ve been duped yet again by one of my unimaginative, unfunny fake “news” stories. More money for me, you stupid idiot. Ha, ha!	0

61	WASHINGTON  —   After North Korea threatened on New Year’s Day to test an intercontinental ballistic missile, Donald J. Trump, then   reacted with characteristic swagger. He vowed to stop the North from developing a nuclear weapon capable of hitting the United States. “It won’t happen!” he wrote on Twitter. But six weeks later, after North Korea defiantly launched a missile into the sea, Mr. Trump, now president, reacted with surprising restraint. Appearing before cameras late at night on Saturday in Florida with his golfing guest, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan, Mr. Trump read a statement of just 23 words that pledged American support for Tokyo without even mentioning North Korea. The muted comment stood in sharp contrast to his response after Iran tested a ballistic missile, when he directed his national security adviser to publicly warn Tehran that he was “officially putting Iran on notice” and followed up with sanctions. If North Korea was testing the new president, as many analysts believe, then Mr. Trump seemed intent on showing that he would not be baited into a confrontation every time an American adversary tried to provoke him. At least not right away. In his short time in office, Mr. Trump has shown that he can respond to events in measured ways one moment and with hotheaded bluster the next. But even after waking up on Sunday morning, Mr. Trump chose to publicly feud with Mark Cuban, the owner of the Dallas Mavericks, rather than the maverick leader of North Korea. “I assume they don’t have a strategy yet, so Trump with Abe by his side was properly taciturn, surprisingly so,” said Jeffrey A. Bader, an Asia scholar at the Brookings Institution who served as President Barack Obama’s Asia adviser. “But that can’t hold. At some point you need to articulate a strategy. ” The tempered response may also have reflected the fact that the missile launched on Sunday by North Korea was either a   or an   missile, according to the American military, and not an intercontinental missile, or ICBM, capable of reaching the United States. The missile flew 310 miles before dropping harmlessly into the Sea of Japan, according to the South Korean military, which identified it as an   Musudan. North Korea regularly tests missiles in violation of United Nations resolutions, including roughly two dozen last year, but has boasted that it could test an ICBM “anytime and anywhere. ” The kind tested on Sunday poses a potential threat to American allies in Japan and South Korea and American forces in the Pacific, but could not strike the United States. “It’s yet unclear what missile was tested,” said Thomas Karako, a missile expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. “What is certain is that North Korea has now begun 2017 by continuing the aggressive pace of missile testing they’ve shown in recent years. ” North Korea challenged Mr. Obama early in his tenure, too, with an underground nuclear blast four months after he took office. The effect was to harden Mr. Obama’s attitude toward North Korea for the rest of his presidency, according to former aides. Rather than try to negotiate, as both Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush did, Mr. Obama focused on tightening international sanctions and bolstering alliances with Japan and South Korea. Three weeks in office, the Trump administration is still trying to find its footing on foreign policy, especially in areas like North Korea that have not been Mr. Trump’s main focus. Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson was sworn in on Feb. 1 and does not even have a deputy, much less a full team of trusted advisers, in place. That North Korea’s latest test came while Mr. Trump was hosting Mr. Abe for a multiday set of meetings, meals and golfing, first at the White House and then at Mr. Trump’s    estate in Palm Beach, Fla. was seen as no accident. And it may be that Mr. Abe counseled Mr. Trump on his response. In his own comments while he stood beside Mr. Trump, Mr. Abe called the launch “absolutely intolerable. ” Asia experts and members of Congress praised Mr. Trump for reaffirming American support for Japan but lamented that he did not mention South Korea at the same time. “I was glad he issued the statement with the prime minister of Japan, but he ought to do it quickly with South Korea,” Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic minority leader, said on “Face the Nation” on CBS. “South Korea is probably more susceptible to North Korea’s virulence than any other country. ” White House officials on Sunday remained quiet about the test and their emerging strategy. Stephen Miller, the president’s senior adviser for policy, said Mr. Trump had sent a strong signal with his joint appearance with Mr. Abe. “But we’re going to be sending another signal very soon, and that signal is when we begin a great rebuilding of the armed forces of the United States,” he said, also on “Face the Nation. ” “President Trump is going to go to Congress and ask them to invest in our military so once again we will have unquestioned military strength beyond anything anybody can imagine. ” Short of military action, the menu of options available for Mr. Trump is not significantly better than it was for his predecessors. The United States and the United Nations have already imposed an array of wrenching sanctions and have largely isolated North Korea from much of the world. On his first overseas trip since taking office, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis visited Japan and South Korea to reassure them of America’s support despite statements by Mr. Trump during the campaign that called it into question. South Korean officials agreed to press ahead with development of a new missile defense system called Terminal   Area Defense, or Thaad. Most policy makers consider China crucial to any meaningful response to North Korea, given the nations’ extensive economic and political connections, but it remains uncertain that Mr. Trump would have any better chance of persuading Beijing to take tougher action. Mr. Trump had a   telephone call with President Xi Jinping of China last week and promised to stick by America’s longstanding “One China” policy, reportedly at Mr. Tillerson’s urging. But the president has been an unrelenting critic of China on trade and currency matters, and some of his top advisers, including Stephen K. Bannon, his chief strategist, view China as a   adversary. “We will learn an enormous amount about his policy and his administration by how he deals with North Korea,” said Evan S. Medeiros, a managing director at the Eurasia Group and a former Obama adviser. “It’s the land of really bad options, and the threat is only becoming more serious and the window is closing. It will probably become the defining security challenge for the next president in Asia, if not globally. ”	1
680	 Washington, DC| A security guard of the Smithsonian Museum of Natural History was arrested this morning, for allegedly having sex with one of the mummies of the Egyptian exhibition.44-year old James Monroe, has worked as a night watchman for the reputed museum for the last nine years, and was almost considered a model employee until his divorce two years ago … his superior even noticed that one of the mummies seemed to have been damaged during his watch, leading to the installation of some new video cameras.The cameras caught Mr. Monroe on Monday evening, opening the glass display case protecting the 2500-year old Egyptian mummy, lying down on top of it and sexually aggressing it. The Smithsonian fired the watchman and brought the images to the police, filing charges against their former employee for indecent exposure and destruction of property.“The security video that the Smithsonian has provided us is really disgusting,” says D.C Police Chief, Cathy Lynn Lanier. “I understand that the mummy is not really a victim of sex crimes, but his behavior certainly caused some damages to the property of the Smithsonian, therefore, his behavior is criminal.

420	Life spans in the world’s wealthiest countries will continue to increase in the future, and women in South Korea may be the first to live longer than 90 years on average, a new study has found. The study  —   a mathematical model blending 21 other forecasts and published in The Lancet  —   gave South Korean women born in 2030 a 57 percent chance of hitting the   longevity mark. The surest bet was that they would exceed age 86 on average. Compared with women from 34 other industrialized nations the study assessed, South Korean women generally smoke less, weigh less, have lower blood pressure and see doctors more often because most have health insurance. Women in France, Japan and Spain also were expected to live longer. Currently Japanese women live the longest, but their progress will probably stagnate, the study said. South Korea also led the list for longevity in men, followed by Australia, Switzerland, Canada and the Netherlands men from all of those countries were expected to live beyond 80 on average. The United States, as usual, fared badly. American men and women are in 23rd and 27th place, respectively, in terms of life expectancy, and they were expected to fall farther as other countries, particularly in Eastern Europe, improve. Although the United States has advanced medicine, it has an obesity epidemic, little focus on preventive care, relatively high mortality among babies of uninsured mothers, and high male death rates from gunshot wounds and car accidents. American men live on average about as long as men in Slovenia and Portugal, and average longevity in other countries, including South Korea, the Czech Republic and Hungary, is improving faster. The model assumes that current trends will continue. History often invalidates that assumption, however, because health is tied to political events. Longevity in Africa rose rapidly in the 1950s and ’60s with the spread of antibiotics and vaccines, flattened as the collapse of colonialism bankrupted health care systems, plummeted in the 1990s with the spread of AIDS, and is now rising again as donors pay for AIDS drugs. Among wealthier nations, progress in Eastern Europe followed the collapse of the Soviet Union. South Korea’s projected gains would most likely be seriously compromised if the current tensions with North Korea were to lead to war.	1
240	PALM BEACH, Fla.  —   The sweepstakes for national security adviser expanded on Sunday as President Trump met with four candidates for the job but signaled that he may yet bring more to Florida for interviews. Mr. Trump has been searching for a replacement for Michael T. Flynn, his first national security adviser, who resigned last week at the president’s request because he had misled Vice President Mike Pence and others about a phone call with Russia’s ambassador. The president’s first choice to succeed Mr. Flynn turned down the job, so the White House arranged for four other contenders to fly to his resort,   . Mr. Trump met with John R. Bolton, a former ambassador to the United Nations Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster, a top Army strategist Lt. Gen. Robert L. Caslen Jr. superintendent of the United States Military Academy at West Point and Keith Kellogg, a retired   general serving as acting national security adviser. But Sarah Huckabee Sanders, a White House spokeswoman, said that was not the complete field. “We may have some additional names and meetings” on Monday, she said. She added that Mr. Trump might also summon back one or more of the four he talked with on Sunday for an additional talk. Mr. Trump told reporters on Saturday that he had a favorite, although he did not identify the candidate. “I’ve been thinking about someone for the last three or four days we’ll see what happens,” he said. “I’m meeting with that person. They’re all good they’re all great people. ” In private conversations, the president has praised Mr. Bolton and has noted that many people want him to pick General McMaster, although Mr. Trump seemed convinced that the general had said something unflattering about him during last year’s campaign, according to associates who asked not to be identified sharing private conversations. The White House has had trouble filling some senior positions in part because so many experienced Republicans criticized Mr. Trump during the campaign, and he has vetoed some choices over that. Ms. Sanders said Mr. Trump was entitled to have a team that was on his side. “If you don’t support the president’s agenda, you shouldn’t have a job in the White House,” she said. On a busy holiday weekend, Mr. Trump also attended part of a strategy session on finding a replacement for the Affordable Care Act.	1
729	 As evidence, he pointed to the nation’s urban centers, which generally tend to vote more democratic than suburban or rural areas. “Most people in the cities, they rent,” he said. “They don’t own property. What do they care if they vote a socialist or communist or democrat into office? They don’t even own the building they live in! And you know what else they have in the cities? A lot of black people. Black people who don’t have the good sense to own their own property. And their vote counts the same as yours!”After a supporter in the audience then lamented the advent of early voting, saying it was “an avenue for illegal voting,” Yoho agreed, saying, “I’ve had some radical ideas about voting. You used to have to be a property owner to vote. The founding fathers didn’t have early voting, why should we? We need to go back to what the founding fathers intended. No early voting. No absentee voting. No renters voting. And a black man’s vote counts as ⅗ of a white man’s.”“It’s what God intended,” added Yoho.	0
954	 Disgraced Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein shot and killed himself, officials said — just months after spending time in Arizona for addiction treatment.The film mogul, shot himself at a Scottsdale hotel in Arizona and the weapon reportedly was found at the scene. He was 65. His body was discovered inside the hotel room and officials in Arizona are now waiting for toxicology test results to determine the exact cause of death.Earlier this week, Harvey Weinstein took to Facebook to post about the accusations leveled against him, claiming they were “false” and “only GOD knows the truth.”According to the report, Weinstein, who had been accused of sexual assault by more than 80 women since October is alleged to have earlier sent a private message via facebook to a close pal before his suicide. The content read: “The accusations are sicknesses that will take my life, I cannot handle them any longer. THEY Have Won This Life. BUT HEAVEN IS MY HOME.” The accusations … are false GOD and only GOD knows the truth, nothing is the way they make it out to be. AMERICA will not survive this type of judge and jury fake news. Conservatives take a stand,” the post read. “9-11-2001 NYC/WTC, PTSD 24/7 16 years is a sickness that will take my life, I cannot handle it any longer. IT Has Won This Life . BUT HEAVEN IS MY HOME.	0
606	 Capcom is sponsoring an art installation in East London. That sounds innocuous, except that said art installation is at the Smithfield Meat Market, and is called “Wesker & Son Resident Evil Human Butchery.”Well, that’s certainly one way to get attention for next week’s release of Resident Evil 6.The meat market is not, of course, selling actual human meat, but they are selling meat, mostly pork varieties, rather disturbingly shaped to resemble humans. Along with a variety of human ears, hands, feet, and heads, brave consumers can also purchase carefully recreated sausage fingers and, yes, phalluses. Making generalizations about China’s food industry is difficult. Several thousand modern, large-scale, multinational and joint venture companies and farms that use best practices and sophisticated equipment operate alongside millions of small independent farms, workshops, and merchants that use crude equipment and techniques. China has some 200 million farming households with average land holdings of 1-2 acres per farm and at least 400,000 food processing enterprises, most with 10 or fewer employees. Millions of people and businesses are involved in the handling and transportation of food beyond the farm gate. The vast number of food suppliers increases the challenge of disseminating standards, monitoring production, and tracing problems to their source.	0

476	WASHINGTON  —   Attorney General Jeff Sessions, facing a storm of criticism over newly disclosed contacts with the Russian ambassador to the United States, recused himself on Thursday from any investigation into charges that Russia meddled in the 2016 presidential election. His announcement, delivered at a terse news conference, came after a day of   developments in a murky affair that has shadowed President Trump, jeopardized his closest aides and intensified pressure for a full inquiry into Moscow’s attempts to influence the election as well as the policies of the new administration. Many top Democrats demanded Mr. Sessions’s resignation, and a growing number of Republicans declared that he should not take part in any investigation into the case, given his own still largely unexplained role in it. But Mr. Trump stoutly defended Mr. Sessions, one of his few early champions on Capitol Hill. “He could have stated his response more accurately, but it was clearly not intentional,” he said in a statement, which accused Democrats of engaging in “a total witch hunt. ” Mr. Sessions insisted there was nothing nefarious about his two meetings with the Russian ambassador, Sergey I. Kislyak, even though he did not disclose them to the Senate during his confirmation hearing and they occurred during the heat of the race between Hillary Clinton, the Democratic nominee, and Mr. Trump, whom Mr. Sessions was advising on national security. In his account on Thursday of the more substantive meeting, which took place in his Senate office on Sept. 8, Mr. Sessions described Mr. Kislyak as one of a parade of envoys who seek out lawmakers like him to glean information about American policies and promote the agendas of their governments. “Somehow, the subject of Ukraine came up,” Mr. Sessions said, recalling that the meeting grew testy after the ambassador defended Russia’s conduct toward its neighbor and heaped blame on everybody else. “I thought he was pretty much of an     ambassador,” Mr. Sessions said, noting that he declined a lunch invitation from Mr. Kislyak. Mr. Sessions’s decision to recuse himself was one of his first public acts as attorney general. He said he made the decision after consulting with Justice Department officials, and he denied misleading Senator Al Franken, Democrat of Minnesota, when he said in his confirmation hearing that he had not met with Russian officials about the Trump campaign. “In retrospect,” Mr. Sessions told reporters, “I should have slowed down and said, ‘But I did meet one Russian official a couple of times, and that would be the ambassador.’ ” The latest disclosures  —   and the Trump administration’s contradictory accounts of them  —   have deepened the questions about Russia’s role in the election and its aftermath. The affair has fueled calls for congressional and independent investigations, and toppled another close Trump aide, Michael T. Flynn, who resigned as national security adviser last month after admitting he had misled the administration over his contacts with Mr. Kislyak. On Thursday, the White House confirmed that Mr. Flynn had his own previously undisclosed meeting with the ambassador in December to “establish a line of communication” between the incoming administration and the Russian government. Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump’s    and now a senior adviser, also participated in the meeting at Trump Tower. The extent and frequency of the   contacts remain unclear. But news of the meeting added to the emerging picture of how the relationship between Mr. Trump’s team and Moscow evolved to include some of Mr. Trump’s most trusted advisers. Two other Trump campaign advisers also reportedly spoke with Mr. Kislyak last year at an event on the sidelines of the Republican National Convention. Carter Page, a businessman and early Trump foreign policy adviser, told MSNBC on Thursday, “I’m not going to deny that I talked to him,” but said in an earlier statement that he would not comment about the event, which was off the record. Additionally, J. D. Gordon, a retired naval officer who advised Mr. Trump on national security, told USA Today that he had had an “informal conversation” with Mr. Kislyak, and played down its importance. Mr. Sessions’s decision to recuse himself exposed a rift between the White House and the Justice Department, not only over whether he should do so  —   Mr. Trump said he did not think Mr. Sessions needed to  —   but over the president’s public statements. A Justice Department official confessed puzzlement about why the White House regularly asserted that no one from the Trump campaign had any contact with the Russian government. With Mr. Sessions’s recusal, any Justice Department investigation would be overseen by the deputy attorney general. Dana J. Boente is currently serving in an acting capacity from his role as the chief federal prosecutor for the Eastern District of Virginia. A Senate hearing is scheduled for Tuesday for the nomination of Rod J. Rosenstein as deputy attorney general he would oversee the issue if he is confirmed, and his hearing is now likely to be dominated by questions about the Russia issue. It is not clear if the Justice Department is investigating Russian meddling in the 2016 election, although the F. B. I. is known to have examined possible contacts between Russia and Trump advisers. The House Intelligence Committee has also opened an inquiry into whether Russia tried to influence the election. Mr. Trump said that he “wasn’t aware” that Mr. Sessions had spoken to the ambassador, but that he believed that the attorney general had testified truthfully during his confirmation hearing. “I think he probably did,” Mr. Trump told reporters, while touring the Gerald R. Ford, the newest American aircraft carrier, in Newport News, Va. Asked whether Mr. Sessions should recuse himself from the investigations, the president said, “I don’t think so. ” Within Mr. Trump’s inner circle, Mr. Flynn appears to have been the primary interlocutor with the Russian envoy. The two were in contact during the campaign and the transition, Mr. Kislyak and current and former American officials have said. But Mr. Sessions served as the chairman of Mr. Trump’s national security committee  —   a post Democrats said would have made him a much   figure for officials from many foreign countries. There is nothing unusual about meetings between presidential campaigns and foreign diplomats. Mr. Kislyak was one of several envoys at the Republican National Convention, where his first meeting with Mr. Sessions, according to the attorney general, was a brief encounter after a panel organized by the Heritage Foundation. Ambassadors also attended the Democratic convention, though it was not clear whether Mr. Kislyak was among them. “Active embassies here consider it as their assignment to stretch out feelers to presidential hopefuls,” said Peter Wittig, the German ambassador, who met most of the Republican candidates, though not Mr. Trump. “I don’t consider it as something unusual or problematic. ” The trouble in Mr. Sessions’s case is that his meeting came as the nation’s intelligence agencies were concluding that Russia had tried to destabilize the election and help Mr. Trump. Mr. Sessions’s initial lack of disclosure of the meetings with Mr. Kislyak fed suspicions that it was more than     diplomacy. The disclosure, first reported by The Washington Post, contradicted forceful and repeated denials from the White House that anyone from the Trump campaign had discussions with the Russians. “I have nothing to do with Russia,” Mr. Trump said at a news conference on Feb. 20. “To the best of my knowledge, no person that I deal with does. ” Asked at the news conference on Thursday whether he and the ambassador had discussed Mr. Trump or the election, Mr. Sessions said, “I don’t recall. ” Ambassadors are “pretty gossipy,” he said, and “this was in campaign season, but I don’t recall any specific political discussions. ” Mr. Sessions noted that he was joined by two retired Army colonels on his staff, as well as perhaps a younger staff member. He said they opened with small talk about Mr. Sessions’s visit to Russia with a church group in 1991. “He said he was not a believer himself, but he was glad to have church people come there,” Mr. Sessions recalled. That meeting came during the waning months of the campaign. But the meeting two months later of Mr. Kushner, Mr. Flynn and Mr. Kislyak came at an arguably more crucial time, with Mr. Trump as the   and the Obama White House preparing to impose sanctions on Russia and publicly make its case that Moscow had interfered with the election. What is becoming clear is that the incoming Trump administration was simultaneously striking a conciliatory pose toward Moscow in a series of meetings and calls involving Mr. Kislyak. “They generally discussed the relationship, and it made sense to establish a line of communication,” said Hope Hicks, a White House spokeswoman. “Jared has had meetings with many other foreign countries and representatives  —   as many as two dozen other foreign countries’ leaders and representatives. ” The Trump Tower meeting lasted 20 minutes, and Mr. Kushner has not met since with Mr. Kislyak, Ms. Hicks said. At Mr. Sessions’s confirmation hearing, Mr. Franken asked him about a CNN report that after the election, intelligence briefers had told President Barack Obama and Mr. Trump that Russian operatives claimed to have compromising information about Mr. Trump. Mr. Franken also noted that the report indicated that surrogates for Mr. Trump and intermediaries for the Russian government continued to exchange information during the campaign. He asked Mr. Sessions what he would do if that report proved true. Mr. Sessions replied that he was “not aware of any of those activities. ” He added, “I have been called a surrogate at a time or two in that campaign, and I didn’t have  —   did not have communications with the Russians, and I’m unable to comment on it. ” On Thursday, Mr. Sessions said he did not view Mr. Kislyak’s visit as tied to his campaign role, but he acknowledged, “I can’t speak for what the Russian ambassador may have had in his mind. ”	1
246	It was a stunning act of terror, an assault on the World Trade Center that shook New York City. The long wake of its memory still slices through those who were there and the families of those who died. That was 1993. Roughly eight years before the twin towers were destroyed in the Sept. 11 attacks, the buildings were badly damaged on a snowy afternoon by a truck bomb in a basement garage that killed six people. On Saturday, Omar Abdel Rahman  —   a blind cleric whose fiery speech exhorted   violence and galvanized those who executed the attack, according to prosecutors  —   died at 78 in a federal prison in North Carolina. He was serving a life sentence for plotting a series of assaults never carried out: bombs to be set in tunnels and buildings in an attack designed to bring New York to its knees. In the city, news of his death, from complications of diabetes and coronary artery disease, has caused many who experienced the bombing, whether as rescuers, government officials or witnesses, to recall the smoke and the gaping crater. They have also been led to consider something more existential: a February afternoon when, in an instant, the city experienced a sensation now all too familiar but then quite new  —   vulnerability. “Those who went through the ’93 experience remember it as the beginning of the loss of innocence,” said Anthony E. Shorris, then the first deputy executive director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. After the blast, Mr. Shorris spent a month inside the   crater in the garage beneath the World Trade Center plaza as teams shored it up and the police dug for bodies. “Remembering a time when we didn’t think things like this could happen, and now we think about it all the time,” Mr. Shorris, now the deputy mayor of New York City, said. He paused. “All the time. ” The explosion, on Feb. 26, 1993, injured about 1, 000 people and could be heard on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. The percussion was felt, some said, even farther north than Harlem. But New Yorkers thought of vehicle bombings as something that happened elsewhere. At first, the city sought more innocent explanations. Stanley Brezenoff, then the executive director of the Port Authority, which owned the World Trade Center property and had offices on the 65th floor, said: “People walked out of their offices and looked at each other. ‘Did something happen? Did a generator go out? Was there some kind of a storm that we weren’t aware of? ’” He made the call to evacuate, and staff members carried a colleague in a wheelchair down more than 20 flights. “I don’t think we stopped to reflect on the enormity of what happened,” said Mr. Brezenoff, now the interim head of the New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation. The Port Authority launched an   effort to repair the stricken tower, reopening it in a month. “A lot of the response was, ‘They can’t do that to us,’” Mr. Brezenoff said. “It sounds almost quaint now. ” Raymond W. Kelly, who was then at the start of the first of his two stints as police commissioner, said, “In terms of modern terrorism, the threat was there, but I don’t think it was seen as a threat to this country. ” The sense was, he said, “it was going on in other places. ” It took about a day to definitively determine the blast was terrorism, and even then, the city was unsure who its enemies were, Mr. Kelly said. Speculation about their origin included the former Yugoslavia and the Middle East. The office of the governor at the time, Mario M. Cuomo, was on the 57th floor of 2 World Trade Center. After the boom, no one there panicked, mostly because it “never occurred to us that it would be a bomb,” said Deborah Sale, who was chief of staff to Stan Lundine, then the lieutenant governor. Using their limited knowledge from infrequent fire drills and holding on to handrails, employees gingerly crept down the stairs, Ms. Sale said. “There was no power at all, and it was pitch black,” she said, recalling that she had used a scarf to cover her nose and mouth in the smoky stairwell. The new reality of terrorism led to changes in the towers themselves. Afterward, emergency lights were installed, and screenings were added for people entering the building. Norman Steisel, who was first deputy mayor at the time, said the safety improvements saved lives on Sept. 11. “Those buildings were evacuated pretty quickly,” he said, referring to the floors below where the planes had hit. “Just imagine if more and more people were trapped downstairs. ” In 1995, Mr. Abdel Rahman was convicted, along with nine others, on charges of seditious conspiracy in Federal District Court in Manhattan for a plot to bomb landmarks and infrastructure hubs, although the plans were never carried out. While prosecutors asserted he had been involved in the 1993 attack, six other men  were convicted after the vehicle identification number from a rental van linked to the perpetrators was found in the rubble. Mr. Kelly said he believed the conspirators’ web of connections to groups like Al Qaeda had not been fully mined, even though data was discovered linking some to a somewhat obscure leader. His name was Osama bin Laden. “It should have been a huge   call for the federal government and the city, and it wasn’t,” he said. “And we paid the price on Sept. 11. ” Although Mr. Abdel Rahman’s name has over time become linked in many minds to the 1993 attack, it has not for Lynne F. Stewart, his defense lawyer in his 1995 trial. She believes he is innocent. Ms. Stewart was convicted in 2005 of smuggling messages on behalf of the imprisoned sheikh and sentenced to a decade in prison, which she began serving about seven years ago. She was released in 2014 when a judge reduced her sentence after a diagnosis of terminal cancer. Speaking from her hospital bed in Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan a few days after the sheikh’s death, Ms. Stewart expressed the view that Mr. Abdel Rahman’s fiery rhetoric was a matter of free speech, a belief shared by many in the Arab world. “We can name a lot of names in American history where people were convicted of not doing anything, and he is just the latest in a long line of American heroes who were convicted wrongfully,” she said.	1
328	Ernie Els, known as the Big Easy, created a little strife on social media this month by playing golf with President Trump and Japan’s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, at Trump National Golf Club in Jupiter, Fla. As the PGA Tour moves this week to PGA National Resort and Spa, a   drive from Trump National, it was natural to wonder: How many of Els’s peers on the tour, if extended the same invitation, would say yes? At Riviera Country Club in Los Angeles last week, I asked more than   of the Genesis Open field that question, granting the respondents anonymity so they wouldn’t risk the wrath of their Twitter followers or, in the case of at least one pro, the fury of his wife. The players range in age from the early 20s to late 40s. They represent nine countries and make their homes in 14 American states, including four that voted overwhelmingly Democratic in last year’s presidential election. Of the 56 players polled, 50  —   or 89. 3 percent  —   said they would play golf with Trump if asked. Only three said they would not. The remaining three declined to answer. The results were hardly surprising. The clubhouses at PGA Tour stops have long trended Republican, and the sport’s target demographic  —   rich, mostly white men  —   is far different from the women, minorities, immigrants and Muslims who have at times been the most offended by the president’s statements and positions. Long before he was elected the country’s 45th president, Trump participated in tournament   on the men’s and women’s tours and made the game an integral part of his lifestyle and his businesses. His presidency, at least so far, has been no different. But the current political climate is forcing many   people who sometimes enter the White House’s orbit  —   celebrities, N. F. L. players, even college basketball stars  —   to seriously consider the personal and public repercussions of accepting an invitation to engage with the president. “I’m not silly to what’s going on,” said Els, who was born in South Africa. “I know this is probably the most polarizing president of my time. ” He added, “Whether you agree or not, I felt it was a duty to play with the president when you get the call. ” Els, 47, is married with two teenage children, and lives in West Palm Beach, Fla. He is also a member of Trump’s golf club in Jupiter, which might have made him a logical recipient for an invitation: Els said he received his in a phone call from David Trout, the head professional at Trump National, asking if he would be interested in rounding out a foursome the next day that included the president. Els, who was home because he had pulled out of that week’s PGA Tour event in Pebble Beach, Calif. with a stiff neck, said he was not going to pass up three hours of exclusive access to the leader of the free world. “He is the president at the moment,” Els said. “If it was Barack Obama, I would have played. If it was Hillary Clinton, I would have played. ” Since the November election, Trump has played with at least one L. P. G. A. player, Lexi Thompson, and three former men’s world No. 1s: Tiger Woods Els and Rory McIlroy of Northern Ireland, who has a home in Palm Beach Gardens and is recovering from a rib injury. McIlroy played 18 holes with the president on Sunday at Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach, in a foursome that also included the former Yankees outfielder Paul O’Neill. Woods, who has played with former Presidents George Bush, Bill Clinton and Obama, described his December round with Trump as “fun” in a blog post on his website, and added, “Our discussion topics were  . ” Other players said they would welcome a similar opportunity. Pat Perez, an   golfer of Mexican ancestry, is an unabashed supporter of Trump, whom he described as “an incredible businessman who knows what he’s doing. ” Perez said he would play with Trump “in a heartbeat,” but would have turned down an invitation from Mrs. Clinton if she had won. (It should be noted that she is not known to golf.) Trump is perhaps the most ardent golfer to occupy the Oval Office since the 34th president, Dwight D. Eisenhower, who had a putting green installed at the White House and carried a club like a walking stick as he made his way through its maze of hallways. Eisenhower, who was a member at Augusta National, occasionally played with Arnold Palmer. Trump enjoys the company of Jim Herman. In 2006, Herman was hired as an assistant pro at Trump’s course in Bedminster, N. J. He played a few rounds with Trump, who was impressed with his game. Trump encouraged Herman to redouble his efforts to earn a place on the PGA Tour and helped bankroll his career at the start. Last year, Herman won his first tour title. Since 2008, his combined earnings on the PGA Tour and Web. com Tour are more than $6 million. Herman, 39, has played hundreds of rounds with Trump over the last decade. During one of their games after the election, Trump invited him to the inauguration. “It’s still very hard for me to separate ‘President Donald Trump’ from the guy I’ve played with for the last 10 years,” Herman said, adding, “I think of how generous Mr. Trump and all of those people were in helping me make it to the PGA Tour. So on that day in Washington, the inauguration was almost surreal in seeing him and his children and some members of his clubs I hadn’t seen in many years, all of us back together to share in that unique moment in American history. ” The PGA Tour once held a World Golf Championships event, a rung below the four majors in prestige, at Trump National Doral outside Miami, but last year it moved the tournament, starting this year, to Mexico City after the title sponsor, Cadillac, declined to renew its contract. As Cadillac discovered, any brand can end up as collateral damage when it comes in contact with a   missile like Trump. When the tournament’s move was announced last summer, the perception  —   denied by tour officials  —   was that the organization was using the sponsorship vacuum to distance itself from Trump, who had made incendiary comments about Mexicans and women during the presidential campaign. After Mexico City was announced as the event’s new home, McIlroy, alluding to Trump’s campaign pledge to build a wall along the border, joked, “We’ll just jump over the wall. ” That McIlroy chose to play golf with Trump despite having said before last year’s event at Doral that if he were a United States citizen, “I’m not sure I would want to vote for any of the candidates,” did not surprise the former player Justin Leonard. Leonard, a reporter for Golf Channel and NBC, said, “I think seeing the president take time out of what we can only imagine being such a busy schedule and placing importance on golf from a business and social level, and for guys like Rory to take the time  —   obviously he’s been battling an injury, but that’s a call that you don’t turn down. ”	1

387	Savory tarts can be dainty things, eaten on your finest china with a pinkie in the air. But not this one. Loaded with roasted vegetables and cheese on a   crust, it’s a hearty meal that you can eat out of hand, with your pinkie occupied by holding the slice. It’s gorgeous, too. With a mixture of velvety butternut squash, earthy mushrooms and sweet green leeks, this tart makes for an especially pretty yet satisfying vegetarian meal. The crust is made with yeast, which is what really makes this tart rustic, rather than refined. If working with yeast makes you nervous, this recipe is a good place to begin. The dough is so simple you can mix it by hand with a wooden spoon and then knead it for just a few minutes, until it starts to spring back when you pull it. It should be somewhat elastic but not bouncy. Think Silly Putty rather than Spaulding. Then set the dough aside to rise. The warmer your room, the less time it will take to double in bulk. In a cold room it could take two or three hours, whereas a warm room gets the job done in half that amount of time. Or let it rise in the fridge overnight. It’s a very adaptable recipe. The   flour in the dough gives it heft, along with a gentle nuttiness. I like either   or rye flour here, but you can substitute spelt or einkorn. Just be sure to use a flour with gluten in it. In this particular recipe,   flours (brown rice, millet, oat) won’t bake up as pleasingly chewy. I’ve topped the tart with mushrooms, leeks and winter squash, all roasted before they meet the crust. This is an important step. You want to roast the vegetables until they are almost, but not quite, caramelized. They should be pale golden at the edges and tender in the center when you pull them from the oven, but not thoroughly browned because they will continue to cook when you bake them on the crust. You can roast the vegetables up to eight hours in advance, but the tart itself is best made within an hour or two of serving. That’s when the crust is at its most crisp and the cheese still soft and oozing. That said, you can still enjoy the tart the next day, especially if you reheat it. Leftover and cold, eaten wrapped in a napkin on your way out the door, this robust tart can hold its own. Recipe: Roasted Mushroom and Butternut Squash Tart And to Drink . .. This savory tart presents a challenge. Mushrooms go beautifully with red wines, while leeks, squash and cheese all cry out for whites. Pick whichever you prefer, but avoid tannic reds and oaky whites. In reds, I would look for something fruity and balanced: Pinot noir would be great, as would Beaujolais, young Riojas and the more restrained American grenaches and carignans. You could try monastrells and other wines from southeastern Spain, and Valpolicellas from Italy. Among whites, I would look at dry chenin blancs from the Loire Valley, unoaked chardonnays and possibly rieslings from Austria or Alsace. A dry sparkling wine would also be excellent. ERIC ASIMOV	1
360	There are more than 160 swear words in Andy Weir’s   thriller, “The Martian,” including two memorably deployed   in the novel’s first three sentences. The profanity did not strike Mr. Weir as excessive when he wrote the book nearly a decade ago. After all, the story’s narrator, an astronaut named Mark Watney, is stranded alone on Mars with a dwindling supply of food and a rescue mission that is four years away  —   circumstances that warrant constant cursing. But shortly after the book came out, Mr. Weir started hearing from a subset of readers who objected to the obscenities. “I got a lot of emails from science teachers who said, ‘Man I’d love to use your book as a teaching aid, but there’s so much profanity in it that we can’t really do that,’” said Mr. Weir, 44, who is cheerful,   and casually profane, much like his protagonist. “It’s hard to get that by a school board. ” Apart from the   words, “The Martian” is a science teacher’s dream text. It’s a gripping survival story that hinges on the hero’s ability to solve a series of complex problems, using his knowledge of physics, chemistry, astronomy and math, in order to stay alive on a hostile planet. (The Washington Post called the novel “an advertisement for the importance of STEM education. ”) After getting dozens of inquiries from teachers, Mr. Weir, who describes himself as “a lifelong space nerd,” asked his publisher, Crown, if they could release a   edition of the book. The novel was pretty easy to amend, by simply replacing the foul language with tamer words like “screwed,” “jerk” and “crap” (Mr. Weir said there were “occasional squabbles” when he tried to lobby the censors to keep some of the less offensive swear words in.) A   version came out last year, and it is now being used to help teach science in classrooms around the country. At Synergy Quantum Academy, a public charter high school in South Los Angeles, students are conducting experiments based on the novel. In physics class, students will build miniature   cars, and during astronomy next month, they will try to grow potatoes as Watney did, using a chamber modeled on NASA’s Lunar Plant Growth Chamber. Eighth graders at Oak Middle School in Los Alamitos, Calif. are following a yearlong curriculum based on “The Martian,” with lesson plans that use dramatic moments in the narrative to illustrate concepts like Newton’s laws of motion, chemical reactions and spacecraft engineering. In a science class at Northwestern High School in Mellette, S. D. sophomores are using the novel as a   point for some   experiments, like splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen. “It’s really exciting for them to see the connection between the novel and the science they’re learning,” said Denise Clemens, a science teacher at Northwestern. “Hopefully we’re not going to blow anything up. ” Her students seem happy to have an alternative to dry science textbooks. “It’s been a really good way to understand ionic compounds and bonds and all the things you can do with chemistry,” Jarret Haven, 16, said of studying “The Martian. ” “It’s really opened up my mind. ” For Mr. Weir and his publisher, getting the book into schools opens up a lucrative new market that could turn “The Martian,” which was already a blockbuster that sold several million copies, into a perennial best seller that guarantees a   audience every year. Mr. Weir did not set out to write a science textbook. A college dropout and former software engineer who is fascinated by space exploration, Mr. Weir started writing “The Martian” in 2009, mainly to entertain himself. The story grew out of a thought experiment, when Mr. Weir began imagining what a scientifically feasible manned mission to Mars would look like. The story took shape as Mr. Weir tried to work out what it would take to get to Mars, and how to keep a stranded astronaut alive on the planet (the creative use of duct tape is key). “Oftentimes, when I was   the math, I would discover problems that I hadn’t thought of that Watney would run into,” he said. He wrote computer software to work out what the constant thrust trajectories would be for the spaceship’s ion engine, and studied NASA satellite images to map out Watney’s treacherous   kilometer course across Mars in a rover. He also calculated how many calories Watney would need to stay alive, how much water he would need to grow potatoes, and how he could manufacture water out of oxygen and hydrazine, a compound used for rocket fuel. Mr. Weir had failed to sell an earlier attempt at a novel, so rather than trying to get “The Martian” published, he serialized it for free on his website. Some of his fans urged him to list it on Amazon, and he began selling it for 99 cents. He quickly sold 35, 000 copies, and started getting inquiries from publishers and agents. Crown bought the novel and published it in 2014. A feature film adaptation, directed by Ridley Scott and starring Matt Damon as Watney, came out the next year and grossed more than $630 million worldwide. The novel sold more than three million copies, and has racked up more than 29, 500 reviews on Amazon. Crown has printed nearly 30, 000 copies of the classroom edition, which comes with a teacher’s guide that lists discussion questions and activities and includes an interview with Mr. Weir about the science behind the story. Next month, Mr. Weir will address science teachers at the National Science Teachers Association’s conference in Los Angeles, and his publisher will give away around 500 copies of the classroom edition of the “The Martian. ” David Beck, a science teacher at Oak Middle School, was one of the teachers who lobbied Mr. Weir for a sanitized version of the story. After he first read “The Martian” two years ago, Mr. Beck immediately wanted to create a curriculum based on the novel. “I thought, I could teach all of my   physical science out of this book,” he said. He proposed using the novel in his class to the school’s principal, who loved the idea but thought the foul language could be a problem. They approached the district school board to see if they could assign the novel to students, and were turned down. (They even considered buying copies of the novel and redacting the swear words by hand with markers, but decided against it.) Mr. Beck then emailed Mr. Weir and later, his publisher, and asked if they had considered releasing a PG edition for students. At that point, similar requests were piling up. Crown wanted to wait until after the movie adaptation came out, to avoid confusing retailers and readers. When Broadway Books, a Crown imprint, published the school edition in 2016, Mr. Beck created a yearlong curriculum for the school’s 380 eighth graders, who each got a copy of the book. So far, the students have been enthusiastic, and many have finished the novel ahead of schedule. Some teachers are skeptical that students need to be shielded from the profanity in “The Martian. ” Marc Montalbano, an English teacher at Tottenville High School in Staten Island, said he was using the original version of “The Martian” with his seniors, who are also drawing on the text for science research projects. Watney’s swearing makes him seem more relatable as a character and helps offset the heavy science, Mr. Montalbano said in an email. Nora Groft, a high school English teacher at Northwestern, said she taught the classroom edition of “The Martian,” but told her students that a version with more adult language was available, too, and that the curse words might be appropriate, given the context. “Imagine if you were stranded on Mars,” she said. “Do you think you’d say, ‘Goshdarnit’?”	1

759	   As of November 13th, 234 people have been reported dead after consumption of the famous Patti’s Sweet Potato Pie, which are being pulled off of the shelves of Wal-Mart stores. The popular desert rose to fame after a video review of the pie went viral.According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, approximately 100,000 pies produced in October and November were tainted with Tetrodotoxin, a venomous substance found in the blue ringed octopus and puff fish. The venom is tasteless and can kill a human being within minutes of consumption. Moments after consumption, a victim will become paralyzed and blood flow to the brain is immediately stopped.According to the CDC, the pies were produced in the same factory that thousands of puffer fish are devenomized and prepared. The CDC and FDA are currently running an investigation on the factory to find out how the pies were tainted. In the meantime, the company has issued a recall on the pies and Walmart will be accepting returns.  	0
173	WASHINGTON  —   In an extraordinarily swift return to politicking after a tumultuous first month in office, the White House on Wednesday said President Trump will hold the first campaign rally of his    administration on Saturday. The rally, to be held in an airplane hangar in Melbourne, Fla. is an indication that Mr. Trump, who has sometimes felt isolated in the White House, is eager to get outside of Washington and relive the rapturous reception that greeted him during the presidential campaign. Mr. Trump exulted in large crowds assembled at cavernous venues throughout his 2016 bid, and spent the first days of his presidency quibbling over how many Americans attended his inauguration. On Wednesday, during a joint news conference with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, Mr. Trump answered a question about whether his administration was flirting with xenophobia and racism in part by noting the support he received in the election. “I just want to say that we are very honored by the victory that we had  —   306 Electoral College votes,” Mr. Trump said. “There’s tremendous enthusiasm out there. ” Not long after, in a posting on Twitter, Mr. Trump invited his nearly 25 million followers to attend the Saturday evening event, which will take place just up the coast from his    retreat in Palm Beach where he plans to spend the weekend. It will be his third weekend in a row on Florida’s Gold Coast. “We are going to put America back to work,” a message accompanying the posting said. “We are going to put people before government. ” The White House would not provide any additional information about the rally. Officials referred questions to a member of Mr. Trump’s political organization, who also did not immediately respond to a request for comment. “It’s being run by the campaign,” Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, said on Wednesday, without elaborating. He would not say why the president would be holding a campaign rally so soon after taking office. The rally will be only the second public appearance by Mr. Trump outside of Washington since he took office. On Friday, he is scheduled to visit a Boeing plant in North Charleston, S. C. for the unveiling of the aerospace manufacturer’s new Dreamliner aircraft. Mr. Trump filed paperwork with the Federal Election Commission for his 2020   campaign on Jan. 20, the day he was sworn in. That allowed him to continue to accept contributions  —   including proceeds from the sales of his popular red “Make America Great Again” hats  —   without running afoul of the law. Mr. Trump ended the 2016 campaign flush with funds, in part because of substantial sales of the hats. At the end of 2016, he had $7, 611, 702. 92 cash on hand and no debt. The rally comes at a precarious time for Mr. Trump, as his White House is reeling from personnel turmoil and has yet to score any legislative victories. On Tuesday, he accepted the resignation of his national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn, who had become embroiled in allegations that he had improper contacts with Russian officials before Mr. Trump took office. That was followed on Wednesday by the abrupt withdrawal of Andrew F. Puzder, the president’s nominee to be secretary of labor, amid allegations that he had abused his   and employed an illegal immigrant. Mr. Trump had vowed to move quickly to put his policy agenda in place once in the White House. But his effort to use executive power to crack down on immigration has faltered in the face of legal challenges, and his administration has yet to issue a proposal either for repealing the health care law he railed against during the campaign or enacting the tax overhaul he has promised. Larry M. Noble, the general counsel of the Campaign Legal Center, a nonpartisan group, said he was not aware of any president having held a campaign rally this early in his tenure. “Usually, they are too busy trying to get their administration in place,” Mr. Noble said. “More importantly, normally the president wants to delay candidate status so that he can travel as president making speeches, announcing new policies and actions, promoting his agenda and attacking his opponents in Congress without having to use campaign funds. ” Barack Obama did not file his statement of candidacy for   until April 2011, more than two years after he took office, while George W. Bush waited until May of 2003 and Bill Clinton until April of 1995. Mr. Trump may be moving now, Mr. Noble said, to ensure he can address a friendly crowd devoid of protesters. “My guess is that he intends to control who is invited to the rally and press access by calling the rally a candidate event and paying for it out of campaign funds,” Mr. Noble said. “If it was an official White House event, he would have less control over it. ” Mr. Trump is likely to travel to the event on Air Force One and will have a sizable contingent of Secret Service and staff aides with him, as presidents always do when they travel. Campaign finance laws dictate that the cost of such a flight be shared between the campaign organizing the rally and the White House. It is not abnormal for a sitting president to hold a political rally in the months before an election, and Mr. Trump has said he plans to campaign actively for Republicans who support him and against Democrats who seek to stymie his agenda. But Mr. Trump’s return to the campaign trail on Saturday is unusually early. Even the midterm congressional elections for members of Congress are still 21 months away.	1
247	The hardest thing about the          decision may be when parents have to make the call: It’s usually during the family’s tightly orchestrated morning routine. “It’s kind of hard to make that judgment in the morning,” said Dr. Timothy Shope, an associate professor of pediatrics at Children’s Hospital of Pittsburgh, who is the   of the American Academy of Pediatrics book “Managing Infectious Diseases in Child Care and Schools: A Quick Reference Guide. ” “Sometimes very   parents have only a short window to make a judgment before they have to activate their day, get the child on the bus,” he said. And those parents may be feeling pressure to get to their own jobs. In a poll of parents conducted by C. S. Mott Children’s Hospital in Michigan and released last month, parents were asked about how they make that decision. Concern about the illness getting worse if the child went to school was very important to 60 percent of the parents, followed by concern that the child’s classmates might get sick (47 percent). This was especially true for parents of younger   children, 6 to 9 years old. Parents of older children, not surprisingly, tended to worry more about children falling behind or missing a test. Parents also worried about logistics 11 percent cited not wanting to miss work as very important in the decision, and parents worried about finding someone to stay home with a sick child, especially those with younger children. “The most important thing to parents in the decision was the health of their child and the health of other children,” said Dr. Gary L. Freed, the   of the poll. “That took precedence over the proportion of parents who were concerned about missing work. ” In terms of specific symptoms, parents said they would keep kids home for diarrhea (80 percent) or vomiting (58 percent would keep a child home for having thrown up once, even if there were no other symptoms) or for having a slight fever, even if acting normal (49 percent). But worrying too much about what may evolve over the course of the day, or even about other children getting sick, should not get in the way of assessing how your own child is looking right now, in the morning. “I think there are more overprotective parents than there are parents who send their kids to school too easily,” Dr. Shope said. “The primary concern I have as a pediatrician is that the parent make a decision about whether the child can effectively participate in the school day. ” That would rule out a child who is vomiting, of course, or a child who is miserable and feverish, and many school districts do have specific illness policies about symptoms like these. As far as spreading infection, the bad news is that many infectious illnesses are infectious well before symptoms appear, and continue to be transmitted after the child has recovered, while some children don’t get sick at all, but do continue to carry  —   and spread  —   viruses and bacteria that can make other children sick. Children should get their flu shots every fall that can prevent a great deal of misery and school absence. But there are a lot of other viruses out there, and infections can be spread by children who aren’t sick, or aren’t yet sick, or aren’t still sick. So we have to prevent transmission by emphasizing habits that improve hygiene and interrupt possible transmission, or, as we would say in the medical setting, infection control. And the good news is that as children get older, they can learn these techniques, which make even a symptomatic child much less dangerous to others. It is not, as we say, rocket science. Respiratory etiquette means coughing or sneezing into a sleeve or an elbow. And after immunizations, the single most important way to prevent transmission of infections in schools is the same as it is in hospitals (where you don’t have the option of excluding the sick people) good hand hygiene:   when possible, hand sanitizer as a backup. “Encourage families to understand the importance of   in both keeping their children healthier and also the children their children encounter,” Dr. Freed said. One suggestion is to teach children to lather for long enough to sing “Row, Row, Row Your Boat” or “Happy Birthday” twice. Hand hygiene is important for respiratory illnesses, which are most likely to be transmitted by viruses that get (mysteriously) from the mouth and nose onto the hands, and from there to other objects, from doorknobs to papers to pencils. But it’s also very important to prevent the spread of stomach problems a child who has diarrhea but practices good hand hygiene is much less likely to cause problems for anyone else, while an asymptomatic child could be incubating and spreading a GI infection. So we have to focus on what happens at the sink. The other good news, I suppose, though it can be hard for parents to appreciate this when they’re in the throes of negotiating who stays home and skips work, is that the infections that children get do build up their immune system capacity and make it less likely that they will get sick later on. It’s also important for parents to remember that if you make the   decision to send a child to school, and then get that dreaded call from the school nurse, you haven’t made a terrible mistake or shown yourself to be a bad or uncaring parent. “You can’t beat yourself up for not knowing the course a condition is going to take,” Dr. Freed said. As a pediatrician, I am very familiar with the sinking feeling that comes when you hear that a child you thought was doing fine has in fact gotten sicker. As a parent, you have to make the best assessment you can in the window you have. Dr. Shope said: “It’s not really a doctor decision, it’s a parent decision. ”	1

38	NICE, France  —     Rivère accepts the compliment, but rejects the comparison. Rivère, the president of OGC Nice, can see why his team, this season, has been cast as France’s equivalent to Leicester City. He knows their stories follow the same arc: a provincial David defying overwhelming financial obstacles to outwit Goliath. He appreciates that the parallel is intended as praise, a convenient, flattering shorthand to explain the scale of Nice’s achievement in competing with Monaco and Paris   at the summit of France’s Ligue 1 over the last six months, maintaining a title challenge despite a budget that is a small fraction of its two bigger, richer rivals’. Sitting in an office at the back of Nice’s official club store, though, Rivère does not indulge the comparison for long. What Leicester did in winning the Premier League last season, he says, came from the realms of fantasy. It was an alignment of the stars, one that can no more be explained than it can be repeated. Nice, he is convinced, is different. If Leicester was a wonderful accident, Nice’s metamorphosis is entirely by design. From the outside, it is tempting  —   though misguided  —   to put a specific date on Nice’s ascendance: Aug. 31, 2016 (more on that below). In reality, the club has been growing, slowly and steadily, ever since Rivère, a real estate magnate, took control in 2011. When he arrived, he said, it was a “club with a bad reputation, without a strategy, a club in perdition. ” He has changed all of that. Nice moved into a new stadium, the     Allianz Riviera, in 2013. Rivère is overseeing the construction of a new training facility. He has even delivered on his promise to find outside investment, having sold 80 percent of the club to a consortium of Chinese and American investors. Results on the field have consistently improved, too, culminating in last season’s   finish under Coach Claude Puel. When Puel left last summer for Southampton  —   a more apposite English parallel for Nice  —   Rivère persuaded Lucien Favre, an astute Swiss coach who had led Borussia Mönchengladbach to the Champions League, to replace him. “Like Puel, he was not at the level of Nice when he arrived,” Rivère said. “He was much higher. ” The squad Favre inherited was one of youth and promise, yet he has lifted it to another plane despite a wide disparity in resources. Nice’s annual budget is $45 million. Monaco’s is three times that, and P. S. G. ’s more than 10 times as large. Nice, though, has led the league for much of the season. A place in the Champions League next season now looks like the least of its ambitions. The spotlight, though, always prefers to fixate on hares, rather than tortoises. It was only on Aug. 31, when Rivère confirmed the arrival of Mario Balotelli, the enigmatic,   Italian striker, that the rest of the world sat up and took notice of what was happening on the Riviera. The year before, Nice had signed an equally tempestuous character, the France winger Hatem Ben Arfa. The move piqued interest in France, and a degree of curiosity from the rest of Europe. Balotelli was another order of magnitude. Dozens of reporters descended on the Riviera. L’Équipe, the French sports daily, devoted five pages to the signing. Nice’s name flashed around the planet. “With Ben Arfa, it was Europe,” Rivère said. “With Balotelli, it was the world. ” Much of the coverage, naturally, centered on Balotelli’s reputation, his truculence and his rebelliousness. Many felt that Nice  —   like Liverpool, Milan and Manchester City before it  —   would struggle to control Balotelli, to restore his focus. The move was dismissed, in some quarters, as a publicity stunt. Rivère was more confident. “I do not often do this,” he said, “but I looked at everything that had been said about him. I asked to see the videos of his matches, the good and the bad. I saw 20 bad things and just one good thing. “One day, after training at Manchester City, he met a small boy. He asked him what he was doing there, and the boy said he did not want to go to school, because he had been bullied. So Balotelli took the boy to school in his car, so the boy could feel like a star, and sorted out the problem. I said that if he had done this, he must have a good heart. ” Rivère has been proved right: Working to a customized training plan, Balotelli has thrived, emerging as a central plank of Nice’s title challenge. He has scored 11 goals in 18 games though there have been controversies, they have happened to him, rather than because of him: a red card that was later rescinded, and racial abuse directed toward him during a game at Bastia. “When a player arrives, I guarantee only one thing: that if they come to play here, they will find a family club, a good atmosphere, a good group,” Rivère said. “They will find a smile. “When you have a player who is in trouble, the problem is often in the head, not the feet,” he continued. “If you had talent in the past and lost it, with us you have more chance of rediscovering the pleasure of playing football. ” That is not to say Rivère is running some sort of corrective institution for the chronically wayward. Nice benefits from Balotelli just as much as he benefits from Nice, if not more on the field, of course, but off it, too. Rivère referred to the Italian as a marketing “accelerator. ” That is particularly important as the club tries to grow. Nice is one of the oldest soccer teams in France, and one of the proudest, too: It is the only French club with its own anthem  —   “Nissa la Bella,” or “Beautiful Nice,” in Niçois dialect. When its new stadium opened, Nice arranged for the turf from the center circle at its old home, the Stade du Ray, to be laid into the field, a symbolic gesture by club officials to worried fans that though the location had changed, Nice’s heart remained the same. And yet the city seems too genteel, too well heeled, to feel as   as Marseille, for example, a couple of hours down the Côte d’Azur. Soccer tends to thrive where it is the single unifying factor at first glance, that is not the case in Nice. The mountains are an hour away, Monte Carlo even less. There are beaches and nightclubs, money and glamour. All act as competition. So signing Balotelli was not just a way to garner international attention, but another effort to draw fans away from the various other delights of the area and into the stadium. “We try to make matches a complete experience,” Rivère said. He has always demanded that the style of play be “popular,” appealing. The club regularly hands out free tickets to local children, and it has refitted all of its V. I. P. areas some do not close until the small hours of the morning. There was even an ice rink installed outside the Allianz Riviera before Christmas. It would be unfair to dismiss all of those initiatives as gimmickry, an artificial imposition of a soccer culture. Beneath the surface, the bond between this city and this club is strong. At the start of the Promenade des Anglais, in the heart of the city, is a memorial to the 86 people killed in the Bastille Day terror attack last year. It is an impossibly moving sight: a bandstand awash with thousands of teddy bears left to commemorate the dead, poems written in their honor, flags, stones, candles and messages of condolence. Rival fans have made pilgrimages here, during the season, to pay their respects: a Montpellier pennant, a Lens jersey, a scarf from F. C. Krasnodar, a Russian team, all nestle among the tributes. And everywhere, there are flashes of red and black, OGC Nice’s colors, the team’s identity acting as a surrogate for that of the city. It is a role that Rivère, and the club as a whole, feel keenly. OGC Nice has helped raise hundreds of thousands of euros for the families of the victims. In the 86th minute of every home game, it remembers those who were murdered. It would be glib to say the tragedy has helped inspire Nice’s success this season nobody at the club would make that claim. But they know that such events cannot only put soccer into perspective but, in the aftermath, also lend it a greater significance. This year they have a greater responsibility and, as they write this latest chapter on their fastidiously planned journey, an opportunity for a greater impact, too. “What happened on July 14 wounded every citizen of Nice,” Rivère said. “It gives us even more willingness to succeed. We are like a medicine, for those who love football. The day of the match, the day after, we help people to forget. ”	1

241	WASHINGTON  —   A Democrat on the Federal Election Commission is quitting her term early because of the gridlock that has gripped the panel, offering President Trump an unexpected chance to shape political spending rules. The commissioner, Ann M. Ravel, said during an interview that she would send Mr. Trump her letter of resignation this week. She pointed to a series of deadlocked votes between the panel’s three Democrats and three Republicans that she said left her little hope the group would ever be able to rein in campaign finance abuses. “The ability of the commission to perform its role has deteriorated significantly,” said Ms. Ravel, who has sparred bitterly with the Republican election commissioners during her three years on the panel. She added, “I think I can be more effective on the outside. ” Her departure will probably set off an intense political fight over how a new commissioner should be picked. By tradition, Senate Democrats would be allowed to select the replacement, but, by law, the choice belongs to the president, and Mr. Trump has shown little interest in Washington customs. The outcome could have a major impact on a commission long derided for inaction, even as record amounts of money have poured into campaigns. Spending during last year’s presidential and congressional races exceeded $6. 9 billion, according to data from the Center for Responsive Politics, as “super PACs” and other outside groups spent freely as a result of the Supreme Court’s 2010 Citizens United decision. Mr. Trump can pick a nominee himself so long as he does not choose a registered Republican, said Richard L. Hasen, an election law scholar at the University of California, Irvine. The panel, which already has three Republicans, cannot have more than three members from any political party. Mr. Hasen said he would not be surprised if Mr. Trump made the pick himself, especially because his White House counsel, Donald F. McGahn II, was an election commissioner himself and has pushed fiercely for deregulating campaign finance. “It would be transformative,” Mr. Hasen said, if the president nominated someone more aligned with the panel’s Republican members to push for even further deregulation. Mr. Trump has promised to “drain the swamp” of special interest money in Washington, but his record so far has been mixed. While he claimed repeatedly during the campaign that he was “ ” his run, Mr. Trump and organizations supporting him took in nearly $600 million, and he put in far less than the $100 million of his own money that he had pledged. Since taking office, the president has strengthened some rules on lobbying by former members of the executive branch, but ethics experts have also criticized him for failing to fully disentangle himself from his vast financial interests. Ms. Ravel acknowledged she was concerned that Mr. Trump might seek to name her replacement himself. “But I’m hoping that he will understand the need to appoint people who actually believe in the mission of the agency and will carry out the mandates of the law,” she said, but added, “I don’t know what will happen. ” Her claims that Republican commissioners have been unwilling to rein in obvious violations and abuses have drawn wide attention  —   as well as angry rebukes from those Republicans, who have accused her of grandstanding and of exaggerating the problem. The publicity even earned Ms. Ravel an appearance on “The Daily Show,” where her interviewer suggested the commission had become as irrelevant as male nipples. Ms. Ravel said she would return to California, where she had served as a state regulator in identifying millions of dollars in “dark money” that flooded California elections. She considered leaving the commission last year, she said, but decided to stay through the election after President Barack Obama had asked her to do so. While Ms. Ravel will be leaving only two months shy of the end of her term, commissioners have routinely remained well past the end of their terms because of the difficulty in agreeing on replacements. All the other current members are serving well beyond the end of their terms, with one Democrat, Ellen L. Weintraub, now nearly a decade past her term’s 2007 end date. Ms. Ravel plans to release an analysis her office has prepared on what she says is the worsening gridlock at the commission. The title sums up her feelings: “Dysfunction and Deadlock: The Enforcement Crisis at the Federal Election Commission Reveals the Unlikelihood of Draining the Swamp. ” By her analysis, the rate of deadlocked votes blocking “substantive” enforcement actions against possible campaign violations has reached a new high of 37. 5 percent. And, in such cases, she said, financial penalties against campaigns have dropped significantly over the last decade. But, as with many issues at the election commission, Ms. Ravel and her Republican counterparts are sharply at odds over the panel’s performance. Lee E. Goodman, a Republican commissioner, called her analysis “nonsensical and arbitrary,” saying that deadlocked votes were actually far more unusual. Ms. Ravel has continued to push “the tired meme of dysfunction” simply to make her political case, he said. His own data, he added, indicates that campaigns are complying with finance laws far more than before. Mr. Goodman suggested that “contrary to the spin” from Democrats, “the situation has indeed changed, but for the better. ”	1

265	Sitting at a table, grinding his pinkie into the corner of his mouth and staring at the screen, Dr. Evil announces he is holding the world ransom for $1 million. Having been cryogenically frozen for 30 years, the comic villain created by the actor Mike Myers is shocked when he is told that $1 million isn’t a lot of money in 1997. Trying to regain his composure, he turns to the screen, voice cracking with uncertainty, and says, “O. K. then, we hold the world ransom for $100 billion. ” Twenty years after the movie “Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery” was released, billions of dollars aren’t what they used to be, either. Bill Gates alone is just $10 billion shy of Dr. Evil’s ransom demand, according to a list of the world’s top 10 billionaires compiled by   a financial research firm. Mr. Gates, the Microsoft founder, tops the list at $89. 3 billion, followed by his friend Warren Buffett at $73. 5 billion. The top 10  —   nine from the United States, one from Spain  —   have a combined net worth of $582 billion. While their wealth would certainly be enough to save the world from Dr. Evil, what they do with it in real life is the subject of great interest and debate. That is true now more than ever. Issues around money  —   like wealth inequality and talk of tax cuts for the rich  —   are among the hottest topics of the day. And the richest president in history is sitting in the Oval Office, with billionaires sprinkled throughout his cabinet. To some, today’s billionaires are like Dr. Evil: selfish, rapacious and bent on world domination. To others, billionaires are worthy of respect for having put their names and fortunes behind an array of philanthropic endeavors, many aimed at improving the lives of people at the very base of the wealth pyramid. There were 2, 473 billionaires in the world, as of  ’s last count through 2015. That was a 6. 4 percent increase in billionaires from the year before. But who these billionaires are and what they’re like is more difficult to discern. Many may seem as ordinary as the guy sitting next to you on the train  —   or in Michael Bloomberg’s case, standing beside you on the subway, when he was mayor of New York. (Mr. Bloomberg is No. 9 on  ’s list.) There are certainly billionaires who want to save the world, like Mr. Gates, Mr. Buffett and Mr. Bloomberg, who have pledged to give their fortunes away. Others in the top 10 are also philanthropic, but they are still focusing on their day jobs, like Jeff Bezos of Amazon, Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook and Larry Page of Alphabet (the parent of Google)  —   Nos. 4, 5 and 10. Yet many of the billionaires beyond the top 10 or 20 have a much lower profile. Who outside of finance or hockey knew of Vincent Viola, a former oil trader and current owner of the Florida Panthers, before President Trump nominated him to be secretary of the Army? Now that he has withdrawn, he can return to relative anonymity. For that matter, Wilbur L. Ross, Mr. Trump’s choice for commerce secretary, is the wealthiest of the president’s billionaire cabinet picks. He would pop up in the headlines every few years for a deal he was making but then return to what could be called the quiet opulence of the billionaire class. “We know that things are quite different for a billionaire individual or a billionaire family than they are for even a very wealthy     family,” said Belinda Sneddon, national practice executive in the family office group at U. S. Trust. “They’re different in how they can invest their assets and what their portfolio may look like,” Ms. Sneddon said. “In many ways, they face different risks, both personal risks and cyber risks, than the average individual does. They often think about structuring decisions differently from a   standpoint as well as the structure they create around themselves and their family. ” Yet for most people, billionaires are just wealthy beyond belief. And these days, they are also much wealthier (and getting even more so) than the broader     population. That group is defined as anyone with more than $30 million. In 2015, there were 212, 615 of them. On the lower end, the 155, 050 people worth between $30 million and $99 million had a combined $8. 4 trillion. At the top, the world’s 2, 473 billionaires were worth $7. 68 trillion. “There is growing inequality around the world, but there is also inequality among the ultrawealthy,” said Maya Imberg, director of custom research at  . Billionaires also matter because of the outsize influence they have, or believe they can have, on policy and public life. They can give millions to a political campaign, as Peter Thiel, a founder of PayPal and a director of Facebook, did with Mr. Trump, or as George Soros, the hedge fund manager and philanthropist, has done with liberal causes. They can also give millions to combat disease, as the industrialist Jon Huntsman Sr. has done with cancer, or to start schools in Africa, as Pierre Omidyar, a founder of eBay, has done. But billionaires are as different from one another as members of any other economic group. How they amassed their billions, and how that pile is growing, tells a lot about the economy today. Just as the best teacher in the country is going to earn less money than a mediocre investment banker, the industries in which future billionaires begin their careers determine the magnitude of their wealth and how quickly it is going to grow. Six of the top 10 billionaires made their money in technology. But in  ’s research, technology ranks sixth overall for the number of billionaires on the list, with 114 around the world. Finance has created the most billionaires, with 377, or 15 percent of the world’s billionaires. It is followed by industrial conglomerates, with 317, or 13 percent. After that, the concentration in particular industries drops. Real estate is third with 141. The group of people who identify their industry as nonprofits (meaning they made their money some other way or inherited it) is fourth, with 122. Manufacturing, in fifth place, has 120. “Globalization has been a big trend,” said Benjamin Kinnard, a research analyst at  . “The market is now seven billion people, not just the size of your domestic country. ” He added that finance had a bigger lead in first place several years ago, but it has been losing ground as industries like technology boom. A tougher route to becoming a billionaire is through keeping track of other people’s billions. Accountants have just one person on the list, who was not identified. The railroad sector, a source of so much wealth in the last Gilded Age, has but two billionaires, the same number those in as consumer finance. And while billionaires in the United States are often better known than those elsewhere, there are more billionaires in Europe (though they have less total wealth than their American counterparts). Asia is gaining ground quickly. Research from UBS calculated that a new billionaire is created every three days in Asia, with 65 percent of the region’s billionaires in China. While the number of billionaires in China is rising at a fast clip, the pace of growth in billionaires worldwide is slowing.   said the number will be 3, 250 by 2020, down 16 percent from an earlier prediction of 3, 873. This is because economic growth is expected to slow around the world. Across the billionaire spectrum, the biggest proportion of billionaires’ wealth  —   about half  —   is in the business that created the wealth in the first place, according to  ’s research. After that, they have about a quarter of their money in public securities and a little less than a quarter in cash. Just 4 percent is in real estate and luxury assets, the research found. There are common strains to how they cross the billionaire line, regardless of industry: 57 percent are   according to   and another 31 percent received an inheritance and grew it into billions. “Timing has a lot to do with it,” said John Mathews, head of private wealth management and the     group at UBS. “If we looked back 100 years, it would have been a really great time to be in steel, railroad or infrastructure businesses. Today, it’s a good time to be in technology and finance. ” But there is a difference from the bottom of the billionaire ladder to the top: Most are on that first rung. Over half of all billionaires are worth between $1 billion and $2 billion. Go up to $5 billion and there are 2, 101. And not all billionaires are household names. Ma Jianrong, executive chairman of Shenzhou International Group Holdings, which is the leading textile company in China and manufactures clothing for Nike, Adidas, Puma and Uniqlo, is worth $4. 3 billion. Patrice Motsepe, executive chairman of African Rainbow Minerals, built his wealth through mining in South Africa after starting his career as a lawyer in the United States. He is now worth $2. 1 billion. Kevin Systrom, chief executive of Instagram, is surely well known in Silicon Valley  —   and among students at Stanford University (his alma mater) who want to emulate his route to a net worth of $1. 2 billion by age 33. But he is not as recognizable as Mr. Zuckerberg of Facebook. But being a billionaire, as opposed to a very wealthy millionaire, can make a huge difference in the loss of privacy for a family. “It’s a lot more difficult to be anonymous,” Ms. Sneddon said. And being known as billionaires opens them up to risks, she said, like cybersecurity breaches and attacks on their families. How   billionaires add additional billions isn’t always up to them. One way to become even wealthier is to have picked the right global industry in which to make your billions and hang on to your stake in your company as it booms  —   and avoids busts. Right now, the technology and finance industries are leading the growth. Another way is to make your money in the right region, which is Asia. Then, of course, there are the investment opportunities that only get presented to the wealthiest people, and that only they have the resources to take a chance on. “They can diversify their holdings to protect themselves,” Mr. Kinnard said. And the big investments that are needed in private equity deals, for example, are a smaller portion of overall wealth for billionaires than for someone with, say, $100 million. “The common thread with billionaires is the incredibly focused drive these people have in whatever business they go into,” Mr. Mathews said. “It’s dogged determination. You can say everyone is like that, but with billionaires everything else gets blocked out. You see it today with tech the way you saw it with steel barons 100 years ago. ” Yet getting across the billionaire line does not mean a person will always be there. “Once a billionaire doesn’t mean you’ll stay a billionaire,” Mr. Mathews of UBS said. “Last year alone there were 41 new billionaires created in the United States, but 36 also dropped out of billionaire status in the U. S. Our billionaire population is growing but only by a net of five. ” In the United States, Mr. Mathews said, most people fall off the billionaire list because they sell the company that created their wealth. “When you sell it, there are tax issues,” he said. “There are   issues. ” The latter results in chunks of money being given to heirs to get it out of the wealth creator’s estate. Selling family firms happens less often in Europe and Asia. People end up holding on to them and creating family holding companies to continue to operate that original business and expand into others. Of course, people who sell their $1 billion company and end up with $500 million after taxes  —   or whose wealth tops out at $800 million  —   aren’t scraping by. But being a billionaire gives you entry into an exclusive club that being a millionaire does not. After all, in Mr. Trump’s cabinet, Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson’s wealth from his career at Exxon Mobil looks positively modest. He’s worth just a few hundred million. What is expected of people who have more money than they could spend in several lifetimes? It depends on whom you ask. A recent report from Oxfam International, the antipoverty charity, argued that eight billionaires had as much wealth as half of the world’s population  —   or 3. 6 billion people  —   and that that was a travesty. “It is obscene for so much wealth to be held in the hands of so few when one in 10 people survive on less than $2 a day,” Winnie Byanyima, executive director of Oxfam, said in a statement. “Inequality is trapping hundreds of millions in poverty. It is fracturing our societies and undermining democracy. ” Yet the anger against the superrich has abated since the Occupy Wall Street protests in 2011. Protesters seem to be more concerned with the actions of Mr. Trump (who is likely a billionaire, although he has provided little proof of his real wealth) than with his cabinet of plutocrats. One of his tax proposals would keep billionaires from having to part with more of their wealth, by eliminating the estate tax. Without it, generational wealth would be easier to preserve and perpetuate. Philanthropy has become important to many billionaires, and not just through the Giving Pledge, Mr. Buffett’s compact to get the wealthiest to give away at least half of their fortunes. Nor is it confined to the United States, with its tradition of charitable giving. “You’re starting to see where philanthropy is becoming more and more important to billionaires regardless of where they live,” Mr. Mathews said. “I don’t know if 10, 12 years ago, it was much of a conversation in Asia. Now all billionaires, regardless of where they live, are worried about the next generation. ” But there are limits to what even a billionaire can do. Mr. Bloomberg, in an interview in 2014, recalled the time he was approached at a conference in Sun Valley, Idaho, by a hedge fund manager offering him $1 billion over five years to change public education in New York. “When I explained to him that New York City’s annual school budget was $22 billion a year,” Mr. Bloomberg said, “that was the last time we ever heard from him. ”	1
143	(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the  .) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. President Trump said he could “live with” a   solution to the   conflict, backing away from a   of American policy in the Middle East. The remarks, delivered at a news conference with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, spurred anger and bafflement among Palestinians, some of whom said the policy change would undercut the already slim chances of progress toward reconciliation. “This is going to give Israel a free hand to do what it wants,” said one man in Gaza City. _____ 2. Russia denied a New York Times report that senior Russian intelligence officials had repeated contact with Trump campaign staff members in the year before the U. S. election. But the resignation of Michael T. Flynn as national security adviser underscores lingering uncertainty about the relationship between the Trump administration and Russia. Seeking to shift the narrative, Mr. Trump focused on the leaks from American intelligence agencies to the news media. “Very  !” he wrote on Twitter. Today’s episode of The Daily podcast reviews what is known about Mr. Flynn’s contacts with Russia. Listen from a computer, an iOS device or an Android device. _____ 3. Andrew Puzder, Mr. Trump’s nominee for labor secretary, withdrew from consideration after growing Republican doubts that he could be confirmed. It was a rare moment of cheer for Democrats, who had hammered Mr. Puzder  —   the chief executive of the CKE Restaurants   chain, which owns Hardee’s and Carl’s Jr.  —   for his treatment of workers and opposition to the minimum wage. His personal life had also been scrutinized. Senators had been shown a tape of his   incognito on Oprah Winfrey’s television show in 1990, detailing her claims of abuse against him, which she later recanted. _____ 4. Our reporters are tracking the case of Jeanette Vizguerra, a mother of three who has lived in the U. S. for 20 years. She had to make a harrowing choice: check in with the immigration authorities, risking deportation and separation from her children, or bunker down inside a church for what could be months or years. U. S. citizens are also feeling pressures, as activists report an increase in requests by border agents to examine travelers’ digital devices. Here’s a guide to your rights if an agent asks you to unlock your phone. _____ 5. Throughout the country, independent bookstores have taken on a new life as centers of resistance to the Trump administration. Besides hawking George Orwell’s “1984,” they are handing out lawmakers’ contact information and hosting events to gather protesters. There are also some defections from the opposing camp. The @Trump_Regrets Twitter account has amplified the second thoughts of people who once supported the Republican president. “I voted for you but you’re still acting like a baby,” one wrote. _____ 6. The police in Malaysia detained a woman holding Vietnamese travel documents and were looking for other suspects in what appears to have been a lethal poison attack on the half brother of North Korea’s leader, Kim   at the Kuala Lumpur airport. The brother, Kim   had pleaded for his life in a letter to the leader in 2012, but a South Korean official said there had been “a standing order” for his assassination since Kim   took power in 2011. Researchers say Mr. Kim has ordered more than 300 executions. _____ 7. For the second straight year, traffic deaths were up in the United States. Fatalities increased 6 percent to 40, 200 in 2016, according to preliminary estimates from the nonprofit National Safety Council. If the estimates are confirmed, it would be the deadliest year since 2007. There’s no single cause for the increase, but activists have pointed to more lenient enforcement of traffic safety laws and increasing numbers of distracted drivers. _____ 8. “When all eyes were on her, she didn’t decide to make herself more palatable to white viewers. Instead, she let her imagination serve her goals, her child and her community. ” That’s from one of our most popular pieces today, an essay on what Beyoncé won at the Grammys, even as she lost out on Best Album to Adele. “Black people who do transgressive or radical work must redefine and reimagine what winning is in a white supremacist capitalist culture,” the author, the   writer Myles E. Johnson, argues. _____ 9. It’s never been more appropriate to say “Bon appétit. ” Our food editors bring you a   cookbook by Melissa Clark on the new essentials of French cooking, filled with    video instructions, historical background and practical tips and techniques. She’ll help you master 10 classic dishes, from a morning omelet to an evening soufflé. _____ 10. Finally, in the category of strange world history: As Europe teetered on the brink of World War II, Winston Churchill was preoccupied with the question of whether we are alone in the universe. In a newly discovered 1939 essay, he argued that humans aren’t all that special: “I, for one, am not so immensely impressed by the success we are making of our civilization here that I am prepared to think we are the only spot in this immense universe which contains living, thinking creatures. ” Have an excellent night, and as “The  ” would say: The truth is out there. _____ Photographs may appear out of order for some readers.

814	 However, in an exclusive interview with Newslo, Kim Davis said that “the only thing worse for me than being jailed is being jailed in an all-women correctional facility.” Davis spoke to Newslo and expressed her concerns over the state’s plans to move her to a female prison if she does not comply with the ruling within a limited time frame.“It’s total injustice,” Davis said. “They are trying to break me, to get me to bow down to them and do what they want. But that’s not gonna happen, I will stand strong because God ordained me to do so. They took me away from my husband and now they’re preparing to strike the final blow because they know how much I hate LGBT people.

825	 State Of Florida Passes Law Which Makes Nudity Legal At All Public Beaches http://t.co/8o31E2KLw1— Eddie Crowe (@OccupationBlues) August 26, 2015 So if you have a Florida state nudity license you're now aloud to be nude at any public beach. Lmfao I'm so done— Kendall Faulk (@_kendallfaulk) August 26, 2015 @juliannanicol33 I mean could be a lie.. But still lol pic.twitter.com/DaerOxQt6n— Kendall Faulk (@_kendallfaulk) August 26, 2015  The state of Florida has made a bold change to its laws concerning nudity at public beaches, and this one might ruffle some feathers. Beginning August 1st, full nudity will be legal at all public beaches – as long as you obtain a Florida State Nudity License (FSNL).Governor Rick Scott approved the bill passed by the state legislature making public nudity at state-owned beaches legal, and he encourages tourists and residents to make use of new law. “Today is a great day. Not only will it be legal to hang out at the beach totally nude, but we encourage you do to so,” Governor Scott said. “As long as you are a fairly attractive person, nobody is going to complain.” Empire News is intended for entertainment purposes only.

428	President Trump addressed a joint session of Congress for the first time. Here’s how we analyzed it in real time, and our live fact checks. The State of the Union is   …     not happening this year, technically. But in a   address to a joint session of Congress on Tuesday, President Trump was expected to deliver the equivalent: a speech intended to set the course for his   policy agenda and mollify concerns on Capitol Hill after his uneven first month in office. ■ The president tries to set the tone in an   interview on “Fox and Friends. ” He gives himself a grade of A so far. ■ Representative Eliot L. Engel, Democrat of New York, said he would break a nearly   streak and not try to greet the president, citing policy differences. Here is what to keep an eye on: President Trump suggested on Tuesday that the recent spate of   bomb threats and cemetery vandalism could be politically coordinated attacks to “make people look bad”  —   an apparent suggestion that his opponents could be behind them. Speaking at the White House to attorneys general from around the country, Mr. Trump was asked by Josh Shapiro, the attorney general of Pennsylvania, about the wave of attacks and how the federal government could work with state governments to confront the violence. “First, he said the acts were reprehensible,” Mr. Shapiro, a Democrat who was elected to the post in November, said while recounting Mr. Trump’s response. “Second he said: ‘And you’ve got to be careful, it could be the reverse. This could be the reverse, trying to make people look bad.’ ” The comments echoed the Twitter post of an adviser, Anthony Scaramucci, who suggested that Democrats were behind threats to Jewish community centers. During the presidential campaign, Mr. Trump was questioned for his seemingly reluctant denunciation of David Duke, the former Klansman who backed him, and for the onslaught of   hate from supporters on social media. At a news conference this month, Mr. Trump suggested that people who were holding up   signs at rallies were doing so to make him look bad. “Some of it is written by our opponents,” Mr. Trump said at the time. “You do know that. Do you understand that?” Approximately 100 tombstones were toppled at a Jewish cemetery in Philadelphia this week, the second such attack in the city in the last month. Synagogues, community centers and cemeteries around the country have been targeted this year. Democrats condemned Mr. Trump’s remarks on Tuesday and called for an apology. “For millennia, Jews have not only endured unthinkable violence, but the subsequent denial of that violence,” said Eric Walker, a spokesman for the Democratic National Committee. “For the president of the United States to insinuate that threats to Jewish community centers are illegitimate is truly beyond the pale. ” The   League, which combats   said it was “astonished” by Mr. Trump’s sentiments and called on him to clarify his remarks. Mr. Shapiro, speaking on the sidelines of the attorneys general conference, said that he was not entirely sure of what to make of Mr. Trump’s comments. “I was a little surprised by it, and others were, too, Republicans and Democrats,” Mr. Shapiro said. “The question I asked was a genuine one and one of great concern to people in my state. ” Mr. Trump told the attorneys general that he planned to discuss the issue during his address to Congress on Tuesday night. Mr. Trump gave his presidency an A so far in an interview broadcast Tuesday morning, but he added that he would only give himself a C for communicating how great he has been. Appearing on “Fox and Friends,” which he has called one of his favorite shows, Mr. Trump blamed former President Barack Obama for organizing opposition against him, called Representative Nancy Pelosi, the House Democratic leader, “incompetent” and gently criticized his own press secretary for how he has handled leaks. The interview, shown just hours before Mr. Trump was to deliver his first address to a joint session of Congress, set the stage for a day when he will have perhaps the biggest audience available to him for the rest of his first year in office. He highlighted his plans to increase military spending, tighten borders and replace Mr. Obama’s health care program, and he boasted that he had already brought back jobs to America. “I think I’ve done great things, but I don’t think I have  —   I and my people  —   I don’t think we’ve explained it well enough to the American public,” he said. “I think I get an A in terms of what I’ve actually done, but in terms of messaging, I’d give myself a C or a  . ” He acknowledged that he did not have the support of a majority of Americans in polls, but he said those who do back him were more intense. “The love is great,” he said. “And I saw a poll where I was at 45 or 46 percent, but one of the things they said is that the level of enthusiasm for me is as strong as they’ve ever seen. ” Mr. Trump rejected criticism by Ms. Pelosi, who said that for all the sound and fury, the president had not actually accomplished much in his first month in office. “I’ve been watching Nancy’s tape, and so I think she’s incompetent, actually,” Mr. Trump said. Asked by the Fox hosts if he thought Mr. Obama was responsible for some of the protests against his policies, Mr. Trump agreed but brushed it off. “I think he is behind it,” he said. “I also think it’s politics,” adding, “And look, I have a very thick skin. ” Mr. Trump, who has railed against leaks, said some of them had probably come from holdovers from the Obama administration. But he said his press secretary, Sean Spicer, was wrong to have brought a group of staff members into his office and inspect their cellphones in the presence of White House lawyers. “Sean Spicer is a fine human being he’s a fine person,” Mr. Trump said. “I would have done it differently. I would have gone    with different people. ” He added: “I would have handled it differently than Sean. But Sean handles it his way, and I’m O. K. with it. ” For almost three decades, Representative Eliot L. Engel, a New York Democrat, has stood along the aisle of the House chamber for every presidential address to Congress, waiting to shake the president’s hand. But on Tuesday evening, Mr. Trump will become the first president since 1989 to not receive a greeting from Mr. Engel. As curious reporters mused whether Mr. Engel would repeat his annual ritual of claiming his seat long before the address begins, the lawmaker bypassed the prime empty aisle seat and a chance to shake hands with his fellow New Yorker. Among other disagreements that factored into his decision to skip the handshake, Mr. Engel said, were Mr. Trump’s unwillingness to investigate Russian meddling in the 2016 election and his attacks on the news media. “The president needs to work with all people,” Mr. Engel said. “And therefore I will listen to what he has to say today, but I will not greet him and shake his hand. ” Mr. Engel, the top Democrat on the Foreign Affairs Committee, has been among Mr. Trump’s most vocal critics in the House, pressing for further investigations into the administration’s ties to Russia. In January Mr. Engel introduced legislation that would punish any foreign entity found to have intervened in a federal election. Some Democrats planned to make a statement with their wardrobe as well: A group of female members planned to wear white, the color of the suffragist movement, in a signal to Mr. Trump on women’s rights. Representative Lois Frankel of Florida, the chairwoman of the Democratic Women’s Working Group, said on Twitter that the choice of attire symbolized “a pledge to protect women’s health, fair pay, paid leave  more!” Based on the preview that his attorney general, Jeff Sessions, gave reporters on Monday, Mr. Trump is expected to hark back to his “law and order” theme by promising more aggressive federal policing of gun crimes, drugs and other areas in response to a rise in violent crime in some big cities. Crime is near historic lows nationwide and remains far below levels seen in the 1970s and ‘80s. But Mr. Sessions, a former senator and prosecutor who was an important campaign adviser to Mr. Trump, told reporters he was worried that the increase in violence in some major cities, like Chicago and Baltimore, was “not a blip” and could signal “a   trend. ” Mr. Sessions gave speech of his own on that topic Tuesday morning to the National Association of Attorneys General in Washington. Mr. Sessions said he wanted to let local police officers know “that they’re being supported” in Washington, and he suggested that morale was lagging in some departments because of a lack of federal leadership. Mr. Trump will also be trying to affirm his role as commander in chief. In the Fox interview, Mr. Trump described a raid in Yemen that left an American commando and a number of civilians dead as something that generals “wanted to do” and that was planned before he took office, drawing charges that he was deflecting responsibility for a mission he approved. Mr. Trump was asked to respond to William Owens, father of Chief Petty Officer William Owens, 36, the Navy SEAL member who was killed in the Jan. 29 raid. Mr. Owens told The Miami Herald that he refused to meet with the president when his son’s body was returned home, and asked why the new administration had rushed into a “stupid mission. ” “Well, this was a mission that was started before I got here,” Mr. Trump said. “This was something that was, you know, just, they wanted to do. They came to see me, they explained what they wanted to do, the generals. ” Moments later, he reiterated that “this was something that they were looking at for a long time doing. ” His statement drew sharp responses from critics who said he was defying a long tradition of commanders shouldering responsibility for what happens under them. “He’s the opposite of a `buck stops here’ president,” said Douglas Brinkley, a presidential historian at Rice University. “Trump has a predilection for always blaming somebody else for what goes wrong. ” Andrew Exum, a former Army Ranger who served as a deputy assistant secretary of defense in the Obama administration, wrote on Twitter that in the Trump worldview, “Trump is responsible for all the victories, his team for all the defeats. ” Though he spoke of the Yemen mission not as his own, but as a project of “the generals,” Mr. Trump boasted, “My generals are the most respected that we’ve had in many decades, I believe. ” In fact, the military command consists almost entirely of people who were in their posts before he took office. Muslims. Immigrants. A recent detainee. Officially, the Democratic rebuttal to Mr. Trump’s speech will come from Steven L. Beshear, the former governor of Kentucky, who will defend the Affordable Care Act. But inside the House chamber where Mr. Trump will speak, Democrats plan to assemble a cadre of human symbols, bringing as guests several people imperiled by the president’s policies. Eschewing   boycotts of the speech  —   a feature of Mr. Trump’s inaugural address  —   members of Congress have used their invitations as another form of protest. Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts is bringing an Iraqi refugee who settled in the state in 2010 and is now an American citizen. Representative Nydia M. Velázquez of New York invited Hameed Khalid Darweesh, who worked as a translator for American forces in Iraq and was detained last month at Kennedy International Airport under the Trump administration’s travel ban. Other guests include undocumented immigrants who were protected from deportation under Mr. Obama, an Iranian graduate student and the founder of the Syrian Community Network.	1

222	TUNIS  —   Dressed in a thick jacket and wool hat on a cool winter evening, counting the coins for his bus fare, Hedi Hammami looks like any other Tunisian on his way to work. But he walks with a limp and sometimes pauses midspeech and screws up his face in pain. “That’s Guantánamo,” he explains. After eight years as a detainee in the United States detention facility in Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, he says he still suffers from headaches, depression and anxiety attacks from the torture and other mistreatment he says he suffered there, even six years after his release. Married with two children now and employed as a nighttime ambulance driver, Mr. Hammami, 47, seems to have rebuilt his life. Yet the pressures of living in Tunisia’s faltering democracy, under harassment and enduring repeated raids by the police, have driven him to make an extreme request. “It would be better for me to go back to that single cell and to be left alone,” he said recently. “Two or three weeks ago I went to the Red Cross and asked them to connect me to the U. S. foreign ministry to ask to go back to Guantánamo. ” The Red Cross refused to take his request, he said, but he insists nevertheless that at this point, that would be best for him. “I have lost my hope,” he says. “There is no future in this country for me. ” When he was first released from Guantánamo in 2010, Tunisia was still a dictatorship under the rule of President Zine   Ben Ali and notorious for torturing prisoners, in particular Islamists. Deemed no longer a threat to the United States, Mr. Hammami was sent to the former Soviet republic of Georgia. After the popular uprising in 2011 that overthrew Mr. Ben Ali and set off the Arab Spring, Mr. Hammami negotiated his return to Tunisia. He timed it well, benefiting from a national amnesty for political prisoners and a program of compensation that gave him a job in the Ministry of Health. “I hoped very much that after the revolution everything would get better,” he said in one of several interviews in his rented home in a   suburb of Tunis. Yet, soon after he began work in 2013, the police raided his apartment with dogs at 3 a. m. breaking the door and hauling him down to the police station. “They made me crawl on all fours down the stairs,” he recounted. At the police station they said they just wanted to get to know him, and let him go after 15 minutes. “That was just the beginning. ” Since then, Mr. Hammami has lived under a constant regimen of police surveillance, raids and harassment. His cellphone and computer were confiscated. When he moved to a new house, the police followed him, turning up at all hours to question him. In December 2015 he was placed under house arrest, told he no longer had the right to work and ordered to sign in at the police station morning and evening for six weeks. He remains under “administrative control,” and the police enforce the order at will. He cannot travel outside Tunis. Every so often, like on Sept. 11, the police order him to sign in with them. “I feel someone is doing it for revenge,” he says. The police have also scared landlords from renting to him, forcing him to move six times in three years. His Algerian wife’s residency card was confiscated, preventing her from working to supplement his meager salary. The family is barely managing, she said, asking not to be named for fear of further police harassment. Stress and tension from the police actions have intensified the psychological problems Mr. Hammami brought with him from Guantánamo. “I feel too much pressure,” he said, rubbing his temples. “All that blackness comes back. ” Rim Ben Ismail, a psychologist working for the World Organization Against Torture in Tunisia, who has counseled 12 Tunisians who were detained in Guantánamo, says Mr. Hammadi’s wish to return to his cell is fairly typical of the Guantánamo detainees. “They lived with suffering, physical suffering,” she said in an interview. “But now there is a psychic suffering, and often they say, ‘Take me back there. ’” “Because of their past they are all presumed guilty and it is unlivable for all of them and their families,” she added. “The families are being threatened and harassed. ” Parents in particular fear the Tunisian security forces and say they think their sons would be safer in Guantánamo, she added. Raids have often been needlessly violent, she said police officials break down doors and wake a suspect with a gun to his head, often in front of his wife and children. “Everything is being done to create aggression in a person,” she said. “They do not need to raid the house at 2 a. m. ” One of her former Guantánamo patients was harassed so relentlessly by police that he became suicidal and ran off to Syria, where he was killed. “He was such a gentle person,” she said sadly. “By treating these people like this you create a climate of revenge and the sense that they have no place at home. ” There is no doubt that Tunisia has a terrorism problem. It has been grappling with attacks from Al   groups since 2013. The violence escalated to spectacular attacks in 2015 and 2016 that killed more than 70 people, many of them foreign tourists at a national museum and at a beach resort hotel. Moreover, Tunisians reportedly make up the largest number of foreign fighters to have joined the Islamic State and other extremist groups in Syria and Iraq, and some have been encouraged to conduct attacks when they return home. After an attack killed 12 members of the presidential guard in November 2015, the government imposed a state of emergency. At least 139 Tunisians have been placed under house arrest since, according to Human Rights Watch, which documented the cases in a report released in September. The sanctions have been justified in the context of countering terrorism but have “left people facing stigmatization and unable to pursue studies and work,” it stated. International human rights officials have voiced growing concerns of abuses resurfacing in Tunisia. In a report released this week, Amnesty International accused the Tunisian police and security forces of employing repressive measures used by past dictatorships, including torture, deaths in custody, arbitrary house raids and often unlawful harassment of suspects, their families and communities. Ben Emmerson, the United Nations special rapporteur for human rights while countering terrorism, said during a recent visit to Tunisia that human rights should be central to counterterrorism operations, noting that torture and other repressive measures fuel radicalism. Mr. Hammami says he feels the police are pushing him that way. The son of a farmer from Tunisia’s poor northwest, he says he originally left for Italy in 1986 in search of work. There he fell in with an Islamic missionary group, Tablighi Jamaat, and later traveled to Pakistan, where he obtained refugee status. He was arrested in Pakistan and handed over to the American military in 2002 and transferred to Guantánamo, where he was accused of training in Qaeda camps in Afghanistan. The Americans also say they found his identification papers in Tora Bora, the last redoubt of Osama bin Laden in the country, according to papers released by WikiLeaks. Mr. Hammami, who denies going to Afghanistan or having any links to Qaeda or terrorism, was eventually released without charge. Whatever his past, he says after nearly 20 years away, he just wants to live quietly. “I never committed a crime,” he said. “I don’t have a record, no theft, no ethics problems, nothing. ” “My only demand is to be stable, but they don’t let me live my life in stability,” he said. “They are pushing you towards death. ”	1
106	So much   over such a simple proposition: When a financial professional gives you advice about the life savings in your retirement account, that person ought to act in your best interest. It took several years for this   fiduciary rule to gain approval  —   firms are supposed to begin following the new rules in April  —   thanks to pushback from people in the financial services industry. And then, in the course of a week, we’ve seen President Trump tell the Labor Department to study this uncontroversial (and already  ) proposition, which he wants to upend. A few days later came a big loss for industry players who challenged the legitimacy of the rule in Texas, where a federal judge ruled against them. But let’s put the focus back where it belongs: not on politics or the law, but on you. The best way to understand what the fiduciary debate is about  —   and to protect yourself  —   is to view this discussion through the lens of fees. Every time you do business with people in the financial services industry, ask them this: How much money are you making, and what are the different ways you are making it? If only there were a simple answer to this question all of the time. All of this fiduciary wrangling got started in large part because there has rarely been a simple answer in many parts of the industry. “The fiduciary rule ultimately comes down to the fact that some people are making a lot of money at the expense of other people who have no idea how much their adviser is getting paid,” said Lynn M. Dunston, who runs a financial planning firm in Denver, where the only fees he earns come directly from clients. The best (and by far, the funniest) explanation I’ve seen of what a fiduciary is and does comes from a video that a firm called HighTower Advisors posted on YouTube in 2012. There, they compare butchers and nutritionists. Butchers push meat, perhaps the best meat they have. Nutritionists, however, tell you what is best to eat, period, because they have your best overall health interests at heart and have no stake in how much meat you consume. When seeking advice on your life savings, presumably you would want to speak to the nutritionists and not the butchers. But the butchers of the financial world are in a pretty good spot right now. After all, we have just seen eight years of stock market gains. With an unpredictable new president in the White House, people have reason to be wary. So enter the annuity peddlers, and others touting safety, protections from downside risk, guarantees and the possibility of participating in future market gains, too. And wouldn’t you know it? The way these salespeople sold those products during the last downturn was a big part of what pushed the proponents of the fiduciary rule to act. You will be seeing these pitches soon enough, and when you do, there is a long list of questions you must ask. In fact, anytime anyone is trying to sell you an actively managed mutual fund, a real estate investment trust, or REIT, that you don’t understand or anything else even remotely confusing, hit them with each and every one of the following questions: How much money will you personally make in cash commission, now, if I select this product? And how much will you make later, in any sort of ongoing or trailing commission? Is there a bonus you are eligible for that comes as a result of your recruitment to this firm? Is it in jeopardy if you don’t make this sale? Are you earning more from selling me this product than you might from putting me in a similar product from a different company? Are you earning more than you might if you put me in a different vehicle from the same company? Is your company or the company that created this product running any contests that might lead to you getting to take a free trip if I buy this product? (For a fun virtual tour of the places your salesperson might go, see the two reports that Senator Elizabeth Warren has put out in the last couple of years.) And while we are discussing trips, do any of the companies that you work with offer “due diligence” trips? You know, the ones where you spend an hour learning about the products and 10 hours drinking and golfing? “My wife reads on Facebook that one of our mutual friends is down in Orlando at a fixed annuities conference,” said Patrick Rush, who sold annuities in a former life and is now a financial planner in Greensboro, N. C. “She’s like, ‘What is going on? How come you don’t win anything?’ ” Now, what about other forms of payment, say in points that you might redeem for merchandise? Mr. Dunston of Denver once sold annuities before he came upon what he describes as a better way to help clients (and his blog post on the journey is well worth a read). After a couple of big sales more than a decade ago, he had earned enough credits to exchange them for a diamond ring for his wife worth about $3, 500. The annuity provider, Allianz, told me that a thorough search of its records did not yield information that confirmed Mr. Dunston’s story, but Mr. Dunston said that it may have been a third party that ran the incentive program, and that he is certain he earned those points and that spiffy ring through Allianz. “You can see why advisers might be conflicted about offering something like this versus a   index fund,” he said. “But I really thought I was doing the right thing at the time. ” More questions! Do you get to eat lots of free food? Mr. Rush, the Greensboro planner, well remembers all of the     seminars he once attended at Ruth’s Chris, the steak house chain, courtesy of various financial services companies. How about hoops tickets in   parts of the country? “There were certainly people who could provide Carolina or Duke seats,” he said. “You knew who to call. They weren’t going to be putting you up in the nosebleed seats either. ” Then, there is some  . You will be offered all sorts of product features and extras, and you will need to ask the following questions: How much extra will I pay in fees (or how much might I sacrifice in returns or payouts) if I elect to receive a   bonus on my annuity? Or for a guaranteed minimum income or benefit if I elect to take my money in monthly payments starting at some later date? What if I want a death benefit for my heirs? Are there specific charges for the insurance component of the product? Are there any penalties for pulling my money out early? As for any subaccounts in my annuity, are there expense ratios or fees for the money there? A separate management fee? Trading fees? A   or other administrative fee? Please provide me an itemized list for any and all fees, thank you! Finally, does your firm stand to collect any fees that you yourself will not share in as part of your commission because they have favored one product or another or limited their platform to certain products and locked out others? There is no right answer to these questions, not exactly anyway. Some annuities can be useful (especially the simple fixed, immediate ones and similar products known as longevity insurance) and in some other cases you may get what you pay for in peace of mind. But many other annuities may cost 3. 5 percent annually when you add up all of the fees. For about   of that or even less in some cases, you can find a fiduciary adviser who will give you     advice on every aspect of your financial life and put you in solid (if boring, and simple) investments that cost a tiny fraction of what many annuities do. It’s anyone’s guess how much regulators will ultimately be looking out for you. All Jillian B. Rogers, a Labor Department spokeswoman, would say was that it is exploring options to delay the applicability date for the fiduciary rule. And she would not explain on the record why the department removed an explainer on the rule from its website recently, though an archived version is pretty easy to find. Whatever happens, however, so much will hinge on squishy terms like suitability, best interests, the reasonableness of fees, legal exceptions to any and all standards and whoever is adjudicating any disputes. Rather than get caught up in all of that, it’s probably best to protect yourself from the outset. And in an industry that makes a game of hiding lots and lots of fees every which way, the best possible response is to ask lots and lots of questions.	1
450	Francis Henry Taylor, a director of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in the 1940s and ’50s, described the museum as no less than “the midwife of democracy. ” But officials at the Minneapolis Institute of Art, that city’s grand encyclopedic museum, probably didn’t bargain on a version of democracy as messy as the one they got on Saturday, when a protest turned violent and made its way into the galleries, with fists and feet flying near artworks. The confrontation began when a large group of organized protesters, holding banners identifying themselves as the Industrial Workers of the World, held a rally in front of the museum. Kaywin Feldman, the museum’s director, said security camera footage showed two or three men apparently engaging in an argument with the protesters. When the men went into the museum, I. W. W. protesters followed them inside. A Minneapolis group that describes itself as part of the   movement said Tuesday that its members were the ones followed inside and attacked. The group  —   which declined to name the members, citing safety concerns  —   posted a statement online about the incident. “We were there only to meet a few new faces and enjoy the Minneapolis Institute of Art’s beautiful collection,” the group, Alt Right MN, stated. “However, when we got there, the IWW protesters were waiting. We had no idea that it had anything to do with us until two of our members were attacked upstairs, simply for how they looked. ” Also on Tuesday, a group called the Twin Cities General Defense Committee of the I. W. W. posted its own account of the incident online, saying that it had shown up at the museum to disrupt plans for what it called a fascist,   rally. Two witnesses told The Star Tribune of Minneapolis that they had heard the   men yelling   provocations, and that one of the men was wearing a   or   symbol on his jacket. Attempts to reach the witnesses by phone and social media on Monday were unsuccessful. But Ms. Feldman said no such symbols were visible in the security footage, and she did not have any information from the museum’s security guards about what the men had been yelling. “We don’t have an indication of who they were,” she said. “But it was obvious that the I. W. W. fellows were going through the galleries looking for them, for their opponents. ” They finally found them in a gallery of   art with two English landscape paintings, French armchairs and a Sèvres porcelain sculpture. A scuffle ensued in which an I. W. W. protester pinned one of the men to the ground and began hitting him. A female museum security guard intervened to protect the man. “She was terribly brave,” Ms. Feldman said. “As you can imagine, our security officers are trained not to put themselves in harm’s way ever. And so this was just a reaction on her part to protect another human. ” The fight was broken up before the police arrived, and no art was damaged, Ms. Feldman said. She added that the man who was hit declined to press charges. No one was arrested. “We’re a free museum, and making the institution accessible is the value we hold most dear,” Ms. Feldman said. “We will always maintain that, and we have no intention to profile visitors. But with this in mind, we will now look carefully for indicators of people we might need to keep an eye out for. ”	1

What many teenagers these days are considering a harmless prank, has landed one online gamer in more trouble than he could have ever imagined. In a Louisiana courtroom today, 15-year-old Paul Horner broke down in tears after a judge found the young man guilty on two counts of domestic terrorism and was sentenced to twenty-five years to life in federal prison.Horner is the first person in history to be charged with what is known as “‘swatting,” a growing trend in which a person anonymously files a false police report, such as a murder or bomb threat, in hopes of provoking the police to raid an individual’s home or business. Prosecutors in the case proved that Horner called in multiple false threats against rival online gamers, resulting in SWAT team raids of their residence.

17	Two hundred thousand Uber users deleted the app from their phones after the company supported its New York drivers’ making trips out of Kennedy Airport while taxi companies refused to drive in protest of the Trump administration’s travel ban. From some, it was a moment to switch to rival companies like Lyft, which recently pledged a million dollars to the American Civil Liberties Union. But what does switching from one Silicon Valley corporation to another really accomplish? Aren’t they all basically the same? “If you’re going to ban Uber, throw your iPhone in the trash, delete your Facebook account, stop using Twitter,” Jenna says on this week’s episode of Still Processing. “All of these companies are, in some way, supporting this administration. ” As Wesley puts it: “It’s a protest   . ” Also, with the final season of “Girls” beginning on Sunday night on HBO, we take a moment to talk about the show’s legacy.

289	When it comes to taking lecture notes, Laura Gayle, a sophomore at Florida State University, has her methods. A smiley face connotes an important person. If the professor says, “Make sure you know this,” she uses an asterisk. A triangular button signals a video clip played in class. Later, she will organize the notes, write a video summary and check uncertainties against the textbook or with the professor. For “Introduction to Classical Mythology,” she’ll even alphabetize a list of Greek gods and goddesses. Then, a few days before the exam, she puts it all up for sale. Since last fall, when she uploaded her macroeconomics notes onto Flashnotes. com to pay for a birthday gift for her mother, Ms. Gayle has sold more than 500 copies of the study guides that she’s put together for her courses, made over $3, 285 and tapped into a growing, if controversial, online marketplace. In describing her approach, Ms. Gayle, a human resources major with a 3. 8   average, sounds aggressive in the best way. “I sit in the front row center for every single class, whether I am selling notes or not,” she says. “For me it is a matter of paying attention, being   and,” if something is unclear, “taking the initiative to go out and find the answer. ” Her study guides are rated five stars by users. While borrowing, bartering and selling class notes is nothing new, the online market is just getting organized.   sites matching note sellers and buyers have come and gone in recent years as students who started them graduate. NerdyNotes at Stony Brook University is surviving the graduation of a founder, but bigger players are arriving. Flashnotes started up last fall on five campuses  —   Kent State, Ohio State, Florida State, Rutgers and University of Maryland  —   with 30, 000 registered users. There are now about 100, 000 at 100 campuses, and the company just bought   a Florida State  . The sites let student sellers set prices for notes (average is $9) but take a cut. Flashnotes gets 30 percent NerdyNotes takes 50. The marketplace has annoyed some professors, who bar their students from buying or selling notes. In 2010, California State University banned students on its 23 campuses from using NoteUtopia. com (since bought by Flashnotes) citing a   state education code prohibiting the selling of class notes for commercial purposes. Some argue that lectures are professors’ intellectual property, including notes recording their ideas others warn that notes are a student’s interpretation of a class. Some say that selling them promotes laziness by enticing students to skip lectures. Still others encourage it. “I want them to use any resource they can to do well on my tests,” says Lora Holcombe, an economics professor at Florida State. “It’s not like with the notes you sleep on them and they’ll go into your head. You have to do some heavy studying. ” Michael Matousek, who graduated from Kent State in 2010, dreamed up Flashnotes during a statistics class in his senior year. He had switched majors twice so was taking a required class that covered topics he had previously studied. Students found the professor confusing, but Mr. Matousek “knew how they were confused. ” After classmates repeatedly sought his help, he compiled and sold his notes to a friend. Soon others wanted copies, so Mr. Matousek collected $10 for each emailed copy, netting more than $1, 000 for the semester. The experience showed him the power of peer education  —   and not necessarily led by brainiacs. “The 4. 0 kids, they can’t explain,” he says. “The 3. 5, the 3. 6 kids understand what it takes to learn something. ” Mr. Matousek graduated with a 3. 67 G. P. A. and now heads a staff of 22 at Flashnotes headquarters in Faneuil Hall in Boston. The demand is not surprising. “Students are notoriously poor ” says Kenneth Kiewra, professor of educational psychology at the University of Nebraska, Lincoln. They tend to record only a third of the important lecture points. What makes notes great? “Completeness,” Dr. Kiewra says. Research shows that having detailed, comprehensive notes raises test performance. In his   1985 study, published in Human Learning, Dr. Kiewra randomly assigned 100 students to one of seven groups.   hours after a lecture, the groups had 25 minutes to review before a test. Each group was assigned a learning method: Take your own notes and review (1) your notes, (2) your notes as well as instructor notes, (3) without any notes. Don’t take notes but review (1) instructor notes, (2) without any notes. Skip the lecture but review (1) instructor notes, (2) without any notes. Groups that reviewed instructor notes performed best. “It didn’t matter so much what you did during the lecture,” Dr. Kiewra explains. “It mattered what notes you had. ” Even those who didn’t attend the lecture but reviewed instructor notes did better than those who attended and “reviewed their own crummy notes. ” He concludes: “The real value of   is not so much in the taking as in the having. ” Getting down details along with main points is easier said than done. Average lecture speed is 100 to 125 words a minute, but college students listening to a lecture write 22 words a minute by hand they type just 33 words a minute. In his latest research Dr. Kiewra has found that when the professor pauses three times to let students catch up and fill in missing information, they have more “original, additional and total notes” than those who waited to revise immediately after a lecture. If a student fails to note a particular point, Dr. Kiewra says, there is only a 5 percent chance of recalling it later. Videotaped lectures help. When students viewed a video twice, they recorded 53 percent of the details, up from 38 percent, Dr. Kiewra says. Watching three times raised it to 60 percent. Memory is a weak tool, but thinking about the information  —   paraphrasing rather than writing everything verbatim  —   improves retention, according to a series of studies at Princeton, published last April in Psychological Science. Students who took notes by hand rather than laptop wrote less but performed better. Laptop users tended to merely transcribe a lecture “rather than processing and reframing it in their own words” they scored strikingly lower on conceptual tests. Alexandra E. Hadley, a Boston College junior who has posted 29 different offerings on Flashnotes in the last year, uses paper for small discussion classes and a laptop for lectures. An English and communications major, she says she thinks hard about points the professor stresses. “I try to be very present in all of my classes,” she says. “That is key  —   focusing on what I am doing. ” That means considering points as you take notes and connecting new ideas with information from earlier lectures. “I was taking notes in my research methods class and we were talking about pop culture,” she says. “We touched on two theories, but it reminded me of another one, so I threw that in my notes. ” Umar Zaidi, a Stony Brook senior from Queens   in political science and sociology, prefers to grab a seat near a power outlet and tap away. “When you are typing you can look at your professor,” he says. He reads over the syllabus before class, “so when the professor mentions something that rings a bell, I type it up. ” While typing he organizes material into sections with main ideas, bullet points and asterisks. Mr. Zaidi uploaded a semester’s worth of lecture notes for “Urban Politics,” an   course, when NerdyNotes started up last spring. Sales, at $10 a packet, were slow at first. (Biology notes are the most in demand on campus.) Classmates didn’t take notes, he says, because they thought political science was a breeze  —   until the midterm. After, he netted $150. “If they’re too lazy to make notes,” he says, “then I’ll make notes and take advantage. ” But Mr. Zaidi won’t sell the study guides he makes for himself. One doesn’t want to make it too easy for classmates. Indeed, some campuses are not good   territory because students don’t want to help competitors. In other words, at Flashnotes, Mr. Matousek says, “we’re not putting a huge emphasis on Harvard. ”	1
249	NEW ORLEANS  —   James Harden was staying out of it. “They’re two grown men,” Harden, the Houston Rockets’   guard, said ahead of Sunday night’s N. B. A.   Game. “They have to figure it out themselves. ” He was referring to the continuing rift between Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook, two former teammates who do not seem to like each other much these days. Their weekend here was an awkward reunion for two global icons, both   for the Western Conference. As such, they were obliged to share oxygen, if not much else, at Smoothie King Center. Perhaps there was a brief détente for the West’s   victory over the East. In the first quarter, Westbrook came off the bench to join Durant on the floor. On their fourth possession together, Durant tossed a lob to Westbrook for a dunk. Their teammates erupted on the bench, and it appeared as though Westbrook and Durant were capable of coexisting, at least for one night. “He threw a lob,” Westbrook said. “That’s all that happened. Just threw a lob. It’s basketball. ” In a game completely devoid of actual competition and anything that remotely resembled defense, Anthony Davis of the New Orleans Pelicans set an   Game record with 52 points on his home floor, breaking a mark held by Wilt Chamberlain, and was named the game’s most valuable player. Westbrook scored 41 points, and Durant had 21 to go along with 10 rebounds and 10 assists. Once upon a time, Durant and Westbrook played together for the Oklahoma City Thunder. Last summer, Durant left for the Golden State Warriors in free agency. Westbrook was not pleased. According to various accounts, their only communication in the many months since Durant’s departure came a little over a week ago, when they screamed at each other in the second half of a Warriors victory in Oklahoma City. Before Sunday’s game, they proved equally adept at avoiding the mere mention of the other person’s name. Durant, for example, was asked how he dealt with potential distractions. “Sometimes it’s tough,” he said. “But when you just block it out, it’s kind of easy. Don’t look at stuff and don’t pay attention. Stuff that you guys think is important, I don’t think it’s important at all. When you look at it that way, it’s pretty easy to me. ” As for Westbrook, he refused even to dip his toes into the topic. Consider his response to a question about being in the same locker room as Durant. “Man, you know what? Fashion week has been great,” Westbrook said. “You seen fashion week? You pay attention to fashion week? A lot of   things in fashion week. New collections. ” An intrepid reporter attempted to ask a   about Durant. Take it away, Russ. “Man, you seen the new Public School clothing? Crazy,” Westbrook said. “They got the new Jordan hoodie with M. J. It’s crazy, man. A lot of new great things with fashion week I’ve seen, man. What else is out? Gucci. The new Gucci stuff is dope. It’s good stuff, man. ” At Saturday’s public practice at the Superdome, Westbrook and Durant kept their distance. Whenever possible  —   which was often  —   they took up residence at opposite ends of the court. Warriors Coach Steve Kerr, who coached the West   said he had no intention of organizing any kind of meeting between the two to work on healing their feud. That was not his job. “The only thing I want is for our players to enjoy the weekend,” Kerr said. “It’s a hectic weekend for all of them. It’s a great honor to be here. I want everybody to be comfortable and happy. ” It should be noted, of course, that Durant and Westbrook are both in the process of assembling remarkable seasons. Durant, a   forward, is averaging 25. 8 points, 8. 3 rebounds and 4. 9 assists for the Warriors, who have a     record. He is also shooting a   53. 9 percent from the field, a product of his own improvement, along with the ability of his   teammates to draw defensive attention. Durant and Stephen Curry have developed into a particularly dynamic tandem. There is always a period of adjustment when players are new to each other, Kerr said, especially when they are superstars. But Curry and Durant are almost unstoppable when they are on the court together. Then add to that the set of challenges Klay Thompson creates from the   line. “It’s amazing how quickly they’ve adapted to each other,” Kerr said. “I think Steph had the bigger adjustment, frankly, because he was trying to incorporate K. D. into our group. But I think it turned for Steph when he realized he didn’t have to do anything differently. He could just be himself, and be aggressive and look to score. ” In Durant’s absence, Westbrook has hauled the Thunder to a   record. He is averaging 31. 1 points and 10. 5 rebounds, both career highs, along with 10. 1 assists. He is bidding to become only the second player to average a    —   double figures in three of five major statistical categories  —   for an entire season. Oscar Robertson did it in  . With Durant, though, the Thunder were title contenders. Last season, they took the Warriors to seven games in the conference finals  —   and probably would have advanced to face the Cleveland Cavaliers in the N. B. A. finals had Thompson failed to engineer some   heroics. Without Durant, the Thunder are determined overachievers. The joke goes that they are only one player away from being back in the hunt for a title. (That player now lives in the Bay Area.) Despite all that, Westbrook said: “I’m in a great place. I’m happy. I’m having fun. ” Westbrook was already a competitive individual before Durant left town. But Durant’s departure appears to have motivated Westbrook even more, no small feat. And in that way, despite their clear differences, Westbrook and Durant remain connected. Westbrook feeds off the anger, uses it as fuel. This is his version of happiness. This is the way he has fun.	1
177	It first spread on social media, rippling through immigrant communities like the opposite of fear and rumor: a call to boycott. In the New York region and around the country, many cooks, carpenters, plumbers and grocery store owners decided to answer it and not work on Thursday as part of a national “day without immigrants” in protest of the Trump administration’s policies toward them. The protest called for immigrants, whether naturalized citizens or undocumented, to stay home from work or school, close their businesses and abstain from shopping. People planned for it in restaurant staff meetings, on construction sites and on commuter buses, but the movement spread mostly on Facebook and via WhatsApp, the messaging service. No national group organized the action. “It’s like the Arab Spring,” said Manuel Castro, the executive director of NICE, short for New Immigrant Community Empowerment, which works primarily with Hispanic immigrant day laborers in Jackson Heights, Queens. “Our members were coming to us, asking what the plan was. Frankly, it kind of came out of nowhere. ” But what began as a   movement quickly reached the highest levels of federal government. In Washington, the Pentagon warned its employees that a number of its food concessions, including Sbarro’s, Starbucks and Taco Bell, were closed because immigrant employees had stayed home and that they could expect longer lines at restaurants that were open. Restaurants, from San Francisco to Phoenix to Washington, D. C. were some of the most visible spots affected, with   chefs closing some of their eateries for the day in support. Rick Bayless, the Chicago chef and owner of the Frontera Grill, closed several of his restaurants and said he would give a portion of the revenue from the ones that remained open to an immigrant and refugee rights group. “What really makes our country great is the diversity we experience here,” Mr. Bayless said in an interview. “I can’t say enough about the lack of respect and the   and   that I’m sensing around us these days. ” Some people felt that the support of immigrants who are undocumented was wrongheaded. “Of course, nobody wants to do without immigrants  —   they are what made America,” Sarah Crysl Akhtar, 67, a writer in Lebanon, N. H. said in a telephone interview. “But there is a difference between legal immigrants and illegal aliens. ” The latter, she said, “bring down the quality of life for everyone. ” Some schools and   centers across the country experienced a drop in attendance. At KIPP Austin Comunidad, a   charter school in Austin, Tex. one teacher posted on Twitter that only seven of her 26 students came to school on Thursday. “Some of our school buses were coming to school with two and four children on them,” said Sarah Gonzales, a   bilingual teacher at the school. “Nothing like this has ever happened before. ” By the end of the day, the KIPP Austin Public Schools network executive director, Steven Epstein, said only 60 percent of students attended its 10 schools with 5, 000 students. Usually the attendance rate is 98 percent or above. At Siler City Elementary School in rural North Carolina, where 65 percent of the school population is Hispanic, 263 of the 662 students were absent on Thursday. Just 18 were absent on Wednesday, said John McCann, a spokesman for the county school district. Still, cities did not grind to a halt, and for most people, the action registered as an inconvenience  —   a longer wait for lunch, a favorite restaurant closed, a bus driver who wasn’t there. In the Hasidic neighborhood of Borough Park, Brooklyn, some customers noticed the absence of the usual Latino immigrant employees at their local stores. “I thought, ‘Oy, my coffee will not be as good as any day,’ but I felt, ‘Good for them, they are standing up for their rights,” said Rabbi Joel Labin, 34, a writer and activist who shopped at Center Fresh market. “We grew up with these stories. I hear from my grandparents the issue of immigration from Europe. I feel like it’s kind of my story, too. ” Mexican workers participated in large numbers in New York. In Sunset Park, Brooklyn, most bakeries and taquerias were closed, and a public library was crowded with parents and children they kept home from school. But the action was not limited to Hispanic immigrants: On several blocks in Midwood, Brooklyn, virtually all stores were shuttered on Thursday as part of a protest planned by Pakistani shop owners. There, an auto repair shop on Coney Island Avenue posted a handmade sign on its   metal shutter: “We Are Immigrants. ” The driver of a discount shuttle bus outside the Port Authority Bus Terminal, Sam Ahmad, originally from Egypt, said on Wednesday night that he was not going to work on Thursday and many members of his mosque in New Jersey would not, either. Asked why, Mr. Ahmad, 57, said, “Because that crazy guy,” he said, referring to President Trump. “Because I’m Muslim and I got a lot of family here. They can get separated, and it’s not right. Our children are born here and grow up here. ” In downtown Newark, a   gathering outside the stately Essex County Hall of Records started with only a couple dozen protesters and turned into a spirited event when students from nearby Science Park High School charged in with signs, banners and chants. “We are loud, we are clear, immigrants are welcome here,” they said, drawing honks from cheering passing motorists. Gina Alvarado, one of the students, said the plan to ditch school for the rally had spread spontaneously Thursday morning via social media, texts and   . In Manhattan, the flower district, mostly concentrated on West 28th Street, was as quiet as the wholesale jewelry and garment district around it. At one point, two construction workers from a nearby site took a coffee and cigarette break. “Half the job didn’t come in,” said Joe Burns, 32. “About 10 people, Spanish guys,” he added. “We’ve got to labor for ourselves today. ” It did seem that in New York, at least, pockets of the nonunion construction industry were shut down. A    carpenter from Cuenca, Ecuador, who gave only his first name, Santiago, said in Spanish that at his construction site in Astoria, Queens, a supervisor asked on Wednesday whether workers were coming the next day. They were not, the workers told him. About 500 people from several companies were employed at the site, Santiago said, including carpenters, electricians and plumbers. The Davis Museum at Wellesley College took an innovative approach to the protest. It removed or cloaked 120 works of art that had either been created by an immigrant or donated by an immigrant  —   about 20 percent of the museum’s display. With entire galleries shrouded in black felt and placards replacing paintings, the director of the museum, Lisa Fischman said, “I’ve been calling it an intervention, because it takes what we have and reframes it. ” The protest seemed to get less traction in downtown Boston, with a few restaurants and stores closing. Still, a number of places posted supportive messages on social media, such as one from Eataly Boston, the Italian marketplace, which showed a picture of pasta, olive oil, wine, coffee beans and other goods with the headline: “We were all imported. ”	1

201	LOS ANGELES  —   In a courtroom here on Friday, the defense attorney Dick DeGuerin went on the attack on behalf of his client, the New York real estate scion Robert A. Durst, who is accused of murdering a close friend, Susan Berman, 17 years ago. Prosecutors say Mr. Durst shot her in the back of her head to prevent her from revealing what she knew about the disappearance of his first wife, Kathleen Durst. Confronting Mr. Durst’s former friend Nick Chavin, who in sensational testimony on Thursday said that Mr. Durst had admitted the killing to him, Mr. DeGuerin quickly set the tone: “It took seven months for you to come up with the story about Bob Durst confessing to you?” he said. Mr. DeGuerin was referring to conversations between Mr. Chavin and Deputy District Attorney John Lewin during seven months in 2015, when Mr. Chavin has said he was grappling with whether to tell Mr. Lewin what Mr. Durst had told him. The actual trial is still as much as a year away, and Mr. Chavin’s appearance in Los Angeles Superior Court was part of an unusual proceeding known as a conditional examination. In such an examination, prosecutors can question witnesses before a trial if they are 65 or older and in danger of dying or being killed before the case is heard. Defense lawyers can   the witnesses, and the proceedings are videotaped in case the witnesses are not available to testify at trial. Mr. Chavin, 72, testified over three days about the arc of his friendship with Mr. Durst. For decades, he defended his friend against accusations he had killed his first wife and Ms. Berman. Then, he said, Mr. Durst asked him to dinner at a Harlem restaurant, Barawine, in 2014, saying he wanted to talk about “Kathie and Susan. ” The two men had finished their meal without broaching the topic. But then, on the sidewalk outside, Mr. Chavin recalled Mr. Durst saying: “I had to. It was her or me. I had no choice. ” Mr. Chavin continued, “He turned to walk away. I said, ‘You wanted to talk about Kathie.’ He kept walking away. ” Until this week, Mr. Chavin had been referred to in hearings as the “mystery witness,” because his identity had not been revealed. In explaining the need to take his testimony, Mr. Lewin told Superior Court Judge Mark E. Windham that Mr. Durst, whose net worth is estimated at $100 million, “kills witnesses. ” “When pushed into a corner,” Mr. Lewin said, as Mr. Durst watched from the defense table, “he murders people. ” During   on Friday, Mr. DeGuerin repeatedly referred to transcripts of conversations between Mr. Chavin and the prosecutor, in which Mr. Chavin told different versions of what happened at the dinner. In one version, he said Mr. Durst had said nothing about his wife or Ms. Berman. In another, he said that as they were parting he reminded Mr. Durst that he had wanted to talk about the women. Mr. Durst responded, “Next time. ” Also citing transcripts, Mr. DeGuerin suggested Mr. Chavin had concocted the confession to get work from the Durst Organization, the real estate firm owned by Mr. Durst’s estranged family, and the gratitude of Douglas Durst, Robert’s brother. Mr. Chavin ultimately did not get the job. Mr. Chavin said he struggled for months over whether to reveal what had happened at the dinner with a man he once regarded as his best friend. His answers were merely an attempt to “waffle,” he said, until he came to a decision. ”I deliberated many months about what I wanted to say,” Mr. Chavin told Mr. DeGuerin. The case against Mr. Durst is circumstantial there were no witnesses to Ms. Berman’s death. And Mr. Durst has never been charged in his wife’s disappearance. Her body has never been found. In interviews with The New York Times over the past 17 years, Mr. Chavin described his friend, whom he called Bobby, as a genius who understood real estate and had a dry sense of humor and eccentric habits. Mr. Durst was a best man at Mr. Chavin’s 1988 wedding. Mr. Chavin had introduced Mr. Durst to the woman who would become his second wife, Debrah Lee Charatan. Mr. Chavin had worked for the Durst Organization his wife, Terry Chavin, had worked for Ms. Charatan before joining the company as a real estate agent. Mr. Chavin’s decision to become a prosecution witness two years ago represented a remarkable turnabout in his friendship with Mr. Durst. Mr. Chavin testified that Mr. Durst’s admission during a 2003 trial in Galveston, Tex. that he had sat in a pool of blood and dismembered the body of a neighbor shook the “primary foundations” of his belief that Mr. Durst was not violent. Mr. Durst was acquitted in that case after saying the death was an accident during a struggle to defend himself. Mr. Chavin’s friendship with Ms. Berman came first. He testified he was an aspiring musician in California fronting a band, Country Porn, in the 1970s when he met Ms. Berman, a reporter for The San Francisco Examiner. “We felt like kindred spirits,” Mr. Chavin recalled during testimony that began Wednesday. But Mr. Chavin decided in 1980 it was time to get a “day job” and moved to New York, where Ms. Berman was working as a magazine writer. Mr. Chavin got a job as an advertising copywriter. Ms. Berman introduced him to Mr. Durst, whom she had met in Los Angeles in the 1960s. Mr. Durst helped Mr. Chavin propel his career with a $   account to advertise a skyscraper built by the Durst family. Then, in February 1982, New York’s tabloids were filled with stories on the disappearance of Kathleen Durst. Ms. Berman dealt with reporters on Mr. Durst’s behalf, but confided in Mr. Chavin more than once that Mr. Durst had admitted killing his wife. “Susan said to me specifically,” Mr. Chavin recounted, “‘Bob killed Kathie. ’” He refused to believe her. In 2001, Mr. Chavin told The Times that Ms. Berman “was sensationalistic about everything. ” Nevertheless, Ms. Berman was intent on shielding Mr. Durst, Mr. Chavin testified. She said nothing could be done about Kathleen Durst’s death and they should protect their friend, he told the court. Mr. Lewin, the deputy district attorney, asked Mr. Chavin why he had never contacted the police, instead waiting until investigators approached him in 2001. “It didn’t seem it was my place,” he said. Mr. Durst stopped talking to Mr. Chavin in the   after Mr. Durst’s father, Seymour, and his uncle decided to bypass Robert and designate his younger brother, Douglas, to take the helm of the Durst Organization. After a New York State Police investigator reopened the investigation into the disappearance of Mrs. Durst in 2000, Mr. Chavin told a reporter that he missed his friend and never believed that Mr. Durst had killed his wife, despite what Ms. Berman had said. “She always maintained that he confessed to her,” Mr. Chavin said. “I never bought it. ” But in December 2000, the police found Ms. Berman dead. Mr. Chavin subsequently told investigators what Susan had told him, but still insisted she was an unreliable storyteller. Eight months later, Mr. Durst was arrested in Galveston, where he was accused of murdering a neighbor in a rooming house he had rented while posing as a mute woman. Mr. Chavin was dumbfounded, but still believed his friend was innocent. Mr. Durst called Mr. Chavin from jail, asking him to come to Galveston for moral support. Mr. Chavin declined. But in 2014, Mr. Durst began calling Mr. Chavin again and the men reunited. They had dinner and talked about old times. Mr. Durst urged Mr. Chavin to sit for an interview with producers who were making a documentary for HBO about his life. Mr. Chavin testified he told Mr. Durst that participating in the documentary was a bad idea, but he persisted anyway. After the fifth part of the documentary was broadcast, Mr. Durst disappeared again. Prosecutors in Los Angeles issued an arrest warrant. He was apprehended in New Orleans on March 14, the night before the final episode aired. In that episode, Mr. Durst uttered, “What did I do? Killed them all, of course. ”	1
985	 BREAKING: Roy Moore’s Accuser Arrested And Charged With Falsification Roy Moore accuser admits she forged part of yearbook inscription attributed to Alabama senate candidate. An update to this story reflects that Beverly Young Nelson admits writing what ABC News characterized as “notes” beneath what she says is Roy Moore’s signature, and that the only notes below the signature are the date and location. Furthermore, the headline on story now specifies that Nelson admits to writing part of the inscription herself, rather than forging part of it. After it was discovered that Roy Moore’s accuser is a liar and a Democrat, Alabama Attorney General John Simmons filed charges of falsification, a 1st-degree misdemeanor. Mary Lynne Davies, who said Roy Moore seduced and molested her when she was 14-years-old and he was in his early 30s, now faces a year in prison and $10K in fines.The revelation came after the yearbook inscription that Moore supposedly wrote in the 1970s turned out to be a forgery. Davies, who tried desperately to convince anyone who would listen that Moore raped her, is now in hiding after posting $500 in bail money. Everything on this website is fiction.

209	Since President Trump appointed Sebastian Gorka last month as a deputy assistant, Mr. Gorka has been an increasingly visible defender of the administration. He has spoken out in favor of the targeted travel ban, which spurred mass protests and was then blocked by federal courts. He suggested in a recent interview with The Hill that the CNN anchor Jake Tapper was sexist for aggressively questioning the Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway. He has also insisted that media reports of turmoil in the White House bear “almost no resemblance to reality. ” Mr. Gorka came out swinging again on Thursday, after Mr. Trump’s contentious news conference in which he excoriated the media. Asked by Evan Davis of the BBC to assess Mr. Trump’s appearance, Mr. Gorka repeatedly declared the president’s performance “fabulous. ” “It’s only weird to journalists like yourself, who are biased,” he said. Who is he? Here’s what we know: Mr. Gorka is an American citizen who was born in Britain to Hungarian parents. He earned a Ph. D. in political science from Corvinus University of Budapest and has made his living as a national security expert with a focus on Islamist extremism. He wrote a   book, published last year, called “Defeating Jihad: The Winnable War. ” In his Breitbart articles, he has criticized foreign policy under the Obama administration and trumpeted the threat of the Islamic State group. Mr. Gorka, 46, is a former editor for the   media outlet Breitbart News and a friend of Stephen Bannon, the former Breitbart chairman who is now a powerful assistant to Mr. Trump. Until recently, Mr. Gorka was not well known to Washington policy makers. But his increasing visibility has brought headlines, some less welcome than others. He has appeared in a number of television and radio interviews as a representative of the Trump administration and a member of a White House team called the Strategic Initiatives Group. The Daily Beast called it a think tank within the White House that was set up by Mr. Bannon and the president’s    and senior adviser, Jared Kushner. The group’s formation raised red flags, said Julianne Smith, a former deputy national security adviser to Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and the director of strategy and statecraft at the Center for a New American Security. The National Security Council has traditionally played a decisive role in foreign policy decisions, she said. “Now we have the Strategic Initiatives Group and the National Security Council both working on issues of national security and strategy. So my question on Sebastian, ultimately, is: Who is he reporting to? Is he reporting to the National Security Council? Or is this a direct line to Bannon?” Mr. Gorka said he could not comment for this article without clearance from the White House. But after multiple calls and emails since Tuesday, neither he nor the White House has answered questions about his position or the role of the initiatives group. This month, Mr. Gorka told CNN that the group would bring private industry expertise to bear on a range of issues, including cybersecurity, veterans affairs and the modernization of government technological systems. “That is very different from what the National Security Council is doing every day under the sterling leadership of General Flynn,” he added, referring to Michael T. Flynn, then the national security adviser, who would resign 12 days later. Ms. Smith said she was not personally familiar with Mr. Gorka, though she had crossed paths with him during the early 2000s. “I don’t know what to believe about this guy, but given his experience at Breitbart and what I had heard years ago, it does appear to me that he takes some rather extreme views,” she said. Mr. Gorka dismissed such criticisms during a Wednesday interview with Sean Hannity of Fox News and brushed aside some of the more controversial reports buzzing around him. “I think we’re doing our job very well  —   don’t you, Sean?  —   if this is the best they can do,” he said. He referred to reports, like one from Fusion, that said he had exaggerated his role as an expert witness in the trial of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, who was convicted of helping to carry out the Boston bombing of 2013. Mr. Gorka told Mr. Hannity he still had invoices for the expert report he submitted for the case. “I may not have taken the stand, but I was an expert on the Boston bombing trial,” he said. As for the speculations about  Nazi sympathies, they go back to one of Mr. Trump’s inauguration balls, when Mr. Gorka  —   appearing in photos and a video interview with Mr. Hannity  —   wore a medal that could be interpreted as a nod to Miklos Horthy, a Hungarian leader who entered into a strained alliance with Nazi Germany in the early years of World War II. In a video posted by Breitbart on Tuesday, Mr. Gorka said the medal belonged to his father, who he said had suffered “under both the Nazis and the Communists” in Hungary, having lived through World War II and survived torture under the   government that later came to power. Mr. Gorka was charged with a misdemeanor after he took  a handgun into Reagan National Airport in Virginia last year. In a statement quoted by Breitbart, he said that on his way to the airport, he had “grabbed the wrong bag, one I had just used” at a gun range. He added that he was allowed to board his flight, and that the weapon was confiscated. The charge was dropped early this month. Though his appointment to the White House occurred only recently, Mr. Gorka has been in touch with Mr. Trump at least since 2015. He wrote last year that he had submitted some policy papers to the presidential candidate and had met with him twice to discuss national security issues. Federal election commission filings indicate that the Trump campaign paid $8, 000 to Mr. Gorka for policy consulting in 2015. It is difficult to predict the impact Mr. Gorka could have on foreign policy in the White House, Ms. Smith said, especially since he is apparently working under the shadowy aegis of Mr. Bannon. “We’ve got a situation where both outsiders and certain members of the government are confused about who is serving as the lead on foreign policy decisions,” she said. “And because we are not clear about Steve Bannon’s role, it raises a lot of concern because of his personal views, and also his lack of experience. ”	1
726	 Chevy Chase, An American Icon who helped make family vacations fun again, died Monday in his Bedford, New York home. A spokesperson for the family, Ed Kramer, said Chevy died of a heart attack in his sleep overnight and passed away without pain.Born into a prominent New York family, Chase worked a plethora of odd jobs before he moved into comedy and began acting with National Lampoon. He quickly became a key cast member in the inaugural season of Saturday Night Live, where his weekend updates soon became a staple of the show. Chase appeared on Saturday Night Live once again in 2013 and was joined by old time “SNL” hosts Paul Simon, Tom Hanks, Alec Baldwin, Candace Bergen, Steve Martin, Martin Short and Dan Aykroyd.	0
559	 A New York woman is thanking the makers of an anti-rape device saying that it “saved her from being raped and brutally assaulted.” Michelle Kingston says she was walking home from work in the afternoon on Sunday when a man jumped out of a side alley and grabbed her. “I couldn’t scream, it happened so quick. He put his hand over my mouth and threatened me with a knife. I stayed calm and complied knowing he was about to get the karma he deserved.”The ‘Karma’ that Kingston describes is a device that was purchased for her by her grandfather. “I wanted my granddaughter to be safe, so I purchased this anti-rape device for her,” said Mitchell Kingston, the grandfather. “She fussed about it, but finally gave in. She’s gorgeous and only 18 and I don’t want her to be taken advantage of or assaulted. She walks to and from work every day in the city, and rapes happen multiple times per day. That punk got would he deserved.”According to Kingston, the minute he penetrated his victim, the device sliced his genitals with 6 razors in one clean sweep. Then, the device slices down one more time on its way out. The perpetrator fell to the ground screaming in agony, which gave Kingston the time to run and call police on her cell phone. The man, 38-year-old Ronald Steadway, was transported to a nearby hospital where his penis had to be surgically removed. Nothing has ever been done to help a woman so that she does not get raped and I thought it was high time,” Sonette Ehlers, 57, said of the “rapex”, a device worn like a tampon that has sparked controversy in a country used to daily reports of violent crime.Ehlers said the “rapex” hooks onto the rapist’s skin, allowing the victim time to escape and helping to identify perpetrators.“He will obviously be too preoccupied at this stage,” she told reporters. “I promise you he is going to be too sore. He will go straight to hospital.”	0
419	SpaceX, the ambitious rocket company headed by Elon Musk, wants to send a couple of tourists around the moon and back to Earth before the end of next year. If they manage that feat, the passengers would be the first humans to venture that far into space in more than 40 years. Mr. Musk made the announcement on Monday in a telephone news conference. He said two private individuals approached the company to see if SpaceX would be willing to send them on a weeklong cruise, which would fly past the surface of the moon  —   but not land  —   and continue outward before gravity turned the spacecraft around and brought it back to Earth for a landing. “This would do a long loop around the moon,” Mr. Musk said. The company is aiming to launch this moon mission in late 2018. The two people would spend about a week inside one of SpaceX’s Dragon 2 capsules, launched on SpaceX’s Falcon Heavy rocket. The spacecraft would be automated, but the travelers would undergo training for emergencies. Mr. Musk did not say how much the travelers would pay for the ride. “A little bit more than the cost of a crewed mission to the space station would be,” he said. The Falcon Heavy itself has a list price of $90 million. While the trip appears to be within the technical capabilities of SpaceX, industry experts wondered whether the company could pull it off as quickly as Mr. Musk indicated. “Dates are not SpaceX’s strong suit,” said Mary Lynne Dittmar, executive director of the Coalition for Deep Space Exploration, a space advocacy group consisting of aerospace companies. The Dragon 2 and Falcon Heavy are years behind schedule and have yet to fly. “It strikes me as risky,” Dr. Dittmar said, adding that autonomous systems are not infallible. “I find it extraordinary that these sorts of announcements are being made when SpaceX has yet to get crew from the ground to   orbit. ” Last week, a crewless Dragon capsule taking cargo to the International Space Station aborted its rendezvous because of a glitch. It successfully arrived a day later. Mr. Musk said the two   private space travelers wished to remain anonymous for now. He declined to describe them, except to say they knew each other. Seven space tourists have paid tens of millions of dollars to fly on Russian Soyuz rockets to visit the International Space Station, which is about 200 miles above the Earth’s surface. This would be a much more distant trip. The moon is about a quarter million miles away, and the trajectory would take the capsule 300, 000 to 400, 000 miles from Earth. No astronauts have ventured beyond   orbit since the last of NASA’s Apollo moon landings in 1972. NASA is working on a rocket, the Space Launch System, and a capsule, Orion, that would be capable of taking astronauts to deep space once again. But that first launch, without anyone on board, is scheduled for late next year, taking a path similar to what Mr. Musk has proposed for his space tourists. This month, NASA announced it is looking at the possibility of putting astronauts on the first flight, but officials say that would probably delay the launch to 2019. The rocket that SpaceX would use for the voyage is more powerful than its current Falcon 9 workhorse, but not as large as NASA’s. When Mr. Musk announced the Falcon Heavy in 2011, he said it would fly in 2013. The maiden flight is now scheduled for this summer. SpaceX has a contract to take NASA astronauts to the International Space Station using the Dragon 2 capsule launched on the Falcon 9 rocket. That program has also encountered delays. SpaceX is scheduled to launch a crewless test flight this year and take its few NASA passengers next spring, although a report by the Government Accountability Office has cast doubt that SpaceX would be able to do it that quickly. NASA has financed much of SpaceX’s spacecraft development, and Mr. Musk said the agency has priority. If NASA wants to put its astronauts on the Falcon Heavy’s first moon flight, he said, SpaceX will comply. But the Falcon Heavy has not been through NASA’s rigorous reviews to be judged safe for astronauts.	1
54	Kay Abramowitz has been working, with a few breaks, since she was 14. Now 76, she is a partner in a law firm in Portland, Ore.  —   with no intention of stopping anytime soon. “Retirement or death is always on the horizon, but I have no plans,” she said. “I’m actually having way too much fun. ” The arc of women’s working lives is changing  —   reaching higher levels when they’re younger and stretching out much longer  —   according to two new analyses of census, earnings and retirement data that provide the most comprehensive look yet at women’s career paths. Over all, the paths look much more like men’s careers than they used to. Women are more likely than in previous generations to work at almost every point in their lives, including in their 20s and 30s when they often used to be home with children. Now, if mothers take breaks at all, it’s often not until their late 30s or early 40s  —   and those who leave are likely to return to the labor force. Most striking, women have become significantly more likely to work into their 60s and even 70s, often full time, according to the analyses. And many of these women report that they do it because they enjoy it. The data adds a bright chapter to the narrative of women’s progress in the world of work. Even though their participation in the labor force in the United States has flattened in recent years, and as mothers especially face serious challenges, women are working more than ever and getting fulfillment, not just income, from their jobs. Nearly 30 percent of women 65 to 69 are working, up from 15 percent in the late 1980s, one of the analyses, by the Harvard economists Claudia Goldin and Lawrence Katz, found. Eighteen percent of women 70 to 74 work, up from 8 percent. This rejection of retirement is more common among women with higher education and savings, though not confined to them. Those who are not working are more likely to have poor health and low savings, and to be dependent on Social Security and sometimes disability benefits, Ms. Goldin said. Of those still working, Ms. Goldin said, “They’re in occupations in which they really have an identity. ” She added, “Women have more education, they’re in jobs that are more fulfilling, and they stay with them. ” (Ms. Goldin happens to be an example of the phenomenon, as a    professor and researcher.) Men’s employment after age 60 has also risen, since about 1994, but not as steeply as women’s. About 60 percent of men 60 to 64 work, and just over half of women in that age range do. The two new studies draw their data from the Health and Retirement Study at the University of Michigan and from the Current Population Survey and the Survey of Income and Program Participation at the Census Bureau. The data included surveys that tracked the same women over time in some cases, the researchers studied respondents’ income tax and Social Security records. Women now in their 60s and 70s were the first generation to become professionals in large numbers, but that doesn’t explain all of the increase in older women who work, which began in the late 1980s. For some women, the decision to keep working was unexpected and not necessarily welcome, because of    divorce, pension or real estate losses, or changes in Social Security. A recent paper by the economists Annamaria Lusardi and Olivia S. Mitchell examined women who were working into old age because they had more debt than in previous generations and lacked financial savvy. Older workers who lost their jobs during the financial crisis were more likely to be unemployed long term  —   especially women, in part because their résumés tended to be spottier. But most of the time, Ms. Goldin and Mr. Katz found, women are working longer because of decisions they made much earlier in their lives  —   to get an education and spend years building a career. If people work when they’re younger, economists say, they’re more likely to work when they’re older. And because women are marrying and having babies later, they spend more time pursuing careers first. That means that even if they take breaks to care of children, they are likely to return to work and to work past a typical retirement age. Children had no effect on working later in life, the analysis found. The same thing is happening among women in their 60s in most developed countries, according to data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. The most telling discovery here, according to the Harvard researchers, was that women who enjoyed their jobs earlier in life were employed longer, independent of their education or earnings. When asked if they had enjoyed their jobs six to eight years earlier, 85 to 90 percent of women ages 59 to 63 said they had. College graduates are more likely to work into older age. Of women born between 1945 and 1949, about 50 percent in all education groups were working at age 64, compared with 60 percent of college graduates. But the participation rates of women without degrees are increasing at roughly the same pace. Diane Tavoian, 64, left college at 21 and worked hourly customer service jobs in manufacturing, in the military and most recently at the post office. She briefly tried retirement at age 61, but it didn’t last long: “It was just plain boring,” she said. She is now a barista at Starbucks and finishing her bachelor’s degree through the company’s tuition coverage program. “The money is nice, of course, but I did it because I found I could not just stay at home,” said Ms. Tavoian, who lives in Covington, Tex. “I really like the fast pace of it, and I like showing the younger baristas that a frail old lady cannot just keep up with them but pass them by. ” Lee Ann Monfredini, 68, got her real estate license at age 53 after a career in hospital   and nonprofit consulting she was out of the work force for several years when her children were young. “I feel 40,” said Ms. Monfredini, a broker in San Francisco. “I play bridge once a week and have lunch with women, but I’m really not that good at the retirement thing. And I love the joy of getting that big commission check. ” There is just one period of life when women are less likely to be working than in previous generations: their late 30s and early 40s, according to the other new paper, by Ms. Goldin and Joshua Mitchell, a senior economist at the Census Bureau. Starting with women born in the   more worked at ages 25 to 34 than at ages 35 to 44. Among   women born between 1965 and 1969, 82 percent worked at ages 40 to 44, compared with 85 percent of women in that age group who were born decade earlier. The decrease in participation is small but noticeable, and is linked to having children. The dip is happening later than it once did because people are having babies later, and because the most recent generations of mothers tend to keep working after their first child is born. The proportion of mothers who quit after their first birth decreased to 19 percent in the early 2000s, from 28 percent in the 1980s, the new research found. “They try as hard as they can they don’t leave after the first kid or when they’re infants or toddlers,” Ms. Goldin said. “They leave later on. ” There are several reasons for that decrease in participation, economists have found: the long hours expected in the American workplace inflexibility on where and when work gets done elder care responsibilities and the lack of paid parental leave,   work and affordable,   child care. It’s too early to know, but the evidence indicates that even these women are likely to go back to work and to work longer, particularly if they have degrees, Ms. Goldin said. Helen Young Hayes managed $50 billion in investments at a mutual fund in Denver while raising five children. She missed spending more time with them  —   she watched videos of them after they went to bed  —   and five children were a lot of work. So, at 41, she stopped working. A decade later, she returned to the work force, starting a corporation to match   people with careers. The idea grew out of volunteer work she had done during her time away. “I just have too much energy and too much intensity to not be engaged,” said Ms. Young Hayes, 54. Working for 20 years before she left made   easier, she said. “It gave me the confidence to realize there were no limits to my career. ”	1
2	The sale of a major league sports team always draws attention and local interest. But this one may attract even more interest, especially around the White House. The Kushners, the New York real estate family whose scion is a close adviser to President Trump, are in negotiations to buy the Miami Marlins baseball team, according to people with direct knowledge of the matter. The Kushners  —   led by Joshua Kushner, a venture capitalist, and Joseph Meyer, his    and key lieutenant for the family’s investments  —   have pursued the Marlins for several months, devising a complicated financial arrangement that would include bringing in partners later, these people said. Mr. Kushner is the younger brother of Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump’s   . Neither Jared Kushner, who married Ivanka Trump in 2009 and is a top White House adviser, nor Charles Kushner, the family patriarch who spent over a year in prison for illegal campaign donations, tax evasion and witness tampering, is participating in the effort, these people said. Yet it was unclear whether a deal would be reached, or whether the family would prevail in any bidding contest. Forbes reported on Thursday that the team had a “handshake agreement” to sell the team for about $1. 6 billion, a figure that the people involved in the process said the Kushner family has contended was too high and refused to pay. Any deal would have to win the approval of Major League Baseball, which would closely scrutinize the buyer’s financing and would probably seek to ensure that Charles Kushner had no role in operations. The deal has already prompted questions within Major League Baseball, according to the people briefed on the conversations, about what kind of relationship Mr. Trump would have to the team and whether that would be a benefit or a disadvantage. Would fans or sponsors boycott or embrace the team or league based on a comment or Twitter post by Mr. Trump? And would Mr. Trump attend games? While Jared Kushner has not been not involved in the bidding for the Marlins  —   and he has pledged to be   from any of the family’s businesses  —   he and his brother had bid for the Los Angeles Dodgers in 2012, though they eventually withdrew from the bidding. The winner was a group backed by the financial firm Guggenheim Partners, which paid over $2 billion. As part of the financing for the Kushners’ bid, which was being shepherded by the boutique investment bank LionTree, the family would plan to bring in additional partners to help defray the costs. Representatives for the Kushners, the Marlins and LionTree declined to comment. Some of the people with knowledge of the Kushners’ bid said that Joshua Kushner, drawing upon his experience investing in technology companies like Instagram, saw potential profits in capitalizing on the Marlins’ digital rights. The Marlins are currently owned by Jeffrey Loria, who paid $158 million for the team in 2002 after selling the Montreal Expos back to Major League Baseball. The team won the World Series in 2003  —   when they defeated the Yankees  —   but has not returned to the playoffs since. Still, Mr. Loria persuaded   County to sell bonds to finance the construction of a new $639 million stadium. Critics of the agreement argued that the bond sale could eventually cost Miami taxpayers more than $1 billion. And there is one other potential wrinkle that might weigh on Mr. Loria: having to pay a percentage of any sale’s profits back to the county. As part of the Marlins’ agreement with the county, Mr. Loria would owe   money if he sold the team within 11 years of signing the 2009 stadium agreement. According to The Miami Herald, the payment would be based on the team’s 2009 valuation of about $250 million it has risen since then.	1

And it overshot, because there was the fiction that – beyond violence and the abuse of a relationship of trust — there could be sexual relations between adults and children.”	0
444	WALNUT GROVE, Calif.  —   Until a few weeks ago, the   Tract in the California Delta was an island of   farmland, more than two square miles protected from the surrounding rivers and sloughs by earthen levees. Today the tract is an immense lake, up to 15 feet deep, with fish prowling the water and ducks skimming the surface. The adjacent Mokelumne River, swollen by the intense storms that have drenched the state this winter, caused a levee to break, allowing the water to rush in. Those same storms led to the recent near disaster at the Oroville Dam 100 miles north of here, which cast an uncomfortable light on the elaborate and aging network of reservoirs, aqueducts, levees and pumps that funnel water to the state’s 39 million people and its $50 billion agricultural industry. The flooding at   was unintentional, but scientists and environmental groups say deliberately creating similar areas  —   floodplains to allow the state’s rivers to overflow more naturally and benignly  —   is a way to help ease the strain on this water infrastructure, especially as climate change poses new challenges. “Nature has been dealing with the vicissitudes of water changes in California for millennia,” said Brian Stranko, director of the state water program for the Nature Conservancy, which bought the tract here, south of Sacramento, in 1999, and has long had plans to restore it. “There are certain things that nature can do that we can’t do as well. ” Moving some of the state’s 13, 000 miles of levees back from rivers to make floodplains would allow dam operators to release more water without endangering population centers. Water percolating down through the flooded land would also help recharge aquifers, which, having been severely depleted by pumping for agriculture, are subject to a new state groundwater law requiring that they eventually be made sustainable. And the flooding could restore some of the fish and wildlife habitat that existed in California’s interior valleys before intensive farming began a century ago. But as with everything else involving water in California, the subject of augmenting the state’s   gray infrastructure of concrete dams, aqueducts and other structures with floodplains and other “green” infrastructure, including   watershed forests, is one of intense debate. There are concerns that new floodplains would take farmland out of production and that allowing benign flooding would reduce the amount of reservoir water available for agriculture and other uses. “California water is complicated,” said Joshua Viers, a professor at the University of California, Merced, who was at the flooded tract last week with a team of researchers using   equipment and other instruments to monitor the changes taking place. “But I think we’re finding that there are softer paths. ” At Oroville, which was completed half a century ago during the heyday of the push to build gray infrastructure, the immediate danger is past. Trucks last week rumbled up the winding roads to the    dam, carrying rocks and other materials as crews continued to shore up an eroded spillway. The reservoir level was well below maximum, operators having drawn it down using another spillway that is also extensively damaged. The more than 180, 000 people downstream who were evacuated in response to fears of a flash flood are back home. But the episode was a reminder of the pressures on the major dams among the 1, 400 dams of various sizes in the state, where water levels are actively managed to control floods, make electricity, provide water for drinking, irrigation and recreation, and keep the dams and the people below them safe. After five years of severe drought in the state, in which water all but vanished from some reservoirs, this year is on pace to be one of the wettest on record. Dam operators follow specific rules on releasing water, set by state and federal regulators, which require leaving room for anticipated storms. This year that balancing act has been more delicate than usual. The rush of runoff that affected Oroville when a warm storm hit the Sierra Nevada, bringing more rain and less snow, exposed the need for proper maintenance throughout the water system, and the potentially high cost when things go wrong. Repairs at Oroville alone could run in the hundreds of millions of dollars. The pressure on dams and other parts of the system is expected to rise as global warming continues. Computer models suggest that climate change will exacerbate a trend toward extremes  —   very dry or very wet years. By producing more rain and less snow in the mountains, atmospheric warming will also alter the amounts and timing of the runoff that fills the reservoirs behind dams like Oroville. Operators may have to release more water earlier in the year. But critics say the system is not flexible enough. At dams, like Oroville, that generate electricity, the rules on water releases are set for several decades as part of licensing requirements of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, known as FERC. Even nonhydropower dams have rules that are based on more static conditions. “California’s dams must be adapted to address new risks from a changing climate,” Jeffrey Mount, a senior fellow at the Public Policy Institute of California, wrote in a blog post after the Oroville crisis. But, he added, “when it comes to changing course on dams, institutional inertia is a powerful countervailing force. ” A spokeswoman for FERC pointed out that the commission had the authority to reopen a hydropower license, and that the agency’s dam safety program reviewed rainfall and storm data every five years. But Dr. Viers and others say climate change has not been factored in. In 2009, for example, FERC rejected climate change studies in relicensing several hydropower projects in Northern California. John Andrew, the deputy director of the California Department of Water Resources  responsible for climate change issues, said the state had been studying the impact of warming for years. “We’re already looking at a changed hydrology,” he said. “And that’s going to continue to change. So how we operate dams as well as other water infrastructure is going to have to change. ” Mr. Andrew said a mix of conventional infrastructure like dams and alternative approaches  —   including floodplains but also technologies like desalination and wastewater recycling  —   should be used to manage the state’s water. “The bottom line is we would like to see a diverse set of strategies, implemented at a local and regional level,” he said. At the   Tract, after the levee was breached two weeks ago the Nature Conservancy made a cut at the opposite end to allow the river waters to flow through. When the wet season ends, the tract should drain and dry out, although there still may be occasional flooding in parts of it. A more deliberate experiment is taking place about a   miles to the east, at another conservancy plot on the Cosumnes River. Dr. Viers refers to the Cosumnes as the state’s “ugly duckling” river  —   it has never fit into   plans. As a result, unlike all the other significant rivers on the western slope of the Sierra, the Cosumnes is essentially undammed and flooding is largely uncontrolled. Farmers in the area have adapted, growing crops or raising orchards that can tolerate winter inundations. The flooding can be a nuisance nonetheless. For days at a time over the last month, Michael Eaton, a former official with the Nature Conservancy who has a small farm at his home in Galt, has had to leave his car on one side of a flooded driveway and paddle a canoe a couple of hundred feet to reach the property. “It gets a little tiresome,” said Mr. Eaton, who is thinking of having the road raised. At times, Mr. Eaton said, he can see and hear air bubbles popping up through the water as it infiltrates the soil. “It’s groundwater recharge in real time,” he said. The undammed nature of the Cosumnes also makes it a useful laboratory, both for studying how stream flows and flooding are changing under more natural conditions and for assessing the impact of green infrastructure. Not far from Mr. Eaton’s home, the conservancy bought a   plot along the river, called   punched a hole in a levee to turn it into a floodplain and planted native vegetation as part of the restoration effort. Dr. Viers and others have been studying the plot, and so far the results are encouraging. Among other things, they have measured a significant amount of water returning to aquifers. “This little ugly duckling is now showing us the way in which we can better manage rivers downstream,” Dr. Viers said.	1

226	IMAM KHOMEINI AIRPORT, Iran  —   When the United States wrestling team arrived at 3 a. m. on Saturday at an airport hotel outside Iran’s capital, Tehran, staff members ordered out for pizza. “We were all over the lobby, eating out of the boxes,” said Rich Bender, the executive director of Team USA. The wrestlers had just flown in from the western Iranian city of Kermanshah, where the team lost the Freestyle Wrestling World Cup to Iran, in a series of thrilling matches. At a time of increasing tension between the countries, how were the athletes received and what did they think about Iran? Kyle Snyder, an Olympic gold medalist, said his mother had been a bit worried when he told her he would travel to Iran. But he said the team was welcomed with nothing but friendliness. “They gave us roses at the airport, brought our bags, everyone wanted to take selfies with us,” Mr. Snyder said. “This was the best tournament I have ever participated in, even better than the Olympics in Rio. ” Later on Saturday, during a sightseeing trip, the wrestling team took to the landmark Milad Tower in Tehran, and excited Iranians took pictures of the team. Jordan Burroughs, an Olympic champion, said he has more fans in Iran’s capital “than from any other city. ” For a time, it had seemed the American wrestlers would be forced to stay home. After President Trump announced that Iran would be included in a travel ban, the country decided it would reciprocate by barring the team. But the Iranian authorities changed their minds after seeing numerous protests in the United States against the ban. Mr. Burroughs said that he was disappointed when he heard of the issues with the travel ban. “I don’t necessarily agree with all decisions by my government, and clearly not with this one,” he said of the   order barring travel by Iranians and citizens of six other predominantly Muslim countries to the United States. “I have never been affected by terror, but here in Iran, I have never felt any ill will toward me  —   the opposite actually. ” Iranian fans cheered the American wrestlers during matches against competitors from Azerbaijan, Russia and Georgia. “They were just screaming Jordan, Jordan, all the time,” said Bill Zadick, the team’s head coach, about Mr. Burroughs. “Jordan has defeated some of their heroes in key matches in the past, so they look up to him. ” Mr. Bender has accompanied the team on four trips to Iran. “We never had issues, as I recall,” he said. American wrestlers did not make their first trip back to Iran after the 1979 revolution until 1998. But since then, they have visited the country more than a dozen times. Wrestling can be a highly emotional sport, Mr. Bender said, but the athletes realize they are viewed as ambassadors of their country. “This is a highly competitive, mano a mano sport,” Mr. Bender said. “Sometimes people get poked in the eye. People can get angry. So we stress that here it is extra important to keep your posture, shake hands. Luckily, all the guys understand they represent the U. S. on and off the mat. ” Iran’s wrestling federation sent a former wrestler to the hotel to protect the team members in case someone might not be a fan. But there, as during the event in Kermanshah, all of the Iranians they met were all smiles. It was hard to believe, someone said, that Iran is  . “Is it true there is a mural in the city center that says ‘death to America’?” Mr. Bender wanted to know. “Because I haven’t noticed any of that. ”	1

Residents say he sticks to himself and described him as “odd.”Police responded after a man out of a nature hike happened to walk by Darwin’s house and saw Darwin having sex with the alligator in his backyard.The witness heard Darwin say, “next time you try to kill a man, you best get the job done.

Both of those charges stem from a case in Roselle involving a child between the ages of 13 and 17, court records show.Roselle police declined to talk about the animal cruelty charge because they said it’s part of the case with the child.  But a spokesman with the state’s attorney’s office confirmed Beckmann is accused of sexually abusing the peacock.When and how Phyl died is unclear. But Roselle police indicated they saw the bird’s body in the garage of Beckmann’s home on the night of April 28, according to court records.

858	 Regarding the article “American Psychological Association to Classify Belief in God As a Mental Illness” posted by the news nerd. I tried to see where they got their resources and tried to verify it in the APA website however I cannot find anything thus far.  According to the American Psychological Association (APA), a strong and passionate belief in a deity or higher power, to the point where it impairs one’s ability to make conscientious decisions about common sense matters, will now be classified as a mental illness.The controversial ruling comes after a 5-year study by the APA showed devoutly religious people often suffered from anxiety, emotional distress, hallucinations, and paranoia. The study stated that those who perceived God as punitive was directly related to their poorer health, while those who viewed God as benevolent did not suffer as many mental problems. The religious views of both groups often resulted in them being disconnected from reality.Dr. Lillian Andrews, professor of psychology, stated, “Every year thousands of people die after refusing life-saving treatment on religious grounds. Even when being told ‘you will die without this treatment’ patients reject the idea and believe that their God will still save them. Those lives could be saved simply by classifying those people as mentally unfit for decision making.” The stories posted on TheNewsNerd are for entertainment purposes only.

909	 Found this article posted on Facebook and after reading I suspect that the quoted material (supposedly spoken by Pat Robertson)is drastically paraphrased to elicit emotional response from opposing readers and NOT actual quotes from the man. – Pat Robertson: ‘I’m Not Sure Who or What to Blame Texas Flooding On’   Robertson told the press that unlike the 1995 Northridge earthquake and Hurricane Bonnie that hit Florida in 1998 — both natural disasters that the elder evangelical blamed on the regions impacted having embraced homosexuality in some way —  that he “can’t blame the Texas floods on the gays” since the Lone Star State is, according to Robertson, “the most stridently pro-Jesus and anti-gay state out there, by golly by gosh.” Despite his always knowing “just who to blame for all that ails the world,” Robertson says it could take him “a few days to figure out just how to pin the floods on the gays.” You know, in my day we didn’t have snot-nosed jerks going around using the words of the Bible against us. We were the outright authority on the Bible because we were the ones who traditionally got to control the Bible’s message. We were rich, elite men. That’s who has always controlled the Bible’s messages and themes … But that’s all besides the point. The point is that the gays are ruining everything, always bring about natural disasters, and the flooding in Texas is no exception.

77	NEW DELHI  —   Indian security forces in Kashmir engaged in an intense,    gun battle with militants that ended late Sunday morning, leaving four militants, two soldiers and one civilian dead, the authorities said. An additional civilian died after a protest. The police had learned that the militants were in a village, and cordoned it off late Saturday. They were conducting searches when they were fired upon by militants security forces began firing back. The violence then led to clashes between Indian security forces and large crowds of local youths who gathered to mourn the dead militants. The police used tear gas on protesters, who were pelting stones at the Indian forces. They also fired bullets and birdshot at protesters, injuring at least 21 people, one of whom later died, according to Dr. Abdul Majid, the medical superintendent of the district government hospital at Anantnag. The four militants, all residents of Kashmir and all in their 20s, were members of the rebel group Hizbul Mujahedeen, said Sridhar Patil, the police chief of Kulgam district. He said they had criminal charges, including murder and stealing arms from security forces, outstanding against them. “First we tried to convince them to surrender with the help of locals and family members,” Mr. Patil said, but they shouted back that they would not surrender. Security forces recovered three assault rifles and two pistols from the site, Mr. Patil said. Throngs of youths fought with Indian forces last summer in Kulgam. The disturbances began in July, when Indian security forces killed Burhan Wani, a top commander for Hizbul Mujahedeen. Sunday’s fight in Kulgam ended a lull of several months. Insurgents in Kashmir have been fighting for independence from India for nearly three decades, and the Indian authorities have long said that their movement is supported by Pakistan. Diplomatic ties between the two countries have frayed in recent years.	1
921	 And for the international order that we have worked for generations to build. Ordinary men and women are too small-minded to govern their own affairs, that order and progress can only come when individuals surrender their rights to an all-powerful sovereign. Leaders and dignitaries of the European Union; representatives of our NATO Alliance; distinguished guests:  We meet here at a moment of testing for Europe and the United States, and for the international order that we have worked for generations to build.Throughout human history, societies have grappled with fundamental questions of how to organize themselves, the proper relationship between the individual and the state, the best means to resolve inevitable conflicts between states.  And it was here in Europe, through centuries of struggle — through war and Enlightenment, repression and revolution — that a particular set of ideals began to emerge:  The belief that through conscience and free will, each of us has the right to live as we choose.  The belief that power is derived from the consent of the governed, and that laws and institutions should be established to protect that understanding.  And those ideas eventually inspired a band of colonialists across an ocean, and they wrote them into the founding documents that still guide America today, including the simple truth that all men — and women — are created equal.But those ideals have also been tested — here in Europe and around the world. Those ideals have often been threatened by an older, more traditional view of power. This alternative vision argues that ordinary men and women are too small-minded to govern their own affairs, that order and progress can only come when individuals surrender their rights to an all-powerful sovereign. Often, this alternative vision roots itself in the notion that by virtue of race or faith or ethnicity, some are inherently superior to others, and that individual identity must be defined by “us” versus “them,” or that national greatness must flow not by what a people stand for, but by what they are against.	0
135	GAZA CITY  —   Palestinians reacted with anger and bafflement on Wednesday after the Trump administration apparently backed away from insisting that having two states  —   one for Israelis, one for Palestinians  —   was the only viable solution to the   Middle East conflict. Saeb Erekat, chief negotiator for the Palestinians, raised the specter of “apartheid” and called for “concrete measures in order to save the   solution. ” A White House official, in remarks to reporters on the eve of President Trump’s meeting with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel on Wednesday, said the Trump administration would not push the   solution, an apparent retreat from decades of American policy. In his news conference with Mr. Netanyahu in Washington on Wednesday, Mr. Trump directly broke with diplomatic tradition on the issue by saying his concern was the “deal,” not whether that included a state for Palestinians. “I’m looking at two states and one state,” Mr. Trump said. “I like the one that both parties like. I can live with either one. ” Some Palestinians and Middle East experts reacted with alarm, saying that such a policy change would undercut the chances, already slim, of progress toward reconciliation between the two sides. “This is going to give Israel a free hand to do what it wants,” said Mosheer A. Amer, an associate professor at the Islamic University here in Gaza City. “At least Obama had some control over Netanyahu. ” Israel captured and occupied the West Bank and East Jerusalem 50 years ago, in 1967, and the status of the former Jordanian territories has been a source of conflict ever since. (So has the Gaza Strip, which had formerly been administered by Egypt.) Many Palestinian leaders, especially those in the West Bank, hold strongly that a   solution is the only acceptable resolution of the conflict. There is also considerable diplomatic weight behind the goal of having two viable states living in peace side by side. In December, with the Obama administration’s tacit support, the United Nations condemned Israeli settlements on occupied land as obstacles to the   solution. But lately the chances of achieving it have been dimming. Many Israelis and Palestinians have begun to doubt whether it is possible or even desirable. Many Israelis argue that the Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza are too divided among themselves to ever be able to permanently accept two states. Some in the Israeli right advocate annexing all or part of the West Bank, and some rightists warned Mr. Netanyahu not to raise the possibility of two states in his meeting with Mr. Trump. At the same time, many Palestinians say the line has already been crossed  —   that Israeli settlements have already eliminated the possibility of creating a contiguous Palestinian state. Instead, they advocate a single state encompassing both Israel and the occupied territories  —   a secular state where Palestinians and Israelis would live together with equal rights. At a news conference on Wednesday in the West Bank, Mr. Erekat said the only alternative to what he called Mr. Netanyahu’s “apartheid” vision was “one single secular and democratic state with equal rights for everyone, Christians, Muslims and Jews, on all of historic Palestine. ” That is opposed by many Israelis, who want Israel to remain a Jewish state. Some Israelis say that the deep divisions between the Palestinian factions that control the West Bank and Gaza are another reason that it will be impossible to reach an agreement on two states. The Fatah faction in the West Bank has tried to cooperate with the Israeli authorities on some levels, while Hamas, the group that has controlled Gaza since 2007, is more actively hostile to Israel. Hazim Kassim, a spokesman for Hamas, said on Wednesday, “What Trump said is new, but whatever he says, we in Hamas still believe that resistance is the only way to liberate our lands from the Israeli occupation. “It is now clear that the U. S. has provided a cover for aggression, occupation and the confiscation of Palestinian land,” he continued. “The U. S. is never serious when it comes to Palestinians’ human rights. ”	1
456	WASHINGTON  —   The speech was written, the rollout strategy was set. And then President Trump began talking and the plan went out the window. Unless that was the plan all along. When Mr. Trump sat down with television anchors at the White House for an    lunch on Tuesday, he was supposed to preview his first address to Congress. Instead, he suddenly opened the door to an immigration bill that would potentially let millions of undocumented immigrants stay in the country legally. Such legislation from the “build the wall” president would roil politics in the capital, and Mr. Trump told the anchors that nothing like that was actually in the speech as it was then drafted. But he turned to aides and suggested that maybe they should include it. After the lunch was over, aides rushed off to alert their colleagues, including Stephen K. Bannon and Stephen Miller, the architects of the president’s immigration crackdown. Once again, the unlikeliest of presidents had torn up the script and thrown his young administration into upheaval. Once again, Washington was left trying to fathom what his strategy was. Was it mad genius, an improvisational leader proposing a     move to overhaul immigration after making a point of deporting “bad hombres”? Or was it simply madness, an undisciplined political amateur unable to resist telling guests what he thinks they want to hear even at the expense of his own political base? In the end, he did not include it in the speech. And yet, rising to the occasion, Mr. Trump on Tuesday night sounded as presidential as he ever has since taking office. He invoked Abraham Lincoln and Dwight D. Eisenhower, heralded Black History Month, condemned   vandalism, celebrated American entrepreneurs like Alexander Graham Bell and Thomas Edison, and promised a “renewal of the American spirit. ” He followed the written text on the teleprompters more closely than any major speech of his presidency. Still, the paradox remained. He called for working “past the differences of party,” just hours after he called Representative Nancy Pelosi, the House Democratic leader from California, “incompetent. ” He declared that “the time for trivial fights is behind us” just weeks after engaging in a public Twitter war with Arnold Schwarzenegger over the ratings for “Celebrity Apprentice. ” And then there was that immigration trial balloon. If nothing else, Donald Trump the showman kept the attention right where he wanted it  —   squarely on himself. By the time he took the rostrum in the House chamber on Tuesday night for the functional equivalent of a State of the Union address, he had generated considerable suspense around what he would actually say and how it would be received. He boasted of deporting “gang members, drug dealers and criminals,” saying that “bad ones are going out as I speak. ” He introduced guests in the first lady’s box whose families had suffered at the hands of criminals in the country illegally. But he talked about “reforming our system of legal immigration,” saying as he has before that the United States should base its admission of foreigners on merit. “I believe that real and positive immigration reform is possible as long as we focus on the following goals,” he added, “to improve jobs and wages for Americans, to strengthen our nation’s security and to restore respect for our laws. ” Whether this was all an intentional distraction remained unclear by the time he wrapped up and headed back down Pennsylvania Avenue. This is, after all, a White House that revels in what its current occupants refer to as the “head fake,” where the president gives the impression of moving one way when he is really moving in a completely different direction, even diverting attention from one controversy by creating another. That leaves allies and adversaries alike scratching their heads about what Mr. Trump really believes. In private discussions since the inauguration, a mystified Senator Mitch McConnell, the Republican majority leader from Kentucky, has said that Mr. Trump appears uncertain of precisely where he stands on a number of critical issues. Thus, aides, activists, lobbyists and lawmakers search for ways to influence a malleable president, who sometimes plays along with his team’s desire to confuse and distract, but who is also prone to spouting out    ideas depending on his audience. Mr. Trump’s advisers have said privately that they wanted this opening speech to Congress to be more optimistic than the address he delivered at his inauguration in January, an   jeremiad against what he called “American carnage” and the establishment he blamed for it. Mr. Trump’s daughter Ivanka Trump has privately expressed concern about the harsh tone of some of her father’s rhetoric over many months. No president in modern times had shown up for his first speech to Congress with approval ratings so low  —   just 42 percent in the latest Gallup poll. His 40 days of careening from one crisis to another, many of them   had sowed deep doubts about his leadership not only among Democrats and independents but even among many Republicans. His challenge for this address was to move beyond these moments and establish himself as a president. Immigration has been one area where he was evidently still trying to calibrate. After all, Mr. Trump was not always so strident on the issue. After the 2012 election, he denounced Mitt Romney for supporting what he called “” calling it “a crazy policy” that cost Mr. Romney the Hispanic vote. The Democrats, he said then, did not have a policy “but what they did have going for them is they weren’t meanspirited about it. ” The session with the television anchors started out as a nod to tradition by a president who has broken so many. Like his predecessors on the day of a State of the Union address, Mr. Trump hosted the journalists for what was supposed to be an unrecorded lunch to give them a sense of what he would tell Congress. But the conversation took a surprising turn when some of the anchors asked about his efforts to deport many of the estimated 11 million immigrants in the country illegally. Without being prompted, Mr. Trump then raised the idea of legislation, noting that there had not been any comprehensive law passed by Congress on the subject since Ronald Reagan’s amnesty program in the 1980s. He told the anchors it was time for a bill that would grant legal status to many of those in the country illegally as long as both sides compromised, similar to the legislation sought but never passed by George W. Bush and Barack Obama. Mr. Trump said he recognized that it would cause him political problems with his conservative base voters, according to people in the room, but added that he thought he could keep them happy since they had stuck with him throughout last year’s Republican primaries. When Mr. Trump offered the idea, he let the word “compromise” hang in the air, gauging the reaction. He then turned to Hope Hicks, his director of strategic communications, and suggested that the thought could be added to his speech. As Mr. Trump’s words settled over the State Dining Room, the president’s aides glanced at one another. They moved quickly to alert Mr. Bannon and Mr. Miller, two of the main keepers of Mr. Trump’s address before Congress. That the proposal did not ultimately make it into the speech may speak to the influence of Mr. Bannon’s wing. But the town was confused and off balance, just the way Mr. Trump likes it.	1
227	Pledging to “make the Netherlands ours again,” the Dutch nationalist politician Geert Wilders, at a campaign event on Saturday, described Moroccan immigrants as “scum” who endanger the country’s citizens. “Not all are scum, but there is a lot of Moroccan scum in Holland who makes the streets unsafe,” Mr. Wilders told reporters in English at an event kicking off a parliamentary election campaign in the   town of Spijkenisse, outside Rotterdam. “If you want to regain your country, if you want to make the Netherlands for the people of the Netherlands, your own home, again, then you can only vote for one party,” Mr. Wilders, the leader of the Party for Freedom, said. Mr. Wilders, whose party leads in national polls, posted a video clip of his comments on Twitter. Mr. Wilders, who was convicted in December of inciting discrimination after leading an   chant at a political rally in 2014, has vowed to end Muslim immigration and shutter the country’s mosques if elected prime minister in a general election on March 15. His party has 12 of the 150 seats in the lower house of Parliament. But while ahead in the polls, Mr. Wilders’s lead is narrowing after recent gains by Prime Minister Mark Rutte, a   conservative. Even if his party places first in the election, questions remain about whether Mr. Wilders would be able to successfully form a governing coalition. Mr. Wilders is one of several European nationalist politicians who is appealing to disillusioned voters, embittered by immigration and economic inequality. If elected, Mr. Wilders has promised to remove the Netherlands from the European Union. The triumph of President Trump  —   whose   policies and   comments has been heralded by Mr. Wilders  —   and the successful campaign to extract Britain from the European Union have galvanized   parties and emboldened politicians across Europe.	1
67	SAN FRANCISCO  —   As soon as President Trump signed his executive order on immigration, some of the biggest tech companies went quiet. Their executives did not sign legal briefs, brandish statements or dissent on Twitter. They strove for business as usual. This was the older, stodgier, less glamorous part of the tech universe. These executives are generally not household names. Most of the companies have little presence in the excitable consumer marketplace. Some are government contractors. Their workers tend to be more settled, less tempted by cool  . Despite the companies’ sizable employment, the spotlight is not on them. Among these firms are IBM, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Qualcomm, Cisco, Dell and Oracle. When 127 companies signed an amicus brief last week in a Seattle court that said the executive order “violates the immigration laws and the Constitution,” none of these six firms were on the list. Yet even at some of these companies, there are stirrings of defiance. In a few   cases, workers have noisily quit. Many more have chosen to remain but are agitating for an explicit corporate morality even as Mr. Trump considers a new executive order on immigration. They want their companies to make clear not only what they support but also, perhaps even more important, what lines they will not cross. The activist push is being driven in significant measure by women, who are still fighting for their due in a   industry. But in an unlikely twist, the chief executives they are trying to influence at two major companies are female. At IBM, a petition has been circulating that proclaims, “We have a moral and business imperative to uphold the pillars of a free society by declining any projects which undermine liberty. ” The organizers say nearly 1, 000 verified employees have signed. This is a delicate subject for big tech companies, none more than Big Blue. Mr. Trump during the campaign explored the idea of a Muslim database, although his remarks were inconclusive. IBM’s   technology, as detailed by the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, was used by the Nazis in 1939 to do a census. That data, in turn, led directly to Adolf Eichmann’s Jewish Registry. At Oracle, the Silicon Valley database giant whose first customer was the Central Intelligence Agency, three young women  —   none of whom has worked there for more than a handful of months  —   started a petition last week to encourage the company to join the amicus brief. Hundreds of Oracle employees have signed it. “In some instances it is notable for a company to take a stand on an issue,” said one of the women, Irene Scher, a regional vice president of sales. “In this case, it’s notable not to have taken a stand. ” A   executive of Oracle, Safra Catz, and the chief executive of IBM, Virginia Rometty, became advisers to Mr. Trump during the transition. “I know that you are committed to help America’s economy grow in ways that are good for all its people,” Ms. Rometty wrote to him in November. Ms. Catz said in December, “We are with him and will help in any way we can. ” The three friends who created the Oracle petition joined the company in August, when it acquired the company they worked for, Opower. They emphasize they are not at odds with their employer. “This isn’t a criticism of Oracle,” said one of them, Rachel Kane, a sales executive at Oracle Utilities. “We’re giving them visibility into how individuals at the company feel. ” Oracle declined to comment. Both petitions echo the Never Again pledge, which nearly 3, 000 tech workers publicly committed to during eight days in December. Signers agreed not to participate in the creation of any government database that would target individuals based on race, religion or national origin. Five of the nine people listed on NeverAgain. tech as having worked to create the pledge, including the lead organizer, are women. Cauvery Patel, a corporate strategy associate at IBM, said she believed “workplaces have a responsibility to society  —   to the clients we serve, the employees we hire and the citizens who are impacted by our decisions. ” She said IBM had been “progressive” in encouraging women’s participation in technology and on other issues, but had not delivered on the immigration ban. “IBM’s decision not to actively stand up to the Trump administration and condemn this policy is extremely disturbing,” she said. At Hewlett Packard Enterprise, employees have been asking why it did not sign the amicus brief. Meg Whitman, the chief executive, responded Friday that “simply, we were not contacted to participate. ” She indicated the company would be taking a more assertive role: “You can expect to see us add our voice. ” Dell and Cisco declined to comment. Qualcomm did not respond to a request for comment. The internal debate at some of the big tech companies revolves around the question of engagement: Can you persuade more from the inside than the outside? The   position has been expressed by Elon Musk, the chief executive of Tesla and SpaceX and a member of the President’s Strategic and Policy Forum. In a handful of cases, people have said they are canceling new Teslas because they view him as working for the president. “Activists should be pushing for more moderates to advise President, not fewer,” Mr. Musk responded on Twitter. “How could having only extremists advise him possibly be good?” Mr. Musk said he had made sure that the travel ban was discussed “first and foremost” at a Feb. 3 White House meeting. A spokeswoman said no further details were available. The answer did not satisfy everyone. As one critic replied to Mr. Musk on Twitter: “You are not advising Trump, you are giving him cover and validating his nonsense. You can do more good by taking a stand. Please. ” IBM released a statement that said Ms. Rometty had “conveyed the company’s views directly to the president and the secretary of Homeland Security” on Feb. 3, “including suggestions for how technology can help to promote both national security and lawful immigration. ” Ed Barbini, vice president for corporate communications at IBM, said no further details were available. He noted that the company said in December that it would never participate in the building of a Muslim registry. He declined to comment on the petition. When a small group of IBM employees was drawing up the petition in November, it debated including a reference to the Nazis. IBM maintains that the accounts of its role in Hitler’s regime are overblown and incendiary. The employees decided to refer to the episode obliquely but focus on a more positive example  —   the company president Thomas J. Watson Jr. ’s Policy Letter No. 4, which resisted   policies in the South in the 1950s. “Watson sacrificed   business interests in order to be on the right side of history, something IBM takes pride in today,” the petition says. Daniel Hanley, one of the organizers, said the goal was “to build an organization inside the company that can hold IBM accountable to our values, and serve as a model for tech workers at other companies. ” George A. Polisner, who worked in cloud services at Oracle, took his stand in December. He posted a resignation letter on LinkedIn, saying that unlike Ms. Catz, he was not there to “help” Mr. Trump. “When his policies border on the unconstitutional, the criminal and the morally unjust,” he wrote, “I am here to oppose him in every possible and legal way. ” That was on a Monday. Mr. Polisner told his boss that he would work through Friday. After the letter became public, Mr. Polisner was fired immediately. At 56, he said, he probably would have worked at Oracle for a few more years if politics had not intervened. “There are different ways to influence,” Mr. Polisner said. “It’s a personal decision. I chose this one. ” Ms. Scher at Oracle and her friends chose another. “We all participated in the Women’s March,” she said. “I think it’s possible we’re feeling a heightened sense of civic responsibility. ”	1
899	 It is being reported on Facebook that the new US Navy ship, USS Gabrielle Gifford is going to be weaponless. I assume & hope that this is either satire or just plain false. Seeking to honor a retired congresswoman and 2011 shooting victim in the most considerate and respectful way possible, the Navy today christened the future USS Gabrielle Giffords (LCS-10), a first-of-its-kind, gun-free warship.Designed to hold a core crew of 40 sailors, the Independence-class littoral combat ship has been stripped bare of its Mk 110 57-millimeter gun, all four of its Mk2 .50-cal machine guns, its Evolved SeaRAM 11 cell missile launcher, and its entire cache of small arms, which are typically issued to boarding teams and watch standers.“Having this mighty warship be 100% gun-free not only helps to honor its heroic namesake, Gabby Giffords, but it also helps the Navy to steer clear of promoting a culture of violence,” said Secretary of the Navy Ray Mabus, who reportedly lobbied hard to get Congress and the Secretary of Defense on board with leaving the Navy’s newest addition to the fleet completely defenseless.

518	 A press conference was held last night by The Liberal Party of Canada, on behalf of newly-elected Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau about future marijuana laws and regulations.30 minutes into the conference, Trudeau announced the big news that all members of the parliament have agreed to — and that is pardoning all Canadian prisoners who have been convicted of a minor or major offence of marijuana. The Global Sun is a satire website, articles/post on the website are all made-up stories and should not be taken seriously. Canada’s Liberal Party government will introduce a law next spring to legalize recreational marijuana, Health Minister Jane Philpott disclosed last week at the United Nations. She did not detail who would be allowed to grow or distribute cannabis products.“Canada has a lot of options here,” said RAND Drug Policy Research Center co-director Beau Kilmer. “You have to pay attention to what’s going to happen with the regulation and the taxes. That could really shape what happens in terms of people coming in from other countries. You have to decide whether you want to allow that.”	0
385	FLAGSTAFF, Ariz.  —   The young boy was getting reacquainted with his father after an absence of six months and climbed on him as if he were a tree. The boy kissed his father and hugged him and clambered onto his shoulders. Then, when a protest video streamed on television, the boy grabbed a stick, and the lid of a pot to serve as a shield, and began to mimic a dance of dissent in the living room. There is much joy and relief, but also continued political complication, in the modest apartment of Feyisa Lilesa, the Ethiopian marathon runner who won a silver medal at the Rio Olympics and gained international attention when he crossed his arms above his head at the finish line in a defiant gesture against the East African nation’s repressive government. Afraid to return home, fearing he would be jailed, killed or no longer allowed to travel, Lilesa, 27, remained in Brazil after the Summer Games, then came to the United States in early September. He has received a green card as a permanent resident in a category for individuals of extraordinary ability in the sciences, arts, education, business and sports. On Valentine’s Day, his wife, Iftu Mulisa, 26 daughter, Soko, 5 and son, Sora, 3, were reunited with him, first in Miami and then in Flagstaff, where Lilesa is training at altitude for the London Marathon in April. Their immigrant visas are valid until July, but they also hope to receive green cards. “I’m relieved and very happy that my family is with me,” Lilesa said, speaking through an interpreter. “But I chose to be in exile. Since I left the situation has gotten much, much worse. My people are living in hell, dying every day. It gives me no rest. ” Lilesa’s Olympic protest was against Ethiopia’s treatment of his ethnic group, the Oromo people, who compose about a third of the country’s population of 102 million but are dominated politically by the Tigray ethnic group. Last month, Human Rights Watch reported that, in 2016, Ethiopian security forces “killed hundreds and detained tens of thousands” in the Oromia and Amhara regions progressively curtailed basic rights during a state of emergency and continued a “bloody crackdown against largely peaceful protesters” in disputes that have flared since November 2015 over land displacement, constitutional rights and political reform. The Ethiopian government has said that Lilesa could return home safely and would be considered a hero, but he does not believe this. He lists reasons for his suspicions, and they are personal: His    Tokkuma Mulisa, who is in his early 20s, has been imprisoned for about a year and reportedly tortured, and his health remains uncertain. His younger brother, Aduna, also a runner, was beaten and detained by the Ethiopian military in October. Aduna Lilesa, 22, said he was training in Burayu, outside the capital, Addis Ababa, on Oct. 16 when soldiers approached him. They hit him in the head with the butt of a rifle, kicked him and threatened to shoot him, he said, while demanding information about Feyisa. Fearing for his life, a gun pointed at him, Aduna said he lied and told the soldiers what he thought they wanted to hear about his brother: “He is a terrorist he is no good. ” Since the Olympics, Aduna said, his wife has been suspended from her job with Ethiopian government radio. He is living with Feyisa in Flagstaff until   when he will return home to his wife and young son. “It is not safe, but my family is there,” Aduna Lilesa said. “If I live here, they will be confused. ” Unease extends, too, to the Ethiopian running community. When Feyisa Lilesa runs the London Marathon, one of his primary challengers figures to be Kenenisa Bekele, a   Olympic champion on the track and a fellow Oromo who is considered by many the greatest distance runner of all time. The two runners were never close and tension between them increased last September in Berlin, where Bekele ran the   marathon time ever. Before that race, Bekele said in an interview with Canadian Running Magazine, speaking in English, which is not his first language, that “anyone have right to protest anything” but “you need to maybe choose how to protest and solve things. ” Asked specifically about Lilesa’s Olympic protest, Bekele said it was better to get an answer from him. Asked about other Ethiopian runners who have made similar   gestures, Bekele said that sport should be separate from politics, that everyone had a right to protest in Ethiopia and that the government was trying to “solve things in a democratic way. ” Bekele has received some criticism for not being more forceful in his remarks, and on social media in Ethiopia there is a split between supporters of the two runners. “Many people are being killed,” Lilesa said of Bekele. “How can you say that’s democratic? I’m very angry when he says that. ” His own social awareness, Lilesa said, began when he was a schoolboy, living on a farm in the Jaldu district, sometimes spelled Jeldu, west of Addis Ababa. Security forces used harsh tactics to break up student protests, he said, and sometimes his classmates simply disappeared. He belongs to a younger Oromo generation emboldened to resist what it considers to be marginalization by Ethiopia’s ruling party. “Before, people would run away they feared the government, the soldiers,” Lilesa said. “Today, fear has been defeated. People are standing their ground. They are fed up and feel they have nothing more to lose. ” When he was named to Ethiopia’s Olympic team last May, three months before the Summer Games, Lilesa felt it was urgent to make some kind of protest gesture in Rio de Janeiro. But he did not tell anyone of his plans. If he told his family, they might talk him out of it. If the government found out, he might be kicked off the Olympic team or worse. He continued to visit Oromo people detained in jail and to give money to Oromo students who had been dismissed from school and left homeless. He was wealthy for an Ethiopian, independent, and he sensed that the government monitored some of his movements. He worried that he could be injured or killed in a staged auto accident. Or that someone might ambush him when he was training in the forests around Addis Ababa. When the doorbell rang at his home, he went to the second floor and peered outside before answering. “I was really fearful,” Lilesa said. “Being an Oromo makes one suspect. ” On the final day of the Olympics, his moment came. As he reached the finish of the marathon, in second place behind Eliud Kipchoge of Kenya and ahead of Galen Rupp of the United States, Lilesa crossed his arms. It was a familiar Oromo gesture of protest and one that carried great risk, both to his career representing Ethiopia and to his family. “Giving up running for Ethiopia was the least I could do, because other people were giving up their lives,” Lilesa said. Iftu Mulisa, his wife, was watching at home in Addis Ababa with 15 or 20 relatives and friends. There was loud cheering and celebrating, and then Lilesa crossed his arms. The cheering was replaced by silence and confusion and fear. “Everyone was asking: ‘Does he come home? Does he stay? What happens next? ’” Mulisa said. “It was so shocking. He hadn’t told anyone. ” For two or three days, Lilesa said, he did not answer the phone when his wife called. “I had put them in this position and I just didn’t know what to say to her,” he said. Still, he felt he had made the right decision. “I needed to do this,” Lilesa said. “I thought of it this way: When a soldier enlists, you know the risks, but because you swore to defend the country or the law, you don’t think about the consequences. ” When he finally spoke to his wife, Lilesa said, he tried to calm her and tell her everything would be O. K. But the uncertainty was difficult. “He had never been gone more than a week or two,” Mulisa said. “Having young kids made it more difficult. They missed him and asked questions I couldn’t answer. But I was hopeful we would be reunited one day. ” In a diplomatic whirlwind, Lilesa secured an immigrant visa to the United States and eventually moved to Flagstaff, a training hub at nearly 7, 000 feet where athletes often go to enhance their   capacity. He was invited there by a runner from Eritrea, which neighbors Ethiopia. Even in the best of situations, distance running can be an isolating life of training twice a day and sleeping. Lilesa kept in touch with his family through video chats, but they were disrupted for a period when the Ethiopian government restricted internet access. In Ethiopia it is the traditional role of the wife or maid to prepare the food, to do the domestic chores. Without his family, Lilesa said, he sometimes ate only once or twice a day, too tired to cook dinner, hardly recommended for marathoners who routinely train more than 100 miles per week. “I had to fend for myself in a way I’ve never done in my life,” he said. Perhaps the most difficult moment, Lilesa said, came when he was still in Rio de Janeiro after the Games and learned of the death of a close friend, Kebede Fayissa. He had been arrested in August, Lilesa said, and was among more than 20 inmates to die in a fire in September under suspicious circumstances at Kilinto prison on the outskirts of Addis Ababa. Opposition figures have said that the bodies of some prisoners had bullet wounds. “I didn’t even know he had been arrested and there I was in Brazil, finding about his death on Facebook,” Lilesa said of Fayissa. “He had helped me so much at different times of my life. ” Eventually, Mulisa and their two children received immigrant visas to enter the United States and left Addis Ababa in   for Frankfurt, Germany, then Miami, where Lilesa greeted them at the airport. The scariest time, Mulisa said, came when she walked down the Jetway to the plane, afraid the Ethiopian government would prevent her from leaving at the last minute. Most likely, Lilesa said, his family was permitted to leave because to do otherwise would have generated negative publicity. In Miami, there was more emotion than words, Mulisa said, as the children hugged their father and she told him, “I didn’t think I would see you so soon. ” While he will surely not be chosen to compete for Ethiopia at the Olympics and world track and field championships while in exile, Lilesa can still make hundreds of thousands of dollars as an independent, elite marathon runner. Since the Olympics, he has run a marathon in Honolulu and a half marathon in Houston. A GoFundMe campaign for him and his family, started by supporters, raised more than $160, 000. The London Marathon is two months away. He now has a voice as strong as his legs. Lilesa has met with United States senators, addressed members of the European Parliament in Brussels, written an   essay in The Washington Post and spoken with numerous reporters, trying to spread the story of the Oromo people. If the political situation changes in Ethiopia, he said, he and his family will move home. He does not expect that to happen soon. In the meantime, he hopes that his wife and children will be permitted to make yearly trips there to visit relatives. For himself, he said he had no regrets. “This has given me more confidence, more reasons to try harder, more reasons to compete so that I can use this platform to raise awareness,” Lilesa said. “I’m constantly thinking, what else can I do?”	1
965	 A pedophile priest, who was found guilty of raping 30 children while infected with HIV but forgiven by the Vatican, has been found dead outside his church.Earlier this year, Catholic priest Jose Garcia Ataulfo admitted to raping 30 young girls aged between 5 and 10 years old in Oaxaca, Southern Mexico.Ataulfo was cleared of any wrong-doing by the church and didn’t face any criminal charges, despite the fact that he knew he was infected with HIV when he sexually abused all the children he is known to have raped. Ataulfo has admitted to sexually assaulting indigenous young girls from Oaxaca, a state isouthern Mexico known for its large indigenous population.The priest has yet to face any criminal charges, most likely due to the significant influence that the Catholic Church wields in Mexico, particularly in areas populated by indigenous ethnic groups. This supposed priest does not belong to the Archdiocese of Mexico – as Anonymous Mexico asserts – much less has he been let off, as the post irresponsibly and maliciously states.	0
116	Pedro Hernandez, a former bodega stock clerk who confessed to luring    Etan Patz into a basement and attacking him, was found guilty on Tuesday of murder and kidnapping, a   step toward closure in a case that bedeviled investigators for decades and changed forever the way parents watched over their children. A Manhattan jury convicted Mr. Hernandez on the ninth day of deliberations after the second of two lengthy trials that brought renewed attention to Etan’s disappearance on May 25, 1979, as he walked to his school bus stop alone in SoHo for the first time. The mystery of what happened to Etan shook New York and the nation, with photographs of the smiling,   boy ubiquitous on milk cartons, “missing” posters, newspaper front pages and television newscasts. The alarm caused by the abduction reverberated across America, evoking the worst fears of parents and helping to change the way the authorities tracked missing children. The vote to convict came after jurors returned to court Tuesday following a   weekend and watched  —   “for the 100th time,” one juror said  —   Mr. Hernandez’s recorded confessions. Around noon, the panel sent a note to the judge saying it had reached a verdict. Though jurors declined to discuss how their views had evolved while deliberating, they acknowledged overcoming significant divisions. “Deliberations were difficult,” said Tommy Hoscheid, the jury foreman, “but I think we had constructive conversations based in logic that were analytical and creative and adaptive and compassionate, and ultimately, kind of heartbreaking. ” Years of fruitless searches and examinations of suspects had failed to yield answers for Etan’s parents, Stanley and Julie Patz, who still live in the Prince Street loft that was their home when their son vanished from what was then a   area. The authorities turned their attention to Mr. Hernandez, who lived in a small New Jersey town near Philadelphia, after his    called detectives in 2012 to share his suspicion that he could be responsible. For Stanley Patz, the verdict meant a vigil of almost 38 years was close to an end. “The Patz family has waited a long time, but we finally found some measure of justice for our wonderful little boy Etan,” said Mr. Patz, who sat through every day of the trial, carrying his own cushion to use on the courtroom’s hard wooden benches. He said that he had called his wife, who was not at the courthouse, and that she had cried at the news. “I’m really grateful  —   I’m really grateful  —   this jury finally came back with what I’ve known for a long time,” he added, “that this man, Pedro Hernandez, is guilty of doing something really terrible so many years ago. ” The outcome was a victory for the Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus R. Vance Jr. who chose to prosecute Mr. Hernandez a second time after the earlier mistrial. That proceeding ended in 2015 after 18 days of deliberations when a lone juror declined to convict. He said he had been persuaded by defense arguments that Mr. Hernandez had mental health problems that called his admissions into question and that another suspect could have been the killer. “I’m relieved, and I’m relieved because I think it’s the right result,” Mr. Vance said in an interview. “I think it can bring all of us together in a moment of closure and healing,” he added, describing Etan’s disappearance as “something that has stayed with us as a city and as a community of New Yorkers. ” Mr. Hernandez, 56, is scheduled to be sentenced on Feb. 28. He faces up to 25 years to life in prison on both the kidnapping and murder charges, prosecutors said. Etan’s remains were never found, and prosecutors had no scientific evidence from crime scenes to corroborate their arguments. But the prosecution team, led by two veteran assistant district attorneys, Joan Illuzzi and Joel J. Seidemann, relied on Mr. Hernandez’s own words to build their case, pulling from the detailed confessions he gave to the authorities around the time of his arrest and to mental health experts who evaluated him later. In interviews recorded on video, which prosecutors played repeatedly for jurors during the   trial, Mr. Hernandez described encountering a boy on a sidewalk outside the bodega and asking him if he wanted a soda. Mr. Hernandez told investigators he had led the boy to the basement and started to choke him. He said he had put the boy into a plastic bag and put the bag into a box that he left with garbage nearby. He said he believed the child was still alive when he left him. As part of his confession, he also signed a “missing” poster showing Etan, confirming to investigators that he was the boy he had attacked. “I just couldn’t let go,” Mr. Hernandez said in one of the interviews. “I felt like something just took over me. ” He did not offer a motive and said that he had not sexually abused Etan or any other child. But in her closing arguments, Ms. Illuzzi argued otherwise, saying that sexual abuse was the probable reason for the attack. Mr. Hernandez’s lawyers tried to undermine the credibility of his confessions, saying he was the only witness against himself and an unreliable one at that. They described Mr. Hernandez as having a low I. Q. and a personality disorder that made it difficult for him to distinguish between reality and fantasy. The defense contended that Mr. Hernandez’s admissions reflected a fiction he had concocted. They also argued that he was susceptible to pressure by detectives during an interrogation that lasted several hours. Mr. Hernandez, who stared forward blankly through much of the trial, showed little emotion as the verdict was announced. “We are obviously terribly disappointed,” Harvey Fishbein, the lead defense lawyer, said outside court. He said he planned to appeal, saying the grounds to do so were “too lengthy to start to list right here. ” “We’re confident we’ll be back here some day,” Mr. Fishbein said. “Unfortunately, in the end, we don’t believe this will resolve the story of what happened to Etan back in 1979. ” Prosecutors sought to portray Mr. Hernandez as mercurial and controlling yet deeply religious and desperate to unburden himself of the guilt he felt for attacking Etan. To support that argument, the prosecution called witnesses who testified about  admissions Mr. Hernandez made over the years, with varying details, about killing a child in New York City. A member of a church group testified that Mr. Hernandez fell to his knees in tears, saying he had attacked a child. Mr. Hernandez’s former wife, with whom he has had an acrimonious relationship, recalled how he had pulled her aside before they married and told her he had killed a “muchacho,” which she inferred to be a teenage boy. She also testified that, after they were married, she found an image of Etan, taken from one of the missing posters, in a box of his in a closet. The first prosecution witness to testify when the trial began in October was Julie Patz. She recounted a hectic morning and what turned out to be her final moments with her son. It was the Friday before the Memorial Day weekend she was busy tending to her other children, and Etan jolted out of bed. He had been pushing to be more independent, she said, and he pleaded with her to let him walk about two blocks to the bus stop on his own. She said that she had reluctantly agreed and had walked him outside. He set off wearing an Eastern Airlines cap and carrying a $1 bill given to him by a neighborhood handyman on a visit to his workshop. He planned to stop in the bodega for a soda along the way. That afternoon, when Etan did not return, Ms. Patz testified, she called around and learned that he had never made it to school or boarded his bus. At the time, Mr. Hernandez was an    high school dropout who had recently come to New York from Camden, N. J. Prosecutors said that soon after Etan disappeared, possibly within days, Mr. Hernandez returned to New Jersey, at some point taking a job at a dress factory. His lawyers depicted Mr. Hernandez as struggling with a mental illness that loosened his grip on reality. They said he had schizotypal personality disorder, a condition marked by symptoms that included severe paranoia, social anxiety and unusual beliefs. His youngest daughter, Becky, testified that he had discussed having hallucinations of demons and an angelic woman in white. The defense also suggested that another man could have been the culprit. The man, Jose Ramos, a convicted pedophile, had a relationship with a woman who had been hired to walk Etan home from school. He was considered a suspect for years. Prosecutors, citing a lack of evidence, dismissed the suggestion that Mr. Ramos was involved. They also said Mr. Hernandez was feigning symptoms of his mental illness. At the start of deliberations, the jury was “majorly divided,” one juror, Cateryn Kiernan, said. The confessions and the testimony about Mr. Ramos were among the major points of discussion. “We all had different hangups,” Ms. Kiernan told reporters. “It’s not a    case. There’s a lot of gray. ” Ultimately, the jurors agreed with the prosecution’s arguments discrediting Mr. Ramos as a potential suspect, and found that the defense had not raised enough doubt. Another juror, Mike Castellon, called the defense strategy “spaghetti on the wall”  —   tossing out numerous theories, none of which stuck for him. Mr. Castellon said he found Mr. Hernandez’s confessions credible, and although he believed Mr. Hernandez might have a personality disorder, none of the experts who testified convinced him that it could make him confess to something he had invented. “That didn’t make him delusional,” Mr. Castellon said of the disorder. “We think he could tell right from wrong,” he said. “He could tell fantasy from reality. ”	1
867	 This is a very malicious article, that is mimicking NBC news. I believed the article, at first, and it was very upsetting, as it is supposedly involving Proctor, Vermont, which is near where I grew up.  The article states that Pastor Paul Horner was sentenced to one year in\ federal prison for refusing to marry a same-sex couple.     According to NBC News, a pastor at the Christian Proctor Church in Vermont, has been sentenced to one year in federal prison after refusing to marry gay couples. This comes shortly after the Supreme Court’s 5-4 decision ruling that states must allow gay-marriage.The Christian Pastor, 56-year-old Paul Horner, had his lawyer speak to reporters on his behalf.Steve Shand president of the Vermont Family Research Committee, said it is “open season on Americans who refuse to bow to the government’s redefinition of marriage.”“Homosexuals are gay,” Shand told reporters. “Why should Christian ministers be forced to perform and celebrate any marriage that conflicts with their beliefs? It’s a slippery slope my friend. Pretty soon these same pastors will be forced to wed animals or kitchen appliances. This is not my America!”	0
132	For the past few months, the sports media has been embroiled in a fight over “stick to sports. ” The phrase comes from a common online rebuke directed at sportswriters and pundits and players and coaches and anyone in the world of sports, really, who takes a political stance on anything that doesn’t occur on a field or a court or in a locker room or front office. The dividing line is predictable: Many jocks and traditionalists argue for a separation of church and state many young fans say that sports, just like everything else, is politics. But as the sports media critic Bryan Curtis has pointed out in The Ringer, the debate is mostly moot now: Trump’s presidency, with its daily explosions, has made it impossible to cover pro sports, even in the simplest   ways, without detouring onto the White House lawn. This comes, in part, from the way basic sports coverage works. Reporters ask questions before and after every game, and when the only thing anyone wants to talk about is Trump, some of those questions will be about the president. In the past, a paradoxical yet symbiotic relationship generally characterized whatever relationship existed between sports and politics. The big American leagues, especially the N. F. L. and Major League Baseball, gave every indication of wanting to distance themselves from partisan frictions. They typically prefer to honor troops, fly fighter jets over stadiums and hold moments of silence to honor the victims of tragedies. When they tackle overtly political issues, it’s through selective editing and legacy building. The settled politics of the past, where details can be kept few and the tone nostalgic, are fine. We know, for example, that Jackie Robinson broke baseball’s color line, stole home and wore 42 on his back. Muhammad Ali championed equality and said some funny stuff to Howard Cosell. Billie Jean King beat Bobby Riggs. Their lionization reassures us that the stands they took were good  —   and can now be consigned to bygone eras. But the latest intrusion of political talk into sports  —   whether you deem it excessive or welcome  —   has had a drastic effect on coverage. It has brought with it a currency and immediacy that we haven’t seen since the ’60s and early ’70s, when athletes like Jim Brown, Kareem   and Curt Flood openly talked about civil rights. The day the White House declared its immigration and travel ban in January, the Milwaukee Bucks played the Toronto Raptors in Canada, and there was some concern that the Bucks’ rookie center, Thon Maker, would not be let back into the United States after the game: Maker is a citizen of Australia, but his family emigrated there from Sudan. The day after the game, Alex Lasry, a Bucks executive and the son of one of the team’s owners, tweeted: “I appreciate all the fans’ concerns and prayers for Thon. And today a Sudanese refugee who fled oppression and is an incredible young man will make his second N. B. A. start. I’m incredibly excited and proud of him. He’s a symbol of what makes America great and all immigrants believe about America. ” Maker was directly affected by Trump’s policies (though he   the United States without problem) and his teammates, fellow players and coaches in the N. B. A. publicized their support. This was not surprising, given the N. B. A. ’s wealth of international players and its cosmopolitan fan base in recent years, the league has encouraged its stars to speak out on matters important to them. More unexpected was the Super Bowl’s inability to avoid the fray. During this year’s   media day, usually a hollow parading of the players before the microphones and cameras, Tom Brady’s continued refusal to talk about his presidential friend was big news. Brady had been ignoring these questions for almost a year and a half now, ever since reporters saw a red “Make America Great Again” hat in his locker, but he finally gave in. All he could muster was: “What’s going on in the world? I haven’t paid much attention. I’m just a positive person. ” Brady’s   elisions were hardly surprising  —   he, perhaps more than any athlete since Tiger Woods, has doggedly confronted us with his right to never publicly say anything interesting to anyone. But the fact that his act hasn’t quite kept the inquisitors at bay suggests that the days of Woods, Derek Jeter and Michael Jordan just grinning through any edgy conversation are over, at least for now. Athletes, especially famous ones, are less likely to be left to stand alone as ciphers of sporting excellence. Their images will be shaded by their politics, even if these have to be assigned to them. And as players continue to be asked about their political beliefs by reporters  —   especially as the international players in basketball and baseball are prompted to talk about immigration  —   they have an opportunity to give voice to resistance. If they want a model, they should look toward the W. N. B. A. whose players have been exemplifying thoughtful political expression. Last summer, the W. N. B. A. fined several players for wearing black   in support of Black Lives Matter at pregame practices following the next game after the fine was announced, some players refused to discuss basketball, instead using the postgame news conference to talk about police shootings. (The W. N. B. A. rescinded the fines soon after.) Last month, Breanna Stewart, the league’s reigning Rookie of the Year, attended the airport protest at LAX. Stephen Curry, arguably the world’s most popular basketball player, may be following the W. N. B. A. lead. After the chief executive of Under Armour recently referred to Trump as a “great asset” for the country, Curry, whose endorsement deal with the company runs through 2024, said, “There is no amount of money, there is no platform I wouldn’t jump off, if it wasn’t in line with who I am. ” Perhaps more than any other N. B. A. star lately, Curry has tended to project a charming blandness, but in putting his sponsorships and money at risk  —   however improbable the prospect of his losing any  —   he went further than most outspoken athletes. In the week following the Super Bowl, at least six Patriots players  —   including Martellus Bennett and Devin McCourty, who earlier in the season raised fists in solidarity with Colin Kaepernick’s   protest  —   said they would not make the traditional victory visit to the White House. (Brady went to Washington after his first three championships, when George W. Bush was president, but skipped the fourth trip during the Obama presidency.) “I was a black man yesterday, and I’m going to be a black man tomorrow,” Bennett tweeted in response to the predictable storm his announcement kicked up from the “stick to sports” crowd. “My wife and daughter are women today and will be women tomorrow. ” The Patriots absent from the White House photo op will be the most conspicuous part of what usually is a goofy, perfunctory moment in the N. F. L. ’s   and reporters will reach out to them for comment, which will provide another occasion for criticism. Those athletes who do speak out might find a curiously receptive ear in the White House. Let’s remember that Trump, perhaps even more than his   predecessor, is a sports fan. He owned a team in the United States Football League (while almost   running the league into the ground) he hosted fights at his Atlantic City casinos he tried to buy the Buffalo Bills he brags about his friendship with Brady. Above all, he has shown a crippling sensitivity to the opinions of his fellow celebrities. Professional sports usually provides a poor, inaccurate reflection of politics, but sometimes elements of that imagery  —   the machismo, the posturing, the adoration of stars  —   align exactly. Jocks, if nothing else, know how to get the president’s attention.	1
1000	 Basically more eyeballs are now on mobile devices than on TVs and newspapers, and when those eyeballs are on phones, they’re often looking at social media and at content generated by both people and companies. The Kardashians [for example] have amassed millions of people that not only follow what they do but try and replicate what they do. So when they post a product of say, skin cream or make-up and say “this works,” people buy it. Some brands have found that’s more effective than standard advertising. If a person gets paid or gets a product for free and endorses it, they need to disclose that, otherwise they are misleading the consumer. A lot of people have gotten into hot water with the FTC because they’ve been busted for not complying. An influencer has a responsibility to disclose to their audience if they get paid or not — it‘s really influencer’s responsibility. It comes back down to the fact that Facebook from the beginning was set up and sells their services as a place where you can reach real people, where they put all their data, have all their conversations, where their offline networks are. We need to rethink how we deal with this, because this is not a small problem. It’s going to get worse, because the behavioral targeting is getting better and better with the goal being to cause measurable changes in behavior. You can’t just wash your hands, close your campaign down, or cash your checks and do your accounting and walk away. Society still has these things echo through it. These things keep recirculating. The amazing thing about the URL is that it allows you to look at the domains, and domains have credibility signals in them. With Facebook links, everything is embedded, and it removes all of those.When you post a story that looks like ABC.com, but it’s really ABC.com.co, older people or people that are busy, they don’t see the difference, so it’s super easy to hack those credibility signals when you paste links that Facebook nowadays automatically previews and converts. It removes all the credibility signals, and people can exploit that. Mr. Jackson does not have an exclusive contract with any digital agencies. The content was not approved, once brought to his attention all has since been removed. Our business is entirely different from this — we’ve had good partnerships with our clients and Facebook by increasing traffic to reputable publishers via celebrity pages, but none of these crazy sites. We have exclusive access to 50 cent, Martin Lawrence and LMFAO (amongst others) Facebook channels for our clients.…[Crossford] manages the accounts, we just have access to negotiating more affordable rates. [Crossford] again distributes the content. I think it’s going to get snuffed out [by Facebook], and there’s going to be a flight to quality for brands. There’s a lot going on right now in that space — it’s not regulated, there’s no association tracking or validating it — and it’s ripe for fraud. 	0
306	I spent last week ignoring President Trump. Although I am ordinarily a politics junkie, I didn’t read, watch or listen to a single story about anything having to do with our 45th president. What I missed, by many accounts, was one of the strangest and most unpredictable weeks of news in modern political history. Among other things, there was the resignation of the national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn, and an “Oprah Winfrey Show” tape that led to the downfall of the nominee for secretary of labor, Andrew F. Puzder. It wasn’t my aim to stick my head in the sand. I did not quit the news. Instead, I spent as much time as I normally do online (all my waking hours) but shifted most of my energy to looking for   zones. My point: I wanted to see what I could learn about the modern news media by looking at how thoroughly Mr. Trump had subsumed it. In one way, my experiment failed: I could find almost no   part of the press. But as the week wore on, I discovered several truths about our digital media ecosystem. Coverage of Mr. Trump may eclipse that of any single human being ever. The reasons have as much to do with him as the way social media amplifies every big story until it swallows the world. And as important as covering the president may be, I began to wonder if we were overdosing on Trump news, to the exclusion of everything else. The new president doesn’t simply dominate national and political news. During my week of attempted Trump abstinence, I noticed something deeper: He has taken up semipermanent residence on every outlet of any kind, political or not. He is no longer just the message. In many cases, he has become the medium, the ether through which all other stories flow. Obviously, just about every corner of the news was a minefield, but it was my intention to keep informed while avoiding Mr. Trump. I still consulted major news sites, but avoided sections that tend to be   and averted my eyes as I scrolled for   news. I spent more time on international news sites like the BBC, and searched for   sites covering topics like science and finance. I consulted social news sites like Digg and Reddit, and occasionally checked Twitter and Facebook, but I often had to furiously scroll past all of the Trump posts. (Some news was unavoidable when Mr. Flynn resigned, a journalist friend texted me about it.) Even when I found   news, though, much of it was interleaved with Trump news, so the overall effect was something like trying to bite into a    cake without getting any fruit or nuts. It wasn’t just news. Mr. Trump’s presence looms over much more. There he is off in the wings of “The Bachelor” and even “The Big Bang Theory,” whose creator, Chuck Lorre, has taken to inserting   messages in the closing credits. Want to watch an awards show? Say the Grammys or the Golden Globes? Trump Trump Trump. How about sports? Yeah, no. The president’s policies are an animating force in the N. B. A. He was the subtext of the Super Bowl: both the game and the commercials, and maybe even the halftime show. Where else could I go? Snapchat and Instagram were relatively safe, but the president still popped up. Even Amazon. com suggested I consider Trump toilet paper for my wife’s Valentine’s Day present. (I bought her jewelry.) All presidents are omnipresent. But it is likely that no living person in history has ever been as famous as Mr. Trump is right now. It’s possible that not even the most famous or infamous people of the recent or distant past  —   say, Barack Obama, Osama bin Laden, Bill Clinton, Richard Nixon, Michael Jackson, Muhammad Ali or Adolf Hitler  —   dominated media as thoroughly at their peak as Mr. Trump does now. I’m hedging because there isn’t data to directly verify this declaration. (Of course, there are no media analytics to measure how many outlets were covering Hitler the day he invaded Poland.) But there is some pretty good circumstantial evidence. Consider data from mediaQuant, a firm that measures “earned media,” which is all coverage that isn’t paid advertising. To calculate a dollar value of earned media, it first counts every mention of a particular brand or personality in just about any outlet, from blogs to Twitter to the evening news to The New York Times. Then it estimates how much the mentions would cost if someone were to pay for them as advertising. In January, Mr. Trump broke mediaQuant’s records. In a single month, he received $817 million in coverage, higher than any single person has ever received in the four years that mediaQuant has been analyzing the media, according to Paul Senatori, the company’s chief analytics officer. For much of the past four years, Mr. Obama’s monthly earned media value hovered around $200 million to $500 million. The highest that Hillary Clinton got during the presidential campaign was $430 million, in July. It’s not just that Mr. Trump’s coverage beats anyone else’s. He is now beating pretty much everyone else put together. Mr. Senatori recently added up the coverage value of 1, 000 of the world’s best known figures, excluding Mr. Obama and Mr. Trump. The list includes Mrs. Clinton, who in January got $200 million in coverage, Tom Brady ($38 million) Kim Kardashian ($36 million) and Vladimir V. Putin ($30 million) all the way down to the 1, 000th   celebrity in mediaQuant’s database, the actress Madeleine Stowe ($1, 001). The coverage those 1, 000 people garnered last month totaled $721 million. In other words, Mr. Trump gets about $100 million more in coverage than the next 1, 000 famous people put together. And he is on track to match or beat his January record in February, according to Mr. Senatori’s preliminary figures. How do we know Mr. Trump is more talked about than anyone else in the past? There are now more people on the planet who are more connected than ever before. Facebook estimates that about 3. 2 billion people have internet connections. On average, the people of Earth spend about eight hours a day consuming media, according to the marketing research firm Zenith. So almost by definition, anyone who dominates today’s media is going to be read about, talked about and watched by more people than ever before. “From a media perspective, it’s pretty clear,” Mr. Senatori said. “The sheer volume, and the sheer amount of consumption, and all the new channels that are available today show that, yeah, he’s off the charts. ” Mr. Trump is a historically unusual president, and thus deserves plenty of coverage. Yet there’s an argument that our   modern media ecosystem is amplifying his presence even beyond what’s called for. On most days, Mr. Trump is 90 percent of the news on my Twitter and Facebook feeds, and probably yours, too. But he’s not 90 percent of what’s important in the world. During my break from Trump news, I found rich coverage veins that aren’t getting social play. ISIS is retreating across Iraq and Syria. Brazil seems on the verge of chaos. A large ice shelf in Antarctica is close to full break. Scientists may have discovered a new continent submerged under the ocean near Australia. There’s a reason you aren’t seeing these stories splashed across the news. Unlike   media, today’s media works according to social feedback loops. Every story that shows any signs of life on Facebook or Twitter is copied endlessly by every outlet, becoming unavoidable. Scholars have long predicted that social media might alter how we choose cultural products. In 2006, Duncan Watts, a researcher at Microsoft who studies social networks, and two colleagues published a study arguing that social signals create a kind of “inequality” in how we choose media. The researchers demonstrated this with an online market for music downloads. Half of the people who arrived at Mr. Watts’s   site were shown just the titles and band name of each song. The other half were also shown a social signal  —   how many times each song had been downloaded by other users. Mr. Watts and his colleagues found that adding social signals changed the music people were interested in. Inequality went up: When people could see what others were downloading, popular songs became far more popular, and unpopular songs far less popular. Social signals also created a greater unpredictability of outcomes when people could see how others had picked songs, the collective ratings of each song were less likely to predict success, and bad songs were more likely to become popular. I suspect we are seeing something like this effect playing out with Trump news. It’s not that coverage of the new administration is unimportant. It clearly is. But social signals  —   likes, retweets and more  —   are amplifying it. Every new story prompts outrage, which puts the stories higher in your feed, which prompts more coverage, which encourages more talk, and on and on. We saw this effect before Mr. Trump came on the scene  —   it’s why you know about Cecil the lion and Harambe the gorilla  —   but he has accelerated the trend. He is the Harambe of politics, the undisputed king of all media. It’s only been a month since Mr. Trump took office, and already the deluge of news has been overwhelming. Everyone  —   reporters, producers, anchors, protesters, people in the administration and consumers of news  —   has been amped up to 11. For now, this might be all right. It’s important to pay attention to the federal government when big things are happening. But Mr. Trump is likely to be president for at least the next four years. And it’s probably not a good idea for just about all of our news to be focused on a single subject for that long. In previous media eras, the news was able to find a sensible balance even when huge events were preoccupying the world. Newspapers from World War I and II were filled with stories far afield from the war. Today’s newspapers are also full of   articles, but many of us aren’t reading newspapers anymore. We’re reading Facebook and watching cable, and there, Mr. Trump is all anyone talks about, to the exclusion of almost all else. There’s no easy way out of this fix. But as big as Mr. Trump is, he’s not everything  —   and it’d be nice to find a way for the media ecosystem to recognize that.	1

229	The world’s grocery carts could soon be filled with more and more products from one global colossus. Food, beverage and   companies have been seeking merger partners to obtain greater scale and efficiencies as consumers, particularly younger shoppers, eschew the boxed and jarred foods of their parents’ generation. Now, one such recently merged giant, Kraft Heinz, has set its sights on the biggest target to date: Unilever, the home of Dove soap and Axe body spray, Ben  Jerry’s ice cream and Hellmann’s mayonnaise. Kraft Heinz disclosed on Friday that it had made a $143 billion takeover offer for Unilever. If completed, it would be the largest   merger since the British wireless provider Vodafone’s $183 billion acquisition of Mannesmann of Germany in 2000. Unilever said it had spurned the offer, which it said “fundamentally undervalues” the   company. Still, that is not expected to end the matter. Pressed by growing competition from upstarts and changing consumer habits, food and   giants will have little choice but to seek deals. And 3G Capital, the Brazilian investment firm that bought Heinz, then Kraft just two years ago, has the resources and the good will of Wall Street to continue to pursue Unilever. It also has the support of Warren E. Buffett, who has previously collaborated with 3G and is expected to provide financing in any deal with Unilever. A combination of Kraft Heinz and Unilever would create an empire of hundreds of household names, with more than $82 billion in sales. Kraft Heinz’s geographic strength in North American   sales would complement Unilever’s stronger sales in Europe, Latin America, the Middle East and parts of Asia. Kraft Heinz executives have “said they really want to develop and have an international platform for those Kraft Heinz brands,” said Brittany Weissman, an analyst with Edward Jones in St. Louis. “I think Unilever would give them that international platform to get those brands out overseas. ” But a merger would be certain to draw antitrust reviews by regulators from many countries. “Market power would be much increased, as the major supermarkets would have little choice but to buy from the merged business,” John Colley, a professor of practice in strategy and leadership at Warwick Business School in Coventry, England. Kraft Heinz approached Unilever about a potential deal in the last few weeks, according to people briefed on the matter, who were not authorized to speak publicly about the negotiations. Among its pitches, these people said, was that the combined company would maintain headquarters in the United States, Britain and the Netherlands. That could prove important amid rising nationalist sentiment, given Britain’s vote to leave the European Union and an election approaching in the Netherlands. Kraft Heinz, with 3G behind the wheel, has long been considered the most likely to drive a wave of consolidation in the food industry. Friday’s disclosure followed speculation late last year that Kraft Heinz might make an offer for Mondelez International, the maker of Oreos and Ritz crackers Shares of Mondelez, and those of companies like General Mills and Campbell Soup that had been seen as potential targets, fell on Friday in part because of disappointment over news of the Unilever bid. Shares of Kraft Heinz surged nearly 11 percent. The Brazilian principals of 3G have led a buying spree over two decades to become a global force in food and beverages. In doing so, they have won the admiration of no less a business eminence than Mr. Buffett. They took a small Brazilian brewing company and eventually transformed it into   InBev, the   gorilla of beer. They moved into fast food by buying Burger King, then merging it with Tim Hortons, Canada’s foremost purveyor of coffee and doughnuts. And with Mr. Buffett’s help, they bought Heinz in 2013, transforming a staid American ketchup legend into a lean maker of condiments and canned soups. Two years later, in 2015, they bought Kraft to become even bigger. Now  —   almost two years after the Kraft deal  —   3G and Kraft Heinz are casting their eyes on Unilever, which is the   seller of packaged food worldwide and the     maker behind Procter  Gamble. Unilever, which is based in London and Rotterdam, the Netherlands, has embraced sustainability measures aimed at reducing the company’s environmental impact and improving customers’ health. It has also moved to update its products with younger, hipper names by buying   like Dollar Shave Club and the cleaning products maker Seventh Generation. And the company has built an important presence in developing countries, which now account for some 58 percent of its revenue. Still, Unilever has been weighed down by slowing sales in the last year, prompting some analysts to call for additional cost cuts. Combining with Kraft Heinz would leave the company in the hands of masters of   who have won praise from Mr. Buffett. At Burger King, for example,   executives disposed of luxurious corporate offices, the corporate jet and even workers’ personal printers. At Kraft Heinz, that approach has helped lead to profit margins of about 30 percent, compared with roughly 15 percent at Unilever. Unilever said that Kraft Heinz’s bid was valued at roughly $50 a share, for an 18 percent premium to the target company’s closing price on Thursday. The offer consists of $30. 23 a share in cash and 0. 222 in shares in the combined company. Under British takeover rules, Kraft would have until March 17 to announce its firm intention to make an offer for Unilever or it would have to walk away. Shares of Unilever jumped in Friday trading in London after The Financial Times’s Alphaville blog reported the offer. A deal for Unilever would be expensive by any measure, particularly because Kraft Heinz already has nearly $30 billion in   debt on its books. But Kraft Heinz has argued in private that it has healthy cash flows that could easily service the additional debt that would help finance the bid. Potentially further bolstering Kraft Heinz’s firepower is Mr. Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway, which helped finance 3G’s $23 billion purchase of Heinz and its merger with Kraft. Some analysts, however, were cautious on the prospects of a Unilever sale. Raphael Moreau, an analyst with Euromonitor in London, said that Unilever might ultimately be willing to pursue a smaller deal with Kraft to offload some of its food brands. “While creating synergies in sauces and soups could be a rationale for such a deal, a combination of Heinz and Hellmann’s in mayonnaise could struggle to be given approval by competition authorities,” Mr. Moreau said. And some British lawmakers have already criticized Kraft Heinz’s approach, pointing to Brexit and the decline in the pound as paving the way for “fire sales” of British companies. The chairman of Parliament’s business committee, Iain Wright, said on Friday that “a lot of very good British companies will be subject to fire sales without taking into account their performance and quality. ”	1
40	Charles Oakley has strong feelings about comped tickets. They are not freebies, he said in a recent interview. Instead, they are the vehicle through which teams show respect for former players. The Knicks have not offered Oakley free tickets for a long time. Worse, Oakley said, is the feeling that the organization has been scrubbing him from its history. This season, for example, the Knicks are celebrating their 70th anniversary, and Oakley has not been invited to participate in any of the events. It seems unlikely that any of that will change now. Mounting losses and a dysfunctional relationship between Carmelo Anthony and the team’s president, Phil Jackson, are no longer enough for the Knicks. On Wednesday night, a franchise with an addiction to needless drama raised the bar when Oakley, one of the franchise’s most beloved former players, was removed from Madison Square Garden in handcuffs after a fracas involving security personnel. If the episode was the product of years of festering animosity between Oakley and James L. Dolan, the team’s owner, then the fallout was swift, with the public and a number of prominent N. B. A. players quickly siding with Oakley. He was charged with three counts of   assault and one count of criminal trespass, all misdemeanors, and came out of the encounter more revered than ever among the team’s many frustrated fans. Even before the Knicks wrapped up their   loss to the Los Angeles Clippers on Wednesday night, the hashtag #FreeOakley began to circulate on social media. A police officer at the Manhattan precinct where Oakley was being processed stood on the steps and shouted, “Free Charles Oakley!” Passing motorists rolled down their windows and complained about how he had been treated. Several N. B. A. stars were quick to express their support for Oakley on social media. The Clippers’ Chris Paul, who was not at Wednesday’s game because of a thumb injury, bristled at the Knicks’ statement on Wednesday night that Oakley needed some sort of help, and Paul described him as “the realest person our league has seen. ” The Chicago Bulls’ Dwyane Wade and the Cleveland Cavaliers’ LeBron James posted photographs of Oakley from his playing days with the Knicks on their Instagram accounts. James called him a legend. And Reggie Miller, a former star with the Indiana Pacers and a player who had legendary playoff duels with Oakley’s Knicks in the 1990s, weighed in on Twitter with vehement criticism of the franchise. He questioned why any N. B. A. free agent would want to sign with the Knicks and “play for an owner who treats the past greats like this or a president who stabs star player in the back?” The latter part of the tweet was, of course, a reference to Jackson, whose efforts to force Anthony out of New York have been overshadowed by the Oakley episode  —   at least for the moment. The Knicks are, by any objective measure, a mess, and Miller may be right that they are taking on a toxic reputation around the league. The Knicks are even making the Nets, with their     record, look like the most stable basketball organization in New York City. Less clear, though, is what actually occurred Wednesday night that resulted in Oakley’s ejection. At the start of the game, Oakley was sitting with several friends, and they were not far from Dolan’s usual seat, which is in the front row in the corner of the court. Accounts of Oakley’s behavior at that point vary widely, with some fans saying they didn’t hear or see Oakley saying or doing anything inappropriate, or trying to provoke Dolan, and others suggesting he seemed somewhat combative. In any case, when security guards approached Oakley, he clearly became angry, unleashing a string of profanities and becoming physical with at least two of them. As he was then removed from the arena, the crowd chanted his name, a moment that may come to symbolize an increasingly disastrous season. Shortly after the encounter, the Knicks issued a statement that ended with the hope that Oakley would get “some help,’’ a suggestion that offended many people in addition to Paul. On Thursday, the Knicks issued a   statement in which they more explicitly stated that numerous Garden employees and New York City police officers had witnessed “abusive behavior’’ by Oakley as the episode unfolded. It dismissed his contention that he had done nothing wrong as “pure fiction. ’’ Madison Square Garden officials provided one employee’s description of the encounter to The New York Times, identifying her as a woman who was an “order taker’’ in the section in which Oakley was sitting. According to the statement by the woman, whom the Garden did not name, Oakley was agitated when he sat down, asking where Dolan was and why security guards were looking at him. She said she urged him to calm down, to no avail. Oakley played for the Knicks for 10 seasons and through much of the 1990s, when the Knicks were a tough, competitive team and Oakley’s determined physical presence near the basket epitomized everything the Knicks were about. Dolan did not become the chairman of the Garden until Oakley had already left the Knicks. Nevertheless, the two men have managed to become adversaries in the years that followed. In a recent interview, Oakley said that he tried to approach Dolan at the 2014 N. B. A.   Game in New Orleans but was rebuffed. Dolan, he said, refused to shake his hand. Oakley said that he was later told that he had said “something in the paper” that had infuriated Dolan. Oakley said he had no idea what he said to offend Dolan. Oakley has been a vocal critic of the team  —   and of Dolan, in particular  —   for years. His insistence that he does not know why the team treats him so poorly is, at the very least, disingenuous. He has been miffed that the Knicks did not offer him a coaching position. He has cursed Dolan through the news media, largely for Dolan’s refusal to meet with him. And he has continued to channel many fans’ frustrations by venting about the team’s poor play. Oakley is no stranger to confrontation. As a player, he once punched Charles Barkley in the face during a preseason game. He was the consummate enforcer in an era of physical play. It has become clear, through some of his actions in retirement, that his approach to the game was really who he is. And that has caused some problems. In 2010, he was involved in a scuffle at a Las Vegas casino that left him with a broken arm. More recently, after Game 7 of last season’s N. B. A. finals, Oakley screamed at security personnel in Oakland, Calif. who were trying to prevent him (with varying degrees of success) from entering the Cavaliers’ jubilant locker room. The Cavaliers had just won their first championship after defeating the Golden State Warriors, and Oakley, who grew up in Cleveland, wanted to join the celebration. “They was just mad they lost,” Oakley said in a recent interview, referring to the Warriors. Friends describe Oakley as loyal, generous and protective. But he is also sensitive to slights, perceived and real. Over lunch with this writer in November, he reflected on his playing days with the Knicks and lamented how the team, he thought, had refused to market anyone except Patrick Ewing. “They probably never sold my jersey in New York until I left,” he said. Oakley added that he still attended three or four Knicks games every season, always paying his own way. And every time, he said, he would be watched by security personnel. He said that Dolan was behind their actions. “Anytime I go into the Garden, they have to call him and tell him where I’m at,” he said. “They got to let him know, ‘Oakley is in the building. ’” He added: “It’s so disrespectful. I bought my tickets. And you’re going to tell someone he can’t walk around?” Oakley sounded most upset when he said that the Knicks had tarnished his relationships with many of his former teammates. Oakley recalled a game at the Garden last season when he bumped into a former teammate near the court. The teammate, Oakley said, apprehensively urged him to keep his voice down. “The guys I played with,” Oakley said, “they can’t even talk to me or be around me. ” On Thursday, in an interview on ESPN Radio, Oakley apologized for his role in Wednesday’s episode. “I feel sorry for the fans,” he said. The fans, in turn, seem to be on Oakley’s side. Welcome to the world of the Knicks.	1
286	In a momentous organizational   the Los Angeles Lakers fired General Manager Mitch Kupchak on Tuesday and put Magic Johnson, one of the greatest players in N. B. A. history, in charge of the team’s front office as its president for basketball operations. It was a stunning power play by Jeanie Buss, the team president and   who removed her brother Jim from his role as executive vice president for basketball operations. Jim Buss will retain his ownership stake, Jeanie Buss said in a statement, but will no longer have any involvement in personnel decisions. “I took these actions today to achieve one goal,” Jeanie Buss said in the statement. “Everyone associated with the Lakers will now be pulling in the same direction, the direction established by Earvin and myself,” she continued, using Johnson’s given name. “We are determined to get back to competing to win N. B. A. championships again. ” She added that a search for a new general manager  —   one who would report to Johnson  —   was underway. Johnson has been involved with the organization in various capacities for decades but has no direct experience actually running a team. In a statement, he described his new position as a “dream come true. ” He added: “We have a great coach in Luke Walton and good young players. We will work tirelessly to return our Los Angeles Lakers to N. B. A. champions. ” But the Lakers, a marquee franchise that has foundered in recent seasons, have a long way to go before they will be capable of vying for a playoff berth, let alone be considered title contenders. In their first season under Walton, their record is   the third worst in the league. They have not made the playoffs since the   season, the longest such drought in franchise history. Hours after the overhaul was announced, the Lakers traded Lou Williams, their leading scorer, to the Houston Rockets for Corey Brewer and a future draft pick, according to The Associated Press. Johnson, 57, a   most valuable player during his Hall of Fame playing career with the Lakers, has maintained associations  —   both official and unofficial  —   with the team since he retired in 1996. (He did not play for four seasons, from 1991 to 1995, after he learned that he had H. I. V.) He briefly coached the Lakers during the   season, but they went just   with him on the bench. Johnson, a successful entrepreneur outside basketball, owned a share of the Lakers from 1994 to 2010 and after that retained a position as honorary vice president. But last year, after Johnson continued to run afoul of the league’s tampering rules for posting on Twitter about free agents, the Lakers stripped him of that title. He remained a fierce advocate for the team  —   and an occasional critic, known in part for his close association with Jeanie Buss and his estrangement from her brother. The siblings’ turbulent relationship is one of the league’s   soap operas. In 2014, Jim Buss told The Los Angeles Times that he would step down if the team failed to make a playoff run within three years. About three weeks ago, Johnson returned to the team as an adviser to Jeanie Buss in a move that appeared to signal that more organizational changes could be coming. On Tuesday, two days before the N. B. A. ’s trade deadline, Buss cleaned house. She even fired John Black, the team’s longtime communications director. It is a drastic overhaul of a team that has been characterized by considerable stability in the general manager’s position. Kupchak was in his 17th season in control of player personnel, since taking over for another Lakers Hall of Famer, Jerry West. Kupchak, along with Coach Phil Jackson, was largely responsible for assembling the Lakers teams that won    championships in 2009 and 2010. More recently, however, the Lakers have been hindered by a series of   moves, including a failed experiment in 2012 to build a superteam around three aging and mismatched pieces: Kobe Bryant, Steve Nash and Dwight Howard. The Lakers were also limited in their ability to rebuild after signing Bryant to a huge contract extension in 2013. Last season, in what amounted to a glorified farewell tour before Bryant’s retirement, the Lakers finished with a   17 wins. In Johnson, the Lakers turn to their storied past in hope of a brighter future.	1
158	SAYON TOWN, Liberia  —   For the first time in 26 years, the electricity came on in Hayes Lewis’s modest house in this cluttered Monrovia suburb. The very next day, Mr. Lewis went out and purchased a television set, a fan and a single light bulb. The purchases cost him $250  —   about a quarter of a year’s income for the       . But it was money Mr. Lewis had been longing to spend. He remembers the time back in 1990 when the warlord Prince Johnson’s forces took over the area and fighting destroyed the nearby Mount Coffee hydroelectric plant, cutting off electricity  —   or, as Liberians call it, “current. ” “To have current, tha’ not small thing,” he said in Liberian English, motioning proudly at the light bulb in his bedroom. Except the light bulb was dark, the fan was still and the television screen was blank because the electricity, after making its much heralded return, had gone out again. On New Year’s Day, a bandit trying to steal the copper wire from one of the light poles at the newly reopened Mount Coffee Hydropower Plant had electrocuted himself, prompting the shutdown of huge swaths of the system. Five days later, Mr. Lewis once again had no current. I asked him what he was going to do. Shrugging, Mr. Lewis trudged outside and put a large rectangle object on the table. “I wi’ use Chinese lantern,” he said, resignedly. After 26 years, the irony of the situation was beyond him. He supposedly had current, but he was still using the same makeshift battery light that had gotten him through the last two decades. But that is all par for the course here in this country that, 13 years after the civil war ended, is still trying to put back together the pieces that the war ripped apart. Fourteen years of war snuffed out 200, 000 lives and laid waste to Liberia, producing generals who led ritual sacrifices of children before going into battle, naked except for shoes and a gun. By the time the war was finally over in 2003 and Charles Taylor was escorted out of the country, to eventually face a war crimes conviction, the country was left a shell. Schools were shuttered. What passed for a middle class had fled. Infrastructure was destroyed. And current was gone, taking with it running water, streetlights, and the simple assumptions of everyday life, including walking into your house and turning on the lights, or opening your refrigerator and getting a cold glass of water. Downtown Monrovia at night looked medieval candles in shopfronts cast their dim light on the ribbons of dirty water running down the gutters. Liberians, as they have for decades, simply adapted. They acquired Tiger batteries, the   alternative to expensive generators, and used those to plug in their cellphones. Those cellphones they then used to light their way at night, as they traveled in the dark along rural roads and city streets. They bought   Chinese lanterns every other day. In Liberia, the phrase “Chinese lantern” does not apply to the     red and gold lights that people string up at Chinese New Year. Instead, it is an ugly square or rectangular   light, the kind you might use at a campground at night. Even the wealthiest Liberians  —   those with access to generators  —   still hoard electricity as if it’s about to be taken from them. If you walk into the average Liberian’s house during the day, you will not find any lights glowing, let alone   fans, televisions, radios or refrigerators running. In fact, most Liberians with generators don’t have refrigerators they have a deep freezer that they plug in for a few hours at night, long enough to get cold. Then they unplug it and keep the door closed, sometimes for up to two days, until they decide it needs another   juicing. When President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf arrived at the Mount Coffee plant on a Friday in December to flick the switch that would officially signal the reopening of the plant, it was a big deal here. Flanked by Linda   the Obama administration’s assistant secretary of state for African affairs, Ms. Sirleaf was visibly buoyant, in no small part because, as she nears the end of her term in office, she was finally making good on an early promise from 2006 that she would get Mount Coffee up and running again. The United States, Germany, Norway and the European Investment Bank contributed to the $357 million project, which was delayed after the Ebola outbreak in 2014. Finally, last summer, neighborhoods like Mr. Lewis’s began getting hooked up to the electrical grid, in anticipation of the hydropower plant’s reopening in December. But the process is slow. In Sayon Town, Mark Laffor, 30, was selling DVDs in his tiny stall, using the power of the same small generator that he has been using for years. He was supposed to be one of the people to benefit when Mount   electricity, with its far lower price tag, returned. But he said his current lasted only a couple of days before going back out. “We were having current but they said the pole was destroyed,” he said, shaking his head in frustration. A few houses down from Mr. Laffor,   old Nora Tabah, a market woman, proudly invited me into her home to show off the single light bulb she had recently installed in the hallway. “For years I was living in darkness,” she said. She was still living in darkness. Like Mr. Lewis, her current had gone out after a few days. But Ms. Tabah, who sells farina and kola nuts in front of her house, expressed optimism that things were about to change. “I ‘coming buy freezer,” she said. Hedrick Walker, 24, owns a shop in Sayon Town that sells “yama yama”  —   water, biscuits, Spam,   and the like. He said both his life and the town had changed now that Mount Coffee had come back on. “It’s more lively now,” he said. “I used to close at 6 p. m. ” when the sun goes down. “Now,” he said proudly, “I am open until 11 p. m. ”  —   at least on nights when the electricity is on. A few miles away, at Raymond Camp, just outside the Mount Coffee plant, Fatu Quay, 32, sitting at a table in her house that also serves as a shop, said that she was hedging her bets on electricity in Liberia. She spent $15 in December to purchase electricity when the power plant came online, and was pleased to see that two weeks later she still had money in her account. “But then the current went out,” she said, grinning. Quickly she switched back to the expensive generator that, for about $300 a month, has provided her with electricity at night, adding that she has no plans to get rid of it anytime soon. Like most Liberians, she said she didn’t use electricity during the day. But she is hoping that the cheaper Mount   electricity will return before her aunt comes to visit this month. “She’s coming from America,” Ms. Quay said, “so I will have to turn the current on in the day to run fan for her. ”	1

244	WASHINGTON  —   For seven years, few issues have animated conservative voters as much as the repeal of the Affordable Care Act. But with President Barack Obama out of office, the debate over “Obamacare” is becoming less about “Obama” and more about “care”  —   greatly complicating the issue for Republican lawmakers. Polling indicates that more Republicans want to make fixes to the law rather than do away with it. President Trump, who remains popular on the right, has mused about a replacement plan that is even more expansive than the original. The conservative news media are focused more on Mr. Trump’s   skirmishes with Democrats and reporters, among others, than on policy issues like health care. And the congressional debate, as well as the paid advertisements on both sides, is centered on the substance of the law rather than its namesake, draining some of its toxicity on the right. As liberals overwhelm congressional town   meetings and deluge the Capitol phone system with pleas to protect the health law, there is no similar clamor for dismantling it, Mr. Obama’s signature legislative accomplishment. From deeply conservative districts in the South and the West to the more moderate parts of the Northeast, Republicans in Congress say there is significantly less intensity among opponents of the law than when Mr. Obama was in office. “I hear more concerns than before about ‘You’re going to repeal it, and we’re all going to lose insurance’ because they don’t think we’re going to replace it,” said Representative Mike Simpson, a Republican who represents a conservative district in Idaho. Since Mr. Obama signed the Affordable Care Act into law, about 20 million Americans have gained insurance because of it. And millions more who had   health conditions have been able to obtain coverage under the law. At the same time, many Americans have seen their premiums rise or their choices of insurance carriers dwindle. But it was not until now, with the Republicans taking control of the federal government, that the debate fully shifted from the theoretical to the tangible. It was easy for conservatives to rally against a law identified with a president they despised when he was capable of vetoing any repeal. Now that he is gone and the law’s benefits appear to be on the chopping block, the people who stand to lose the most are the most vocal. “I’ve heard from constituents who have been harmed by the Affordable Care Act over the course of its being in existence,” said Representative Leonard Lance, Republican of New Jersey, whose affluent district Mr. Trump narrowly lost last year. “More recently, because of our discussions on repairing it, I’ve heard from those who do not wish to have the act amended. More recently, that is the preponderance of those who have contacted me. ” It is a longstanding rule of politics that rallying opposition to a proposal is usually easier than galvanizing support. And never is this more the case than when a widely distributed benefit is at risk of being taken away. “I was here in 2009 and 2010, and we’re not getting the   calls like that,” said Representative Brett Guthrie, a Kentucky Republican who is on one of the committees tasked with rewriting the law. “I think people are going to hold us accountable for making sure we not only repeal, but we have a law in place that creates a better opportunity for people. ” The demands from   constituents in districts like Mr. Guthrie’s are plainly shifting. In a nationwide CBS News poll last month, 53 percent of Republicans said they wanted to change the law to make it work better while 41 percent said they wanted to abolish it. Overhauling the law, however, is far more politically complicated than simply scrapping it. Congressional Republican leaders were met with a backlash from their own ranks after it emerged that they were considering financing a new law by ending the longstanding practice of letting employers exclude from taxation the health benefits they offer. “Our voters do expect action, but as you make changes you become vulnerable to attack,” Representative Tom Cole of Oklahoma said. “This is fraught with difficulties, no doubt about it. ” Adding to the anxiety is Mr. Trump, who is a wild card on the health law. His health secretary, Tom Price, signaled to House Republicans at a private meeting on Thursday that the administration would let Congress draft a replacement bill, Mr. Cole said. But the president has said multiple times that he is uneasy about depriving anybody of health insurance, and he may bridle if Democrats attack any Republican plan that may lead to that. As Democrats note, Mr. Trump owes his victory in part to voters who have benefited from the law. “A lot of economically vulnerable Republican voters have come to rely on government’s involvement in making sure they have affordable health care,”said Geoff Garin, a Democratic pollster. And with Mr. Trump and Republican lawmakers facing less pressure from the right than the left, conservative groups worry that the party will not ultimately have the stomach to repeal the law, which Republicans have been running against since 2010. “Voters gave Republicans the charge to repeal and replace Obamacare, and the continued delays and discussions about repairing Obamacare need to stop,” David McIntosh, the head of the Club for Growth, a conservative advocacy group, said last week.	1
957	 In fact, the donations [Johnson] collected helped only herself to “rise” in society. A class action lawsuit, stated that Johnson had “solicited donations from vulnerable people to help others but instead used it to help herself.”According to the document, the Black Lives Matter leading figure, purchased a $1.2 million home for herself. But this is not all, instead of using the donations to help people she also bought herself a brand new Range rover as well as some “other exorbitancies”. Unfortunately, it’s likely that what she did was perfectly legal because she solicited the funds through a GoFundMe campaign and the company is notoriously bad at working with police to crack down on scammers. Johnson was questioned by police, but denies misusing funds. She refuses to hand over records.

505	 PS Dear Donald – To be clear, my decision to Trump myself has nothing to do with you personally. However, if you’re nevertheless feeling a slight twinge of guilt for gobbling up all the bandwith, I’d like to suggest a simple path to atonement. I run a modest foundation called @mikeroweWORKS. We award work ethic scholarships to people who wish to learn a skill that’s actually in demand. So far, we’ve distributed over $3 million dollars for the kind of training that gets tradespeople jobs. Anyway, my approach to fund raising is what you might call “non-traditional.” Yesterday, I auctioned off an old bathrobe, stolen from a swanky spa in Napa for $8,405.00. Check it out. http://www.ebay.com/itm/-/252381732048…This got me thinking – how much might someone bid for a bathrobe from The Trump Tower? (I took my Mom and Dad there a few months ago, and they had a ball. My Dad still has your slippers, and refuses to part with them.)I’d like to make a deal. If you’ve got a spare robe in the hotel inventory that you’re willing to part with, I’d love to auction it off for the benefit of mikeroweWORKS. What do you say? Might be fun to see what someone would pay for a Trump bathrobe that rewards work ethic. I guarantee that millions of voters will see the auction, and thousands of dollars will be raised. It’ll be Yuge!PPS. Hell, if you autograph the thing in laundry-proof marker, I bet we could raise enough dough to close the skills gap next week… PPPS Obviously, I can’t promise to vote for you simply because you send me an autographed bathrobe to auction off for a good cause. That sort of inducement – as I’m sure you know – would preclude the non-partisan nature of my foundation. Full disclosure – If Hillary and Bernie sent me a pantsuit and a rumpled jacket – respectively – I’d auction those off in heartbeat… As some of you might recall, I auctioned off my ratty old bathrobe several months ago, which raised $8,500 dollars for our scholarship fund. Shortly thereafter, I commented that a better bathrobe, one from Trump Tower and signed by Donald J. Trump, just might raise enough money to close the skills gap. (I also suggested that a tasteful pantsuit from Hillary Clinton, or a similar bathrobe from President Bill Clinton – either of which I’d happily model – would be a most welcome auction item for mikeroweWORKS.)Well, thanks to the magical synapses of social media, I am now in receipt of a genuine Trump bathrobe – hand delivered to me a few weeks ago in Baltimore, by a whirling dervish named Tana Goertz who works for Mr. Trump. As the attached video attests, Donald Trump is not only aware of mikeroweWORKS, he supports our objectives, and apparently took my challenge at face value.  Hillary refused to send anything and then gave Rowe a call. She had a conversation with him about the charity and determined she would not donate. Mike Rowe then asked her if she had any Christian values. She refused to answer. That is horrifying to think that a presidential candidate refuses to have Christian values! I am scared for our country. I am scared for our children. We need to fix this! Can you believe what she did?	0
449	When the San Francisco Symphony canceled an upcoming pair of concerts in North Carolina to protest the state’s law curbing protections for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people, it suddenly found itself with a hole in its calendar. It found a pointed way to fill it. Michael Tilson Thomas, the orchestra’s music director, is planning “Symphony Pride,” a gala concert to highlight the musical contributions of lesbian and gay composers, with the money it raises going to four nonprofit organizations that provide services for L. G. B. T. people. Given the contributions gay composers have made to American music, from the   to Broadway, Mr. Thomas said in an telephone interview that he was surprised to discover that the orchestra had not done a similar concert before. “It just seemed to me to be something that would have happened a number of times,” said Mr. Thomas, who is gay. “But as it turns out, no, as far as we know it hasn’t happened. ” The pride concert, which will be held on April 4 at Davies Symphony Hall in San Francisco, will feature music by composers including Lou Harrison, Henry Cowell, Meredith Monk and John Cage. Audra McDonald will perform a selection of songs by Leonard Bernstein, Stephen Sondheim and Kander and Ebb she will also narrate Aaron Copland’s “Lincoln Portrait. ” In December, the San Francisco Symphony canceled concerts it had planned to give on April 5 and 6 in Chapel Hill, N. C. joining a growing list of artists who have shunned the state, including Bruce Springsteen, Ringo Starr and the violinist Itzhak Perlman. The orchestra did so to protest a law, commonly known as House Bill 2, that nullified local ordinances establishing   protections for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people, and required people in public buildings to use restrooms that correspond with the gender listed on their birth certificates. Gov. Roy Cooper of North Carolina, a Democrat who was elected in November, has been trying to persuade the   legislature to repeal the measure, which he has called a hindrance to attracting business to the state. “It’s the old story,” Mr. Thomas said. “Once people in society figure out a way of depriving this group of people of their rights, well, it’s very easy to go on and think of some other group they can deprive of their rights next. ” Most of the proceeds of the “Symphony Pride” concert will go to Larkin Street Youth Services, the Transgender Law Center, the National Center for Lesbian Rights, and the Trevor Project. Asked if the orchestra might host future pride concerts or galas, Mr. Thomas replied, “As my mother would have said, ‘From your lips to God’s ears. ’”	1
233	A week before Michael T. Flynn resigned as national security adviser, a sealed proposal was   to his office, outlining a way for President Trump to lift sanctions against Russia. Mr. Flynn is gone, having been caught lying about his own discussion of sanctions with the Russian ambassador. But the proposal, a peace plan for Ukraine and Russia, remains, along with those pushing it: Michael D. Cohen, the president’s personal lawyer, who delivered the document Felix H. Sater, a business associate who helped Mr. Trump scout deals in Russia and a Ukrainian lawmaker trying to rise in a political opposition movement shaped in part by Mr. Trump’s former campaign manager Paul Manafort. At a time when Mr. Trump’s ties to Russia, and the people connected to him, are under heightened scrutiny  —   with investigations by American intelligence agencies, the F. B. I. and Congress  —   some of his associates remain willing and eager to wade into   efforts behind the scenes. Mr. Trump has confounded Democrats and Republicans alike with his repeated praise for the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin, and his desire to forge an   alliance. While there is nothing illegal about such unofficial efforts, a proposal that seems to tip toward Russian interests may set off alarms. The amateur diplomats say their goal is simply to help settle a grueling,   conflict that has cost 10, 000 lives. “Who doesn’t want to help bring about peace?” Mr. Cohen asked. But the proposal contains more than just a peace plan. Andrii V. Artemenko, the Ukrainian lawmaker, who sees himself as a   leader of a future Ukraine, claims to have evidence  —   “names of companies, wire transfers”  —   showing corruption by the Ukrainian president, Petro O. Poroshenko, that could help oust him. And Mr. Artemenko said he had received encouragement for his plans from top aides to Mr. Putin. “A lot of people will call me a Russian agent, a U. S. agent, a C. I. A. agent,” Mr. Artemenko said. “But how can you find a good solution between our countries if we do not talk?” Mr. Cohen and Mr. Sater said they had not spoken to Mr. Trump about the proposal, and have no experience in foreign policy. Mr. Cohen is one of several Trump associates under scrutiny in an F. B. I. counterintelligence examination of links with Russia, according to law enforcement officials he has denied any illicit connections. The two others involved in the effort have somewhat questionable pasts: Mr. Sater, 50, a   pleaded guilty to a role in a stock manipulation scheme decades ago that involved the Mafia. Mr. Artemenko spent two and a half years in jail in Kiev in the early 2000s on embezzlement charges, later dropped, which he said had been politically motivated. While it is unclear if the White House will take the proposal seriously, the diplomatic freelancing has infuriated Ukrainian officials. Ukraine’s ambassador to the United States, Valeriy Chaly, said Mr. Artemenko “is not entitled to present any alternative peace plans on behalf of Ukraine to any foreign government, including the U. S. administration. ” At a security conference in Munich on Friday, Mr. Poroshenko warned the West against “appeasement” of Russia, and some American experts say offering Russia any alternative to a    international agreement on Ukraine would be a mistake. The Trump administration has sent mixed signals about the conflict in Ukraine. But given Mr. Trump’s praise for Mr. Putin, John Herbst, a former American ambassador to Ukraine, said he feared the new president might be too eager to mend relations with Russia at Ukraine’s expense  —   potentially with a plan like Mr. Artemenko’s. It was late January when the three men associated with the proposed plan converged on the Loews Regency, a luxury hotel on Park Avenue in Manhattan where business deals are made in a lobby furnished with leather couches, over martinis at the restaurant bar and in private conference rooms on upper floors. Mr. Cohen, 50, lives two blocks up the street, in Trump Park Avenue. A lawyer who joined the Trump Organization in 2007 as special counsel, he has worked on many deals, including a   tower in the republic of Georgia and a   mixed martial arts venture starring a Russian fighter. He is considered a loyal lieutenant whom Mr. Trump trusts to fix difficult problems. The F. B. I. is reviewing an unverified dossier, compiled by a former British intelligence agent and funded by Mr. Trump’s political opponents, that claims Mr. Cohen met with a Russian representative in Prague during the presidential campaign to discuss Russia’s hacking of Democratic targets. But the Russian official named in the report told The New York Times that he had never met Mr. Cohen. Mr. Cohen insists that he has never visited Prague and that the dossier’s assertions are fabrications. (Mr. Manafort is also under investigation by the F. B. I. for his connections to Russia and Ukraine.) Mr. Cohen has a personal connection to Ukraine: He is married to a Ukrainian woman and once worked with relatives there to establish an ethanol business. Mr. Artemenko, tall and burly, arrived at the Manhattan hotel between visits to Washington. (His wife, he said, met the first lady, Melania Trump, years ago during their modeling careers, but he did not try to meet Mr. Trump.) He had attended the inauguration and visited Congress, posting on Facebook his admiration for Mr. Trump and talking up his peace plan in meetings with American lawmakers. He entered Parliament in 2014, the year that the former Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych fled to Moscow amid protests over his economic alignment with Russia and corruption. Mr. Manafort, who had been instrumental in getting Mr. Yanukovych elected, helped shape a political bloc that sprang up to oppose the new president, Mr. Poroshenko, a wealthy businessman who has taken a far tougher stance toward Russia and accused Mr. Putin of wanting to absorb Ukraine into a new Russian Empire. Mr. Artemenko, 48, emerged from the opposition that Mr. Manafort nurtured. (The two men have never met, Mr. Artemenko said.) Before entering politics, Mr. Artemenko had business ventures in the Middle East and real estate deals in the Miami area, and had worked as an agent representing top Ukrainian athletes. Some colleagues in Parliament describe him as corrupt, untrustworthy or simply insignificant, but he appears to have amassed considerable wealth. He has fashioned himself in the image of Mr. Trump, presenting himself as Ukraine’s answer to a rising class of nationalist leaders in the West. He even traveled to Cleveland last summer for the Republican National Convention, seizing on the chance to meet with members of Mr. Trump’s campaign. “It’s time for new leaders, new approaches to the governance of the country, new principles and new negotiators in international politics,” he wrote on Facebook on Jan. 27. “Our time has come!” Mr. Artemenko said he saw in Mr. Trump an opportunity to advocate a plan for peace in Ukraine  —   and help advance his own political career. Essentially, his plan would require the withdrawal of all Russian forces from eastern Ukraine. Ukrainian voters would decide in a referendum whether Crimea, the Ukrainian territory seized by Russia in 2014, would be leased to Russia for a term of 50 or 100 years. The Ukrainian ambassador, Mr. Chaly, rejected a lease of that kind. “It is a gross violation of the Constitution,” he said in written answers to questions from The Times. “Such ideas can be pitched or pushed through only by those openly or covertly representing Russian interests. ” The reaction suggested why Mr. Artemenko’s project also includes the dissemination of “kompromat,” or compromising material, purportedly showing that Mr. Poroshenko and his closest associates are corrupt. Only a new government, presumably one less hostile to Russia, might take up his plan. Mr. Sater, a longtime business associate of Mr. Trump’s with connections in Russia, was willing to help Mr. Artemenko’s proposal reach the White House. Mr. Trump has sought to distance himself from Mr. Sater in recent years. If Mr. Sater “were sitting in the room right now,” Mr. Trump said in a 2013 deposition, “I really wouldn’t know what he looked like. ” But Mr. Sater worked on real estate development deals with the Trump Organization on and off for at least a decade, even after his role in the stock manipulation scheme came to light. Mr. Sater, who was born in the Soviet Union and grew up in New York, served as an executive at a firm called Bayrock Group, two floors below the Trump Organization in Trump Tower, and was later a senior adviser to Mr. Trump. He said he had been working on a plan for a Trump Tower in Moscow with a Russian real estate developer as recently as the fall of 2015, one that he said had come to a halt because of Mr. Trump’s presidential campaign. (Mr. Cohen said the Trump Organization had received a letter of intent for a project in Moscow from a Russian real estate developer at that time but determined that the project was not feasible.) Mr. Artemenko said a mutual friend had put him in touch with Mr. Sater. Helping to advance the proposal, Mr. Sater said, made sense. “I want to stop a war, number one,” he said. “Number two, I absolutely believe that the U. S. and Russia need to be allies, not enemies. If I could achieve both in one stroke, it would be a home run. ” After speaking with Mr. Sater and Mr. Artemenko in person, Mr. Cohen said he would deliver the plan to the White House. Mr. Cohen said he did not know who in the Russian government had offered encouragement on it, as Mr. Artemenko claims, but he understood there was a promise of proof of corruption by the Ukrainian president. “Fraud is never good, right?” Mr. Cohen said. He said Mr. Sater had given him the written proposal in a sealed envelope. When Mr. Cohen met with Mr. Trump in the Oval Office in early February, he said, he left the proposal in Mr. Flynn’s office. Mr. Cohen said he was waiting for a response when Mr. Flynn was forced from his post. Now Mr. Cohen, Mr. Sater and Mr. Artemenko are hoping a new national security adviser will take up their cause. On Friday the president wrote on Twitter that he had four new candidates for the job.	1
532	 Pokemon GO, a mobile game that has captured the attention of millions of fans worldwide, is yet again the cause of a tragedy. Timmy Richards, A 15 year old Florida teen, was arrested Sunday morning after stabbing his 13 year-old brother to death because, according to authorities, he thought his younger brother had deleted his Pokemon, when in reality, he had simply logged him out.Since the release of Pokemon GO earlier this week, it has been a hit, attracting millions of players from all age ranges. Encouraging players to travel on foot to find and capture the various Pokemon available. “Tragic, tragic, tragic” said Officer Gary Philips, who arrived at the scene a few minutes after the murder, “It’s sad to see a game capture it’s players so much that they are willing to kill others. Especially in this case, as it was all just a misunderstanding”. According to his family, Timmy was a very smart and peaceful person, rarely seen angry or agitated.	0

491	The Kansas Supreme Court ruled on Thursday that the state’s spending on public education was unconstitutionally low, dealing a new blow to Gov. Sam Brownback, who is facing a rebellion from his own Republican Party over his trademark   doctrine. In a unanimous ruling, the court said black, Hispanic and poor students were especially harmed by the lack of funding, pointing to lagging test scores and graduation rates. The justices set a June 30 deadline for lawmakers to pass a new constitutional funding formula, sending them scrambling to find more money to pay for a solution. This is the second time in about a year that Kansas’ highest court has ruled against the state’s approach to paying for schools, just as Mr. Brownback finds himself wrestling with growing budget deficits and as his relations with fellow Republicans have deteriorated to new lows. Mr. Brownback, who has made cutting taxes and shrinking government the centerpiece of his administration since taking office in 2011, championed the largest tax cuts in state history, turning Kansas into a national testing ground for his staunchly conservative philosophy. But the state has since struggled with gaping deficits, and patience has run thin, even among some former allies. Just last month, the   Legislature approved a tax increase that would have raised more than $1 billion to help narrow the budget gap  —   a bold rejection of Mr. Brownback’s vision. In the end, the governor vetoed the measure, and he barely survived an override attempt. The school funding ruling now adds yet another layer of fiscal trouble for Kansas and political tumult for Mr. Brownback. “Either the governor will have to bend, or we have to get enough votes in the House and Senate to override him,” Dinah Sykes, a Republican state senator, said, noting that lawmakers will have to get to work immediately to find money in the budget to satisfy the court’s requirements. “I thought that the tax plan that we put on his desk that was vetoed, I thought that was a compromise,” Ms. Sykes said. She added that lawmakers now had to prepare to find a legislative solution  —   with or without the governor. “We just have to dig in and figure out how to solve this problem,” she said. The court did not specify how much more money was needed for the state’s schools, but finding any could prove difficult. Current budget deficits reach into the hundreds of millions. “I think there’s a clear supermajority of legislators that want to move away from Brownback economics and the failed tax experiments,” said State Representative Jim Ward, the Democratic leader in the Kansas House. “Now the school decision expedites the importance of getting that done sooner rather than later. ” Mr. Brownback, who is barred by term limits from seeking   next year, has faced plunging approval ratings and increasingly criticism from the moderate wing of the Republican Party. In a statement, he acknowledged that some students in Kansas had not received a suitable education, calling for a new funding formula to “right this wrong. ” “The Kansas Legislature has the opportunity to engage in transformative educational reform by passing a school funding system that puts students first,” Mr. Brownback said. “Success is not measured in dollars spent, but in higher student performance. ” He made a pitch for schools outside of the public education system, suggesting that parents “should be given the opportunity and resources to set their child up for success through other educational choices. ” School funding consumes about half of Kansas’ budget, and its political salience cuts across party lines. Kansas prides itself on its public schools, and, in many small towns, the high school serves as a community anchor. The right to a suitably funded education is enshrined in the state Constitution. The current lawsuit was prompted by a slide in education financing that began after the recession under Mr. Brownback’s predecessor as governor, Mark V. Parkinson, a Democrat. But the school funding mechanism has been litigated in Kansas courts for years, and there are sharp regional distinctions in how the issue is viewed. In the affluent Kansas City suburbs, where test scores are high, many want to preserve special taxes that benefit their local school districts. In rural and urban parts of the state, where incomes are lower and academic performance sometimes lags, plans to provide more   funding for minorities and poor students have greater resonance. “Because of the budget cuts, frozen budgets, we’ve had to eliminate almost all of our extended learning time,” said Alan Cunningham, the superintendent of Dodge City Public Schools, a district where the first language of a majority of students is not English. “Those kids are not able to get the time they need to learn the things that they need to learn to be successful,” Mr. Cunningham said. In its ruling, the court detailed statistics that showed   and Hispanic students, as well as poor students and those learning the English language, lagging behind their peers academically. Cynthia Lane, the superintendent of public schools in Kansas City, Kan. where more than 80 percent of students come from   households and qualify for free or   lunches, said lawmakers needed to make special provisions for disadvantaged children in the new funding plan. “For a decade, we have been cutting support  —   we have been offering less tutoring, less support, less enrichment,” said Dr. Lane, whose school district was one of the four plaintiffs in the case before the Supreme Court. “So this ruling today gives me great hope that we can start talking about our aspirations, not just worrying about protecting where we are. ” James E. Ryan, the dean of the Harvard Graduate School of Education, said that courts in school finance cases frequently order state legislatures to come up with funding formulas that are fair  —   and Kansas was no exception. “What you see in Kansas you see in states across the country,” he said. “Namely, that there is an achievement gap between poorer kids and more   kids, and between white students and students of color. ” Mark Tallman, a lobbyist for the Kansas Association of School Boards, said he was pleased with the court’s ruling and hopeful that it would result in more resources in schools. He also said the ruling was an indication that the political winds in Kansas had shifted against Mr. Brownback, particularly with a more moderate Legislature voted into office in November, when Democrats gained 13 seats. “I do think that this Legislature is much more interested in funding education,” Mr. Tallman said. “I think the election results suggest that voters are seeing problems with our funding system that they want to address. ” For now, Mr. Brownback has shown a willingness to use a veto pen, leaving it uncertain whether lawmakers can agree on a new school funding plan by the June deadline, and whether they can raise enough revenue to support it. “You have enormous political will in Kansas to make the changes necessary,” Mr. Ward, the Democratic lawmaker, said, “and any politician obstructing that does it at their own peril. ”	1

330	KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia  —   The poison used to kill Kim   the half brother of the North Korean leader Kim   was VX nerve agent, which is listed as a chemical weapon, the Malaysian police announced Friday. In a brief statement, Khalid Abu Bakar, the national police chief, said the substance was listed as a chemical weapon under the Chemical Weapons Conventions of 1997 and 2005, to which North Korea is not a party. South Korea has suggested that the killing was the work of the North Korean government. The revelation that a banned weapon was used in such a   killing raises the stakes over how Malaysia and the international community will respond. VX nerve agent can be delivered in two compounds that are mixed at the last moment to create a lethal dose. The police say that two women approached Mr. Kim at the airport with the poison on their hands and rubbed it on his face one after the other. Samples were taken from Mr. Kim’s skin and eyes. The poison was identified in a preliminary analysis by the Center for Chemical Weapons Analysis of the Chemistry Department of Malaysia, Mr. Khalid said. The Chemical Weapons Convention bans the use and stockpiling of chemical weapons, and North Korea is among the world’s largest possessors of such weapons. In 2014, the South Korean Defense Ministry said the North had stockpiled 2, 500 to 5, 000 tons of chemical weapons and had a capacity to produce a variety of biological weapons. (The North has conducted five nuclear tests since 2006.) VX is part of a family of nerve agents created decades ago during research into pesticides. It is tasteless and odorless and kills by causing uncontrollable muscle contractions, which eventually stop the victim from breathing. A dose of about 10 milligrams is enough to kill by skin contact, according to the Federation of American Scientists. Several world powers, including the United States and the former Soviet Union, once had large stockpiles of the nerve agent. American stores of VX were destroyed under the Chemical Weapons Convention of 1997, with incineration completed in 2012. In 1994 and 1995, the Japanese cult Aum Shinrikyo used homemade VX to attack three people, one of whom died. North Korea is estimated to have a chemical weapons production capability of up to 4, 500 metric tons during a typical year and 12, 000 tons during a period of extended crisis. It is widely reported to possess a large arsenal of chemical weapons, including mustard, phosgene and sarin gas, a United States Congressional Research Service report said last year. The announcement by Malaysia’s police chief came just a day after North Korea denied any responsibility for Mr. Kim’s death, accusing the Malaysian authorities of fabricating evidence of Pyongyang’s involvement under the influence of South Korea. With the North’s reclusive government on the defensive about the Feb. 13 killing of Mr. Kim, the estranged half brother of Kim   at the airport for the Malaysian capital, Kuala Lumpur, a statement attributed to the North Korean Jurists Committee said the greatest share of responsibility for the death “rests with the government of Malaysia” because Kim   died there. And in what could be seen as a threat to Malaysia, the statement noted that North Korea is a “nuclear weapons state. ” But in a case that has been filled with mysteries and odd plot twists, North Korea still would not acknowledge that the man killed was indeed Kim  . And it gave no indication that it would agree to Malaysia’s demands to question a senior staff member at the North Korean Embassy in Kuala Lumpur in the investigation into Mr. Kim’s death. Relatives and acquaintances of the two women Malaysia has accused of carrying out the killing, by applying poison to   ’s face as North Korean agents looked on, insisted they must have been duped into doing so, though the Malaysian authorities say otherwise. “I don’t believe Huong did such a thing,” said Doan Van Thanh, father of Doan Thi Huong, 28, a Vietnamese woman being held in Malaysia. “She was a very timid girl. When she saw a rat or frog, she would scream. ” Mr. Thanh, 63, said he had seen little of his daughter recently. He said she left the family’s home, in a village south of Hanoi, at 17 to attend community college, where she studied to be a pharmacist. She later left Vietnam to work in Malaysia without telling her family and rarely visited, Mr. Thanh said. When she returned home in January for the Tet holiday, he said, she stayed only a few days. On Thursday in Nghia Binh, Ms. Huong’s hometown, her brother, Doan Van Binh, said that she posted on Facebook under the alias Ruby Ruby. Her Facebook photographs and the attached location information appear to show that she had visited Malaysia twice since January, and her Facebook friends include several people who write in Korean. Mr. Binh said that Ms. Huong had also appeared in a singing contest on the television show “Vietnam Idol” in 2016. In a short video clip, a panel of judges rejected Ms. Huong after she sang just one line: “I want to stop breathing gloriously so that the loving memory will not fade. ” North Korea has called for the release of Ms. Huong, an Indonesian woman and a North Korean man who are being held by Malaysia in connection with the death of Mr. Kim. The statement on Thursday from the Jurists Committee was cited by the   Korean Central News Agency, in the first comment on the killing from the North’s official news media. The statement accused the Malaysian authorities of pursuing a case “full of loopholes and contradictions” that proved that its investigators “intended to frame us. ” It said Malaysia had done so under South Korean influence. The statement said Malaysia’s Foreign Ministry and the local hospital first told the North Korean Embassy in Kuala Lumpur that Mr. Kim had died of “heart stroke,” asking North Korea to take the body and cremate it. But Malaysian officials’ attitude began changing after the South Korean news media, citing anonymous sources, reported that Mr. Kim had been poisoned, according to the North Korean statement. “The Malaysian secret police got involved in the case and recklessly made it an established fact” that the death had been a poisoning, according to the North Korean statement, which did not refer to Mr. Kim by name. The statement questioned how Ms. Huong and the Indonesian suspect in the killing, Siti Aisyah, 25, had survived if, as Malaysian officials said, they had used their hands to apply a deadly poison.	1

493	KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia  —   The Malaysian Foreign Ministry said Friday that it was “greatly concerned” by the use of a banned chemical weapon in a public place to assassinate Kim   the half brother of North Korea’s leader, and has asked for international help in responding to the episode. “The ministry strongly condemns the use of such a chemical weapon by anyone, anywhere and under any circumstances,” the ministry said in a statement. “Its use at a public place could have endangered the general public. ” Malaysia has reported the use of the toxic chemical, VX nerve agent, to the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, which monitors chemical weapons banned under international conventions. The organization must now decide whether to bring the matter of the chemical’s illegal use before the United Nations Security Council. Analysis of chemical residue on Mr. Kim found it to be VX nerve agent. South Korea has blamed the North for the killing. The Malaysian police have identified seven North Korean men who remain wanted for questioning in the case. If there is compelling evidence that North Korea used the substance, the United States and its allies can push for a resolution against the North at the Security Council and for new sanctions. Washington can also place the North back on its   blacklist. But North Korea has already been under heavy sanctions for decades, and analysts say that new steps against the North will have a largely symbolic effect of “naming and shaming. ” Such a move could further dampen what is an already weak desire to start dialogue with the North to address its growing nuclear and missile threats, they said. Malaysia reported the incident to the O. P. C. W. soon after the discovery that the poison was VX nerve agent, and since then the organization has been providing Malaysia with assistance in its investigation of the killing. “The ministry is in close contact with the O. P. C. W. regarding the recent incident and the latter has provided the Malaysian authority with some technical materials that have been requested to assist in its investigation,” the ministry said. Mr. Kim, the elder brother of North Korean leader Kim   was killed on Feb. 13 at Kuala Lumpur International Airport by two foreign women who smeared his face with poison, the police say. The two women, one from Indonesia and one from Vietnam, have been charged with murder. North Korea, which has not been allowed to examine Mr. Kim’s body, asserts that he died of heart failure. North Korean officials contend that it is absurd for Malaysia to say that VX nerve agent was used since it is so toxic that many others at the airport also would have died. After Malaysia reported the use of the chemical, representatives of the O. P. C. W. came to Kuala Lumpur to provide assistance, one official said. “The government of Malaysia will fully cooperate with the O. P. C. W. and other international organizations to bring the perpetrators to justice,” the ministry said. The Malaysian authorities on Friday released Ri   the only North Korean detained in the killing so far, and handed him over to immigration officials for deportation. The police also issued an arrest warrant for Kim   37, a North Korean who works for Air Koryo, the national airline. The authorities have said that they believed Mr. Kim was at the North Korean Embassy in Kuala Lumpur along with another suspect, Hyon   an embassy employee.	1

417	For a brief few minutes, “La La Land” lovers relished the victory, while those rooting for “Moonlight” to win best picture turned the TV off or tweeted their anguish. Then, in an awkward series of events sure to be permanently etched into Hollywood lore, it turned out to be fake news. Anguish and celebration turned to confusion. Presenting the   award at the end of a long Oscars evening, Warren Beatty opened the envelope and after some hesitation, his fellow presenter Faye Dunaway announced that “La La Land” was the winner. Moments later, even as “La La Land” speeches began, a producer of that film made it clear that, in fact, “Moonlight” was the winner. The words “WHAT IS HAPPENING?” trended on Twitter. It was stunning for such a   to happen on one of the most   stages possible. Rumors long held that Marisa Tomei was given her best supporting actress award in 1993 by mistake, but those rumors have been thoroughly debunked.

710	 whew! rest easy you guysPosted by FM 94/9 on Friday, January 15, 2016 Recently on “The 700 Club,” Pat Robertson fielded a question from a teenage viewer who wanted to know if it is a sin to listen to rock music. The televangelist said that while people shouldn’t try to completely avoid mainstream music, they should be wary of listening to songs that may contain violent, satanic lyrics and beats that could summon demonic beings. “It depends on what rock you’re listening to,” he said. “Some of the stuff is just evil. They used to talk about killing your parents. There were odes to Satan. You don’t want that stuff coming into your mind. In one Indian context, they were playing rock music and the person said, ‘Why are you calling on the demons?’ because that was the kind of music they used to summon demons.”“And it’s true, just look at what happened to David Bowie,” Robertson continued. “I mean, here you have a person who everybody is referring to as a legendary musician, an innovator, someone who changed the course of pop music history. In reality, Bowie was a deeply tormented gay drug addict, and it showed through his music and on his face. I mean, just take a look at any picture of him and tell me that’s not true. Tell me he doesn’t look like he just finished having a gay orgy, complete with a ton of drugs. And now people think he is dead. I’m kind of thinking, na-aah, no way. I’m thinking the demons kidnapped him to entertain them in Hell, because they got tired of mainstream punk-rock, and suddenly decided they were in the mood for some ‘Space Oddity.’” Newslo is the first hybrid News/Satire platform on the web.

702	 The Center for Disease Control and Prevention announced Monday that it is looking into 183 more cases of parasitic roundworm disease linked to the McDonald’s restaurant chain. This is in addition to the 5 original cases that happened in Chicago in late December. However, the parasites that caused these new illnesses appears to be a bit different from the DNA fingerprint that involved the smaller outbreak last month.According to the CDC, this new case is a result of the filler used in McDonald’s so-called “all beef patties.” Testing revealed the beef patties contain 23% ground worm filler. Further investigation showed purchases made from Roger Lee’s Worm Farm by the fast food giant as far back as 2008. As McDonald’s CEO Ray Kroc noted at the time, the rumor didn’t even make sense from a financial standpoint: Rather than saving the company money, the idea of using of worm meat as a “cheap filler” was nonsensical because worms were much more expensive than beef:Ray Kroc, who bought McDonald’s from Mac and Dick McDonald in 1955, added his own assurances: “We couldn’t afford to grind worms into our meat,” he countered. “Hamburger costs a dollar and a half a pound, and night crawlers six dollars.”	0

Here’s the video. _____ • Mr. Trump’s plans to have Stephen A. Feinberg, above, a billionaire investor with no intelligence experience, review the U. S. intelligence agencies has the agencies’ top officials on edge.

445	President Trump hasn’t been saving jobs in the last few weeks, focusing his energy (and Twitter feed) on how to close the borders to immigrants instead. When he gets back to it, he might spend less time on the workers putting together   units in Indiana and more  —   a lot more  —   on the maids and janitors who clean Trump golf resorts and hotels. This is not to accuse the president of being hypocritical by skewering companies that move production overseas while, say, selling Trump merchandise made in Bangladesh, or loudly championing the cause of the working man while refusing to recognize the rights of workers at his branded properties. Rather, it is to argue that by obsessing over how the manufacturing jobs of the 1970s were lost to globalization, Mr. Trump is missing a more critical workplace transformation: the vast outsourcing of many tasks  —   including running the cafeteria, building maintenance and security  —   to     subcontractors within the United States. This reorganization of employment is playing a big role in keeping a lid on wages  —   and in driving income inequality  —   across a much broader swath of the economy than globalization can account for. David Weil, a professor of management at the Questrom School of Business at Boston University who headed the Labor Department’s wage and hour division at the end of the Obama administration, calls this process the “fissuring” of the workplace. He traces it to the 1980s, when corporations under pressure to raise quarterly profits started shedding “noncore” tasks. The trend grew as the spread of information technology made it easier for companies to standardize and monitor the quality of outsourced work. Many employers took to outsourcing to avoid the messy consequences  —   like unions and workplace regulations  —   of employing workers directly. “It’s an incredibly important part of the story that we haven’t paid attention to,” Mr. Weil told me. “Lead businesses  —   the firms that continue to directly employ workers who provide the goods and services in the economy recognized by consumers  —   remain highly profitable and may continue to provide generous pay for their work force,” he noted. “The workers whose jobs have been shed to other, subordinate businesses face far more competitive market conditions. ” The trend is hard to measure, since subcontracting can take many forms. But it is big. A study last year by Lawrence F. Katz of Harvard and Alan B. Krueger of Princeton, a former chief economic adviser to President Barack Obama, concluded that independent contractors,   workers and workers provided by contracting companies or temp agencies accounted altogether for 94 percent of employment growth over the last 10 years. Nonstandard employment arrangements like these account for nearly one in six jobs today. That is 24 million jobs, nine million more than 10 years ago. Many of these jobs are poorly paid. A 2008 study by Arindrajit Dube of the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, and Ethan Kaplan, then at the Institute for International Economic Studies at Stockholm University, found that outsourcing imposed a wage penalty of up to 7 percent for janitors and up to 24 percent for security guards. The Government Accountability Office of Congress concluded that contingent workers in the education field  —   substitute teachers, adjuncts and the like  —   earn almost 14 percent less per hour. In retailing they earn 9. 4 percent less. Contingent workers across the board are less likely to have health insurance.   live in families making less than $20, 000 a year. That is three times the share of workers employed in standard   jobs. The rise of outsourced work adds an important twist to the standard understanding of America’s growing wage inequality, which is based on the notion that technology has left   workers behind  —   taking over their routine jobs while opening lucrative new possibilities for the  . The sorting of workers into different classes of companies will further widen the earnings gap as the rewards of the most profitable among them “increasingly go to a more limited group of highly compensated and   workers and to shareholders,” Professor Katz explained. Manufacturing has gone through this process. General Motors in its heyday employed more than 600, 000 workers in the United States, including the engineer, the man sweeping the shop floor and the woman serving coffee. Though the engineer certainly earned much more, the other two could share in G. M.’s success. Norms of fairness, Mr. Weil argues, would limit the wage gap between workers of a single company, giving a boost to those at the bottom. Outsourcing does away with such considerations. Apple is as successful as G. M. was in its time. But it employs fewer than 70, 000 people in the United States. While it keeps engineers, designers and such in house, it doesn’t bother with workers not critical to creating seductive new gadgets. Many of those work for Foxconn, in Asia, where the margins are slimmer and the pay is not as good. The trend is not unique to manufacturing nor to outsourcing overseas, though. It is happening across the nation’s    workplaces and coursing through service industries, the   segment of the labor market. These days the receptionist at the front desk is unlikely to work for the hotel. The truck driver may not work for the delivery company, nor the nurse for the hospital. Jobs in coal mining and hydraulic fracturing  —   even shipbuilding  —   have been siphoned off. Though the gig economy is still small  —   employing 0. 5 percent of contingent workers, according to Professors Katz and Krueger  —   the technologies powering it are likely to fissure the American workplace further. This sorting would increase the slice of national income going to shareholders and reduce workers’ share. The pattern is consistent with evidence that most of the widening of the nation’s earnings inequality can be explained by growing pay gaps between organizations rather than within them. Over all, Professor Katz estimates, the sorting of workers into   and   employers accounts for a quarter to a third of the increase of wage inequality in the United States since 1980. So can Mr. Trump do anything about this? When at the Labor Department, Mr. Weil argued that companies that outsource should share liability with subcontractors for wages and working conditions, so they could not simply wash their hands of responsibility. It’s not an easy problem to fix, though. As Mr. Weil puts it, “How do you reattach some of the responsibility to the engine of value of these network business systems?” Companies will continue to seek efficiencies by shunting work into these broader networks. And it would make little sense to adopt policies that forbid this kind of business organization. Encouraging unions, which many scholars have suggested as a tool to improve wage growth, could well accelerate the splintering. And yet, there may be a place for incentives to discourage the weakening of labor standards. Some employers might adopt a system like Harvard’s parity policy to ensure that those in contract positions like guards or cafeteria workers get the same pay and benefits as comparable university staff members. Whatever its difficulties, addressing the vast transformation underway in the organization of work seems more relevant than tilting at windmills in hopes of restoring American manufacturing to its 1950s state.	1
291	Chamber music might not seem like an obvious candidate to be “chopped and screwed”: remixed and slowed down in the style pioneered by DJ Screw when he transformed Houston’s   scene a generation ago. But that unlikely inspiration helped give the film “Moonlight,” whose score is nominated for an Academy Award, its otherworldly sound. The unusual idea emerged when the film’s director, Barry Jenkins, was batting around musical possibilities with its composer, Nicholas Britell, and Mr. Jenkins mentioned his love of chopped and screwed tracks. (The style can give songs a woozy, psychedelic flavor.) “When you slow the music down, the pitch goes down,” Mr. Britell, 36, said in an interview in his Manhattan studio. “And you actually get this audio texture which is deepened and enriched and you hear more things in it. It sort of opens it up and stretches it out. ” Here is how Mr. Britell chopped and screwed instrumental music and wove it into a film whose three chapters take its hero, Chiron, from boyhood (when the character is nicknamed Little) to manhood (when he’s known as Black). When he first read the screenplay, Mr. Britell said, “it felt like a piece of poetry. ” Mr. Jenkins knew that he wanted an orchestral score. So Mr. Britell wrote a simple, somber, plangent piece that he initially called “Piano and Violin Poem,” which he recorded in D major. It became “Little’s Theme. ” For the teenage Chiron, Mr. Britell bent the pitch of “Little’s Theme” until it was in B major. Then, for a harrowing scene involving a schoolyard fight, he slowed the music drastically, until it was almost unrecognizable  —   more than two octaves lower than the original recording. “We were trying, in the music, to have there be a correspondence between the   nature of Chiron’s world at that point and what’s happening musically without being too overt about it,” Mr. Britell said. “In that scene you’re hearing this rumbling. You almost don’t know what it is. And then you hear something that almost sounds like a bell, and almost sounds like a bass  —   and in fact it’s the piano and the violins from the very beginning. ” For the theme music for Chiron’s adulthood, Mr. Britell reorchestrated “Little’s Theme” for an ensemble of cellos and had them record it in D major  —   but then bent the pitch until it was in A major. “I chopped and screwed the recording,” he said. “Cellos don’t play those notes. It sounds like a weird cross between basses and cellos. ” Many members of the audience may not notice that some of the more fantastic effects in the score are its main themes contorted beyond recognition. But the filmmakers do wink at the audience when they include a more traditional kind of chopped and screwed track: the   mix of Jidenna’s “Classic Man” that plays in the background in this scene. The popularity of the soundtrack led to a performance last month in Los Angeles, when the Wordless Music Orchestra performed the score live as the film was screened another outing is planned at the Barbican Center in London on March 18. But mimicking the effects of chopped and screwed with live orchestra took some serious reverse engineering. “If it’s a violin that sounds like a bass, I’ll have a bass play it,” Mr. Britell said.	1
487	Here’s another possible consequence of repealing the Affordable Care Act: It would be harder for many people to retire early. Americans reaching 65 become eligible for Medicare. Before reaching that age, some can get retiree coverage from their former employers. But not very many companies, especially small ones, offer medical insurance to retirees. If early retirees are poor enough, they could turn to Medicaid. To retire early, everybody else would need to turn to the individual health insurance market. Without the subsidies and protections the A. C. A. put in place, health care coverage would be more difficult to obtain, cost consumers more where available, and provide fewer benefits than it does today. That means that if the A. C. A. is repealed, retiring early would become less feasible for many Americans. This consequence is called job lock  —   the need to maintain a job to get health insurance. One of the arguments in favor of the A. C. A. was that it would reduce or eliminate job lock. With repeal of the law on the agenda of Congress and President Trump, there is renewed concern about how health insurance could affect employment and retirement decisions. These relationships have been examined extensively by scholars. Though not all studies have found evidence of job lock in the   era, a majority of   studies have. That’s the conclusion of systematic reviews conducted by the Government Accountability Office and several health economists. Because people approaching retirement age are more prone to illness and high health care costs,   insurance is particularly valuable to older workers  —   so much so that many studies document that it influences retirement decisions. One study found that workers whose employers offered retiree health benefits were 68 percent more likely to retire early than those who lack   retiree coverage. Another study found a smaller effect, 47 percent. But that study also found that workers in poor health who had retiree health benefits were 88 percent more likely to retire early compared with similar workers lacking retiree health benefits. Both those studies used data that are now several decades old. But a 2014 study that incorporated more recent data  —   though still  . C. A.  —   also found that retiree health benefits encourage early retirement. The inference from these studies is that coverage options in the A. C. A. marketplaces would similarly encourage early retirement. Deferring retirement because of health benefits is just one form of job lock. Another example: Many studies show that spouses are much more likely to work if their partners do not have   family coverage. Other studies show that workers with cancer are more likely to continue working if that’s how they get health insurance. Two studies led by Cathy Bradley of Virginia Commonwealth University examined working women with breast cancer diagnoses. Both studies found that those who depended on their employment for coverage were more likely to remain working. If not for job lock, we’d probably see greater job mobility and entrepreneurship. According to one analysis, two million more people would change jobs if it weren’t for job lock  —   presumably finding work that makes them happier or that is better suited for them. One study found that      married men with no other coverage options are 22. 5 percent less likely to switch jobs compared with those who have alternatives. Another study, examining      married men, estimated smaller effects, between 10 and 15 percent. The evidence of sticking with jobs instead of starting a business is mixed, but the preponderance of it suggests this kind of “entrepreneurship lock” exists, affecting up to four million people. Workers without coverage from a spouse  —   therefore, more reliant on their own employers’ coverage  —   are a few percentage points less likely to become   according to one study. Similarly,   spikes when workers turn 65 and obtain Medicare coverage. From the late 1980s to the early 2000s, tax deductibility of policies for   workers was phased in, making those policies more affordable. Two studies provide evidence that this change increased  . One found that it rose 10 percent among women without health coverage from a spouse versus those with such coverage. Another found that the tax change explained as much as half the total increase in   between 1999 and 2004. All of these studies suggest that job lock would be alleviated by more available and affordable coverage outside work. Whether Obamacare did that is less clear. Many policy experts expected the A. C. A. to reduce job lock. An analysis by the Urban Institute, conducted before the health insurance reforms were implemented, estimated that the   would increase by about 1. 5 million individuals as a result of the law. In 2014, the Congressional Budget Office anticipated that the A. C. A. would reduce the size of the labor force by at least two million people by 2024. One  . C. A. study found that the prohibition of   condition exclusions for children increased job mobility for their parents. And in the months after the insurance market reforms rolled out, voluntary   work increased and the growth in the number of workers over age 55 slowed, both consistent with alleviation of job lock. But more rigorous studies of   work did not find an impact from the A. C. A. According to a review of scientific papers by the economists Jean Abraham and Anne Royalty, for the University of Pennsylvania’s Leonard Davis Institute of Health Economics, few other studies have found solid evidence that the A. C. A. reduced job lock or had other effects on the labor market. For instance, studies have not found that allowing children to stay on their parents’ insurance until age 26 has influenced the labor market choices of young adults. Nor have they found that the A. C. A. increased early retirement or employment more generally. One reason studies might not have found an impact on job lock could be because the law is relatively new, and there isn’t enough data available to researchers to tease out all its effects. It could also be because the law has been under siege on multiple fronts since passage, rendering its status uncertain. This may have raised doubts in workers’ minds about the wisdom of relying on it as a substitute for   coverage. But it is clear that with A. C. A. repeal on the table, people contemplating early retirement may need to reconsider.	1
612	 In a Donald Trump administration, the U.S. military will be so strong that Mexico won’t dare to go to war over the wall Trump wants to build between the two countries. On MSNBC on Wednesday, journalist Bob Woodward asked Trump, “Would you be willing to go to war to make sure we get the money to pay for this wall?” “Trust me Bob, when I rejuvenate our military, Mexico’s not going to be playing with us with war, that I can tell you. Mexico isn’t playing with us with war,” Trump responded Wednesday. One of Trump’s signature proposals is a promise to build a wall between the United States and make Mexico pay for it, despite Mexican officials’ emphatic insistence that they’ll never cough up the dough.“Because nobody every messes with the American military, everybody knows that, the whole world knows that,” the billionaire businessman added. “We have the single most powerful military machinery in the history of the world, on the entire planet. To go head-on against such an adversary is suicide, and they know that. That’s how I know they’re bluffing, because nobody is willing to commit suicide just to prove a point. And my point is, I’m going to make Mexico pay for that wall, and when I’m done building it, I’m going to get on top and play Bruce Springsteen’s ‘Born In The USA’ to them, just for the hell of it. You just don’t mess with the U.S., and that’s that … Let me tell you, we’ve had a similar problem with disobedience back in World War II. And you know how we fixed it? We nuked Japan, and then they surrendered very shortly. So, I think that’s a pretty definitive message, and that’s the hard way. Now, I’ve said before that political correctness is what’s killing this country, and I’m standing by it. However, since I’ve never been a warmonger, I’m trying to tell them nicely that the ball is in their court. If they agree to pay, we’ll have no problem. If they don’t and they start acting up, well, we’ll just have to watch a re-run of the Japanese episode.” On MSNBC on Wednesday, journalist Bob Woodward asked Trump, “Would you be willing to go to war to make sure we get the money to pay for this wall?”“Trust me, Bob, when I rejuvenate our military, Mexico’s not going to be playing with us with war, that I can tell you.

912	 Former Saved By The Bell star Dustin Diamond, best known for his awkwardly hilarious character Samuel “Screech” Powers on the timeless popular hit teen television series Saved By The Bell, has been charged with second-degree murder after a man he stabbed during a barroom brawl has died at a Wisconsin hospital.Diamond, 37, initially told police that he accidentally stabbed the man with what he said was a ‘pen’, although he later referred to the weapon, which was never found, as a knife. According to Diamond, while trying to defend his fiance, 27-year-old Amanda Schutz, at the Grand Avenue Saloon in Port Washington, where Diamond is a resident, he was forced to brandish the weapon.Diamond was initially charged with second-degree recklessly endangering safety, disorderly conduct, and carrying a concealed weapon and was released on $10,000 bail before the man, only being referred to by the name of ‘Casey’ per request of family, passed away. Originally reported that Casey was completely fine and his wounds mostly superficial, reports say he took a turn for the worse after a wound from the fight became infected. He died on the operating room table.	0
935	 I can’t do anything. I’m sitting in a different country. It’s all about trust, you know? If you are working with someone online, it’s all about trust, and they just screwed us not paying. I’m getting married next month and I was collecting that money [for marriage expenses]. So I’m very disappointed and very sad they did this to us. I’m reaching out today to inform you about payment for May 2018. As you know, monetization is done through Facebook Instant Articles. As of now, Facebook has put our May 2018 payment on hold. We have been trying to communicate with Facebook to get clarity on when the payment will be made.We heard back from Facebook on Friday, June 29 and they advised us that they will let us know about the payment at the end of July 2018. As soon we hear more from Facebook, we’ll let you know. I’ve worked so hard to build up my page and business since 2012. It began as a blog in 2010, and the page was supposed to just be part of that, but it took off so successfully that I focused on that instead. My page has been so successful in part because I interact with my page fans, and they are very loyal to me. It’s been absolutely devastating to get a permanent link ban when I was not even given a warning by Facebook that I was committing an infraction. I 100% understand why you may be reluctant to post external content. It’s really important to know that the content provider is 100% compliant with FB policies. We work with hundreds of publishers globally, both blue verified and not verified. We do a lot of work with FB so we actually have a liaison that is our point of contact when they make changes. Their role is to ensure we stay 100% compliant so we’ve never had an issue with producing external content that is harmful to pages. Hi Florind, after 2/28, Facebook pages are no longer allowed to post links from websites that are not ours. I’ve been with Diply for the past year, and they are terminating their program Feb. 28, due to Facebook’s new rule about branded content. I do not want to risk having my page unpublished by posting links … If not for the new policy, I would have enjoyed the opportunity with Providr. Our understanding of the policy update is that Facebook requires Page owners to contribute to the post by writing a review of the articles that you are sharing. We have also developed new technology that will include your Page Name, Links and FB Page Picture on our editorials. The bio is customizable. As per the agreement, we are on a revenue share which means you’ll get the revenue owed to you if we get it. I am sorry about this but we are on the same boat here. Please wait till the end of July till we hear back. We are contacting the Winklevoss twin’s [sic] lawyers and please be assured that we won’t let it go either.	0
15	BEIRUT, Lebanon  —   To the overnight editor at the Arab affairs website, it looked like big news: Kuwait, apparently following the lead of President Trump, had issued a visa ban on citizens from five other predominantly Muslim countries. The editor wrote an article, and the news rocketed through cyberspace. One link caught the eye of Mr. Trump himself, who shared it on his official Facebook page with a word of praise for the reported policy: “Smart!” But there was a problem: The Kuwait ban was from 2011, long before Mr. Trump announced a similar measure in the United States, said James Brownsell, the managing editor of The New Arab, the site that produced that article on Feb. 1. His writer did not notice that the news was years old. Many sites that often support Mr. Trump and also published the report, including Infowars. com and Russia’s Sputnik news agency, have since clarified that it was outdated and unrelated to Mr. Trump’s order. But by Tuesday night, his uncorrected posting had racked up more than 251, 000 reactions, 68, 000 shares and 15, 000 comments, many by fans who see Kuwait’s supposed decision to follow Mr. Trump as a vindication of the president’s policy. “So you mean to tell me Muslims are banning Muslims from certain countries?” a user wrote under the name Christina Villar. “Then we have some Americans thinking our president is heartless. No, he is smart!” The White House did not respond on Tuesday night to a request for comment on Mr. Trump’s remarks. The internet has long been home to countless sites of dubious credibility, and the Arab world is full of news sites bankrolled by private parties to promote their interests. Historically, their audiences have been limited. But in this case, false information, based on a mistake from a   news source, was trumpeted to a vast audience by an American president who is prone to exaggeration and falsehoods, whose immigration policy is under fire, and whose administration has promoted the term “alternative facts. ” That exposure has shocked, and pleased, some who published the false information. “It has been quite staggering,” said Dina Dabbous, the   editor in chief of Albawaba, the   website whose link Mr. Trump shared. “We were quite satisfied, smugly, with that particular piece. ” But the site has since corrected the article on its website. The spreading of articles about the old Kuwait visa ban began last week, after Mr. Trump signed an executive order blocking citizens from seven   countries from entering the United States. As chaos spread at airports and opponents mounted legal challenges to the order, an editor working the night shift at The New Arab, a news site based in London, came across a report that Kuwait had announced a visa ban of its own on citizens from five   states. Keenly aware of the “justifiable international public interest,” the editor quickly wrote and published an article about the Kuwaiti ban without realizing that it was based on “a decision made in 2011,” according to a statement posted on the site on Tuesday after The New York Times inquired about the article’s origin. By the time the error was spotted and the article updated, the first, erroneous version had already spread. “Mistakes happen and unfortunately we found ourselves in a situation where a serious mistake like this (for which the member of staff has been disciplined) went viral,” the site’s statement said. The New Arab called its mistake “a solitary aberration from our usually excellent coverage. ” Because of a syndication agreement, the erroneous article appeared on Albawaba on the same day it was published by The New Arab. On Albawaba, the headline read, “Kuwait issues its own   visa ban for five   countries. ” That article caught international attention, and a number of sites that often defend Mr. Trump’s policies ran their own versions of it. Breitbart News, whose former chairman, Stephen K. Bannon, is now Mr. Trump’s chief strategist, said concerns about “radical Islamic terrorism” had prompted Kuwait to impose the ban. Infowars. com published a version that said Kuwait was worried about “possible migration of radical Islamic terrorists. ” Sputnik, a Russian   news agency that often  spreads disinformation, said Kuwait had “ripped a page from the playbook of U. S. President Donald Trump” with its own visa ban. But indications soon surfaced that the article was wrong. Pakistan’s ambassador to Kuwait denied that a visa ban had been placed on Pakistanis. And on Feb. 3, Kuwait said in a statement on its state news service, KUNA, that it “categorically denied” that it had stopped issuing visas for some nationalities. By the time some of the sites that had published the erroneous information issued clarifications, noting the Kuwaiti denial, the articles on The New Arab and Albawaba topped the “most popular” lists on their sites, even though the articles were six days old. Mr. Brownsell, of The New Arab, said his site’s article had generated more traffic than most of its articles, although he declined to give numbers. “It is safe to say more than usual,” he said. Albawaba issued a statement, also after an inquiry from The Times, saying its article had highlighted how hard it is for people from Syria and other countries to obtain visas to Kuwait, even if there is no official blanket ban. “President Trump, you’re not wrong here!” the statement from Albawaba said. “Our only fault was to call it a visa ban when it should behoove us to call it extreme vetting, or maybe even a ban with few exceptions. ” Ms. Dabbous, the editor at Albawaba, said in a phone interview on Tuesday that the article had served the site’s goal of airing “some of the truths about the Middle East that are narratives that you don’t often see. ” She was unconcerned that her site had kept the erroneous article shared by Mr. Trump up for six days. “With this one, we didn’t consider it all that wrong because we just think it exposes other truths,” she said.	1

A former member of the Netherlands criminal drug syndicate known as Octopus testified that victims were obtained for these human hunting parties from juvenile detention centers in Belgium and Holland. “In 2004 I was an involuntary witness to torture, rape and murder sessions of drugged children performed for a group of high ranked people of the Netherlands” stated a woman. “I was taken to a hunting party in Belgium close to Brussels where I saw two boys and a girl ages 14 to 16 hunted and killed by global elites. The human hunting party was heavily guarded by the Netherlands Royal Guards. I was told that King Albert of Belgium was present.”Four eyewitnesses confirmed that as children and youths they were forced to attend human hunting parties where they and other children were raped, with some killed, and deceased boy’s penises were cut off. Allegedly there was a Dutch countryside palace where boys’ penises were displayed like trophies on a wall. Some hunting parties were hosted on the grounds of Belgium Queen Beatrix’s Palace. The International Tribunal into Crimes of Church and State (or ITCCS) is a one-man blog that pretends to be a tribunal established to enforce common law. Despite claims of being based in Brussels, the whole thing is written in Canada by Kevin D. Annett, a defrocked United Church of Canada minister.At the heart of the “organization” is something Annett calls the International Common Law Court of Justice (ICLCJ), which is rather similar to those “common law courts” sometimes set up by freemen-on-the-land, right down to the “citizen jurors”. This court exists only on Annett’s blog.With the ITCCS, Annett attempts to mimic genuine international organisations, and is actually good enough at this to have fooled a few normal people (and a lot of raving conspiracy-prone nutters) into thinking there’s anything at all to this. He produces very nicely-formatted, official-looking documents and everything. Annett has “convicted” two consecutive Popes of genocide and child trafficking, issuing “international arrest warrants” for them. He has also issued a proclamation dissolving Canada, which he has replaced with the Republic of Kanata.	0
283	BEIT HANOUN, Gaza Strip  —   In her new home, finally finished after she lived two years in a trailer across a dirt road, Samaher   40, showed a video on her cellphone of a cute preschooler: her son Majdi. He was singing: “I am a son of Palestine, I have a right and a cause   …     Even if they shoot me and I die as a martyr, I will not forget the cause. ” Majdi, who was 6, lived through two Gazan wars, though his old family house was toppled by bulldozers in the 2014 fighting with Israel. But the day after he ended kindergarten last year, he caught his hula hoop in a metal door in the trailer. The door was heavy, the frame shoddy. It fell on him and crushed his skull, killing him. “Something is missing,” his mother said eight months later, in the living room of her house, built on the   plot of the old one. “You asked me if this is better. Yes, it’s better. But I’m missing him. His bedroom was waiting for him. ” So it is in Gaza, outwardly rebuilding and moving on from war, inwardly far from recovered. Gaza seems at a loss for what might be next. After so many years of isolation, residents of Gaza find themselves ever further from Palestinians in the West Bank, their future clouded by rising doubts that they could ever unite and work toward a lasting peace. Two million tons of rubble have been cleared  —   about a ton for each person who lives in this cramped coastal strip.   of the 160, 000 damaged homes have been rebuilt, as have half of the 11, 000 that were destroyed. Roads are better, travel faster. People gawk at their first real mall, with a food court and 12 escalators, both rarities in Gaza. But they are not buying much. Unemployment is high, especially among the many young people graduating from college. In all, 50, 000 people remain displaced. Electricity and water supplies are still near crisis levels. Hamas, which governs Gaza, elected a new   leader. Tunnel building goes on (and, presumably, so does the construction and smuggling of weapons). On the Israeli side, the political right talks of a new war in the spring over Hamas’s rearming and expresses a desire to inflict a decisive blow. As has been the case for a decade, the strip remains encircled. Israel tightly controls most going in and out: food, building supplies, people. Two children died recently for lack of drugs or medical access, one of cancer, the other of a heart problem. “The blockade of Gaza is something I can compare to the Middle Ages and the besieged castle that can fall at any moment,” said Dr. Fadel Ashour, a psychiatrist in Gaza since 1994. “People in Gaza are not satisfied with who governs this castle. They lack the tools to change it. They live with armed militias, and the institutions are not clear as they are in the West Bank. They know they are paying a price for something they don’t want. Or deserve. This increases their depression and hopelessness. ” It is unclear how the flickers of change elsewhere in the   conflict will ripple to Gaza, which is surrounded by Israel on two sides, by Egypt to the southwest and by the Mediterranean. With President Trump in office in the United States, Israel’s right seems to feel empowered and is likely to push more settlements in the West Bank, even to toy with annexation, despite Mr. Trump’s call to slow the pace. The Palestinian Authority, which has wide backing in the West, seems to be looking abroad for ways to push its immediate future, including persuading the world to recognize a state of Palestine, threatening action in the United Nations and encouraging Israeli boycotts. Leaders of Hamas, considered a terrorist group by the United States and by many other countries, do not have the same backing from the West. Interviews with political and business leaders, academics and ordinary people can divine only a basic strategy: improve the lives of frustrated residents as its leaders put off as long as possible what they see as the next inevitable war, then fight when it happens. (Life could be better, Hamas’s critics contend, if the group spent less on war preparations.) Mahmoud Zahar, a senior Hamas official, said that with years of failed talks, settlements expanding across the West Bank and Mr. Trump’s apparent ambivalence about a Palestinian state, “You have two options: either to cooperate with the occupation or the resistance. There is no option,” he said. “Where is the   solution?” Interviews make it clear that there is a growing distance between Gaza and the West Bank  —   a central reason cited by Israelis for the impossibility of negotiations. Hamas won Palestinian parliamentary elections in 2006 and took control of Gaza in 2007. “Now, Gaza is something and the West Bank is something else,” said Ibrahim   a columnist for the   news outlet Al Risala. “It’s a fact. You can’t connect the two realities. You will get lost. Things have changed. ” Mr. Madhoun and several others raised a possibility, a very long shot, one that could conceivably be acceptable to Israel’s far right: Someday Gaza  —   with defined borders, no Israeli occupation and no settlers  —   could become the basis for a Palestinian state as settlements gnaw away at the West Bank. “If there is going to be a Palestinian state, it’s going to be Gaza,” said Mkhaimar Abusada, associate professor of political science at   University in Gaza. “Politically speaking, it’s not right. But this is what’s coming. ” Otherwise, he said, “I don’t think there is a grand strategy where Gaza is in 10 years or 20 years. I know Hamas will never want to give up Gaza as long as it is capable of keeping control. ” Residents say they are focusing on getting by. Industrious and, for the most part, educated, they have cleared and rebuilt to the point that in places it is hard to tell there have been three wars in six years. One giveaway is that the concrete on the houses is fresh dark gray, rather than   and weathered. Qatar and Saudi Arabia have underwritten minicities, as caravans and tents slowly empty. The Islamic University has patched the two buildings bombed in two wars and, with great effort, installed an impressive array of 450 solar panels on the science building, even though there is a fear the panels and the building might make a big target in the next war. Capital Mall opened in January, with four floors of upscale shops. One woman lifted her niqab briefly for a photo in front of a Valentine’s Day flower display. Another posed for her husband, who is in an Israeli jail. “I feel happy here,” Sana Shanghan, 50, said, visiting with some of her 13 children. “Here, I feel I’m outside Gaza. I forget about Gaza’s problems. ” The feeling was similar inside the steamy domes of Hamam   Gaza’s only remaining bathhouse, heated with olive wood and, its owners say, predating Islam’s arrival over a millennium ago. “People are tired, kids and old people,” said Salim Abdullah   66, who runs the house for his family. “More and more come here for psychological support. ” He added: “There is no progress. It’s just survival. ” Mona Ghalayini is betting on more than just survival. One of Gaza’s few businesswomen, Ms. Ghalayini, 46, has built a small empire that began with a   shop in 2003. For most people in Gaza, the sea is simply a place where fishermen work waters constricted by Israeli patrol boats. But she sees potential in the current stability, recently buying two seaside hotels. “We have brains,” she said, inhaling from a shisha on the patio of one of her hotels. “We have smart people. We can survive, even with the blockade. But we need connection. We don’t want isolation. ” Tourism is the future, she said. Then she reconsidered. “Who visits Gaza?” she asked. “No one. ”	1

446	“He’s either going to be fantastic  —   or dead. ” That was the verdict of some of opera’s keenest vocal judges a decade ago when they awarded Michael Fabiano, an explosively talented tenor who was 22 at the time and pushing himself hard, a   win at the 2007 Metropolitan Opera National Council Auditions. A decade later, he is one of the most exciting,   singers in the world  —   but the fatalistic warning was still ringing in my ears a few Sundays ago when Mr. Fabiano, who likes to pilot planes on his days off, took me for a flight. As we buckled into a small Piper Archer at Essex County Airport in New Jersey, near his childhood home, Mr. Fabiano rattled off a battery of safety instructions that went well beyond the usual flight attendant script: where to find the fire extinguisher, how to brace yourself over the instrument panel if necessary, how to unlatch the door in case of a crash landing. He cried “Clear prop!” then started the propeller, and up we went. I found myself wondering if I would have felt safer flown by a singer who was not quite as   for    —   or perhaps by a baritone, or anyone other than an impassioned tenor. “Safe never wins,” Mr. Fabiano, 32, said in an interview, explaining the philosophy that has guided everything from his choice of roles to his decision to act on a lifelong dream and get his pilot’s license, despite the dangers. “I’m very, very big on preparation. I take prepared gambles. ” These are heady days for Mr. Fabiano, whose voice abounds in the     pinging quality opera buffs sometimes call “squillo. ” He is currently singing in Verdi’s “La Traviata” at the Met opposite the soprano Sonya Yoncheva, a production that will be simulcast to cinemas around the world on March 11. This summer he will sing his first Don José in Bizet’s “Carmen” in a new staging at the    Festival in France. And, in a sign of his arrival as an international star, he will open the   season at the Royal Opera House in London, in a production to be announced next month. But at nearly every step, Mr. Fabiano has been dogged by questions like the ones that the National Council judges raised a decade ago  —   about whether he was biting off too much, too soon. It is a dilemma many young singers face: Push hard and risk damaging your voice, or err on the side of caution and chance missing your moment. I witnessed one of his more remarkable gambles two years ago. The Met phoned him one afternoon while he was home in Philadelphia and asked if he would step in for an ailing tenor in Donizetti’s “Lucia di Lammermoor” six and a half hours later, in a staging he had never seen, let alone rehearsed. I happened to be at the opera house that day reporting another article. Despite the pressure he was facing  —   he had zipped up on Amtrak  —   he let me tag along as he got hastily fitted for costumes and raced through a battery of   rehearsals. By 11:05 p. m. he was basking in a standing ovation, and nursing a head wound from a cut he got exiting the stage. His exploit made international news. Reminded of the old “fantastic or dead” paths suggested by the National Council judges (in a scene captured in “The Audition,” a documentary about the competition) Peter Gelb, the Met’s general manager, said, “He seems to have gone towards the fantastic. ” Mr. Gelb’s plans include mounting a revival of Verdi’s “I Lombardi,” which Mr. Fabiano has sung to tumultuous acclaim, for him in the   season. “Everyone wants to be the next Domingo,” Mr. Gelb said. “The question for him is being careful and selective, and not blowing his voice out by taking on roles that are too much for him. ” As the plane floated above New Jersey, the Willowbrook Mall visible down below, Mr. Fabiano turned toward Lincoln Park, where he lived as a child. “Do you see that red roof?” he asked, gesturing down below. “That was my home. ” Opera was not always in the cards for Mr. Fabiano, whose family moved to Minnesota when he was 11, but whose accent is still more Jersey than Twin Cities. He comes from a musical family  —   an aunt was an opera singer  —   and he sang in high school, but as a teenager he was more interested in debate, mock trial and being a baseball umpire. (Mr. Fabiano, who cuts a trim, muscular figure now, took to umpiring rather than playing in part because he was overweight in his youth he shed 80 pounds the year he turned 20.) It was not until he got into the University of Michigan and began studying with George Shirley, a tenor who was one of the first   men to sing leading roles at the Met in the 1960s, that he became serious about singing. Mr. Shirley said that Mr. Fabiano was on a fast track from the start. “He sings with such passion  —   that’s one of the things that makes people concerned,” he said in a telephone interview. “Because whatever Michael does, it’s 3, 000 percent. There’s no backing off. That’s his personality. But so far, so good. He walks to the beat of his own drummer, and so far, the beat is solid. ” Some of Mr. Fabiano’s advisers warned him against taking on the taxing title role in Verdi’s “Don Carlo” last season at the San Francisco Opera, one of his main artistic homes in recent years. But he studied the role for three and a half years and nailed it. During the run last June, we got together at the Presidio, at a favorite spot of his overlooking the Pacific Ocean. “I always think that the great performances are the performances where you think a singer is going right to the edge,” said Mr. Fabiano, who will return to San Francisco next season to star in Massenet’s “Manon,” opposite Nadine Sierra. “When a singer has gone right to the edge, either they just make it or they break slightly and you think, that’s it. ” A dramatic fog rolled in off the ocean as we spoke. Then we headed back to the War Memorial Opera House in his black BMW Mr. Fabiano, who is on the road 11 months a year, had it shipped across country as a taste of home. As the traffic thickened, he began aggressively weaving in and out, explaining that he did not believe in defensive driving. “There are a lot of defensive singers,” he said, a dismissive edge in his voice, “who pursue their careers defensively. ” These are tricky times for an    opera star. Many companies are struggling financially singers’ fees have been cut in many places the recording industry is not what it was. Mr. Fabiano said that when he decided to make opera his career, he carefully mapped out the steps he needed to succeed. “I felt like a businessman, not like an artist,” he said. “I know so many people don’t want to hear that. I’m a businessman at the core. ” Some gambles paid off, some did not  —   looking back, he said, it was a mistake to sing at the Teatro alla Scala in Milan at 23, saying he was “too green” to make it a success. But he is constantly trying new things: Last fall, he and some friends started a foundation, ArtSmart, to give free voice lessons to teenagers who lack access. Its pilot program, at Newark East Side High School in New Jersey, reaches about a dozen students, and he plans to expand the program to Philadelphia and San Francisco. “We teach the kids any genre of music that they want to focus on,” he said, “but we do give them a base curriculum  —   stretching, breathing, vocal exercises, how to read music. ” We began our descent, the runway getting closer and closer. “Get down, honey,” he said, and a few seconds later the plane’s tires hit the tarmac.  “If I only listened to my elders and did exactly what they prescribed, I wouldn’t be who I am today,” he said, after the plane had taxied to a stop. “I might not be flying a plane, because most people told me it’s too dangerous to do, and you shouldn’t do it, and blah, blah, blah. Well, I love to fly. I will never take the careful route. ” “I don’t want to live a kind of cloistered life,” he added. “There are singers that can sing for 50 years, and there are singers that sing for 30. I’ll fall somewhere in between that. Maybe not at the high end, maybe not at the low. But somewhere. ”	1

408	DENVER  —   As Americans poured into airport terminals, public squares and congressional town   meetings over the past month to vent their anger over President Trump’s policies, Debbie Dooley started hearing from fellow conservatives. “Phone call after phone call from people: ‘Why aren’t we out supporting President Trump? ’” said Ms. Dooley, a Tea Party activist in Georgia. So on Monday, conservatives around the country got out the Make America Great Again hats, unfurled American flags and held rallies at state capitols and on courthouse steps, seeking to rekindle the populist fervor that helped vault Mr. Trump to the White House and stick up for a president whose approval ratings have taken a beating during five   weeks in office. But the modest crowds that showed up for the noontime rallies from New Jersey to Georgia to Colorado offered a reminder of what liberal groups learned eight years ago in the face of Tea Party anger at President Barack Obama: Stoking   energy is often easier for the outraged resistance than for the party pulling the levers in Washington. “I’m getting a lot of comments from the leftists about, ‘Your crowd’s not going to be as big as our crowd,’” said Betty Blanco, a retired teacher from La Junta, Colo. on the state’s conservative eastern plains, who organized a rally on the steps of the   State Capitol. “I didn’t know it was a contest. ” About 150 Trump supporters turned out for Monday’s rally in Denver, held just across the street from a park that had swelled with tens of thousands of protesters as part of the Women’s March on Jan. 21. Organizers said Monday’s rallies, held a day before the president addresses a joint session of Congress, bubbled up organically from Trump supporters who felt he was being treated unfairly by Democrats and the news media. Some people said the ferocity of that criticism had actually nudged them closer to Mr. Trump. “I was mad at Trump for a while, absolutely,” said Steve Foose, a bus driver in Middletown, N. J. and   former Democrat who joined about 200 people waving signs and flags along the curb of a   crossroads. “I just grew to like him, and I would lay down my life for him. ” Monday’s rallies were filled with prayer, choruses of “God Bless America” and speeches about cutting taxes and regulations. People applauded the president and veterans, and urged one another to stay positive. But there were also chants of “Lock her up!” every so often, and a few shouting matches when Trump critics wandered by and yelled at the crowds. People praised Mr. Trump for actions that have provoked protests and lawsuits from the left. In interviews at five rallies on Monday, his supporters said that he was breaking the china in Washington, cracking down on immigration and supporting American businesses, and that they were getting frustrated that more people did not seem to see it that way. In Atlanta, Jermane Enoch, 57, a project manager from Powder Springs, Ga. was among the few   in a largely white crowd of 200 who rallied on the president’s behalf at Liberty Plaza, in the shadow of the State Capitol. Wearing a red Trump hat, a patriotic bow tie and a Trump   Mr. Enoch said that good businesspeople would understand why Monday’s rallies across the country were needed, given what he said was the “negative messaging” from   protesters and the news media. “It’s necessary to have a show of continuous support, just like it’s necessary for businesses to show continuous improvement,” he said. Mr. Enoch argued that the president had been mischaracterized and misunderstood. The idea that Mr. Trump is a racist, as some critics contend, struck him as balderdash. In a   turn at the microphone, Mr. Enoch said his support for Mr. Trump superseded race, and he urged a return to conservative values. Mr. Enoch brandished a pocket Constitution, to much applause. And he took a cue from Isaiah as he said Mr. Trump’s supporters should not be cowed by counterprotest: “I am not afraid!” he said. “No weapon that is formed against us shall prosper!” RICHARD FAUSSET In Mandeville, a city in one of Louisiana’s most conservative parishes, there was some question as to how many Trump supporters would materialize, this being the usually quiet eve of Mardi Gras. But there was little doubt that those who showed up  —   150 or so bikers, retirees,   police officers and others  —   would be   in their support for a president who won the parish by roughly three to one. A home remodeler and disc jockey who uses the name Bobby Blaze made the most   entrance, wearing a suit over his leather “Brotherhood of Bikers” vest, a bright red tie with a gold clip and, to top it all off, a   Trump wig. He said that his father, a World War II veteran who died two years ago, would have loved Mr. Trump: “‘The country needs John Wayne,’ that’s what he used to say. ” And after aiding its allies around the globe for decades, Mr. Blaze suggested, the United States had finally gotten such a   leader at a time when it needed him most. “We can’t help the world,” he said, “till we can help ourselves first. ” CAMPBELL ROBERTSON In Cabarrus County, N. C. which Mr. Trump easily carried, more than 150 of his supporters met up outside the courthouse in Concord, many of them unfurling last year’s Trump campaign flags, lawn signs and red caps  —   though a surprising number said they had never attended a Trump rally during the presidential race. Bill Cagle, a retiree, decided to attend on Monday after seeing a deluge of news coverage of   demonstrations in the streets and at congressional town halls. “I said, ‘Well, we’ve been silent long enough, and we’ve really got to say what’s in the heart,’ when I saw all of this vitriol the last six weeks,” Mr. Cagle said. An operations manager for a company that builds towers for   lines, Mr. Cagle said he was a registered Democrat but had not voted for the party’s presidential ticket in decades. He said he maintained his registration only to vote against what he considered the worst option in a primary race. “What he’s done in a little bit of time, I think is great,” he said of Mr. Trump, noting in particular his efforts to roll back regulations. “I’ve been in business, and by golly, if they can get rid of some of that, it’s great. ” TRIP GABRIEL On the edges of the Denver crowd, two men exemplified the devotion and the dread that the president inspires. Ron Kamstra, a retired civil engineer and   Christian who said he deeply supported Mr. Trump’s stances on terrorism and immigration, handed out photocopied passages of the Quran that he said encouraged violence. Mohamed Mashkooke, an accountant born in Somalia, wandered up to Mr. Kamstra and said he was growing increasingly worried about becoming the target of racist attacks  —   like the shooting last week of two Indian men in Kansas. Cordially at first, but then increasingly tensely, the men argued about religion, immigration, faith and the validity of Mr. Obama’s birth certificate. (Despite all of the facts, Mr. Kamstra is still dubious.) “I don’t hate Trump,” Mr. Mashkooke said finally, walking away, “but I think he’s crazy. ” “O. K. good,” Mr. Kamstra replied, and turned back to the speeches. JACK HEALY	1

351	BEVERLY HILLS, Calif.  —   As she made for her booth, tucked into a remote corner of the Blvd Lounge at the Beverly Wilshire Hotel here, Isabelle Huppert expertly dodged the furtive stares of a roomful of diners. She had arrived on the arm of her publicist, who vanished as discreetly as he had arrived, leaving Ms. Huppert on her own to sit with a reporter, sip her cappuccino and ponder a question: Is she vain? Brusquely, she picked up a knife, inspecting her reflection in its blade. “Is this what you mean?” she asked lightly, brushing aside a stray wisp of hair. Was she being coy? Hard to say. Ambiguity, after all, is Ms. Huppert’s stock in trade. It is part of the screen arsenal she has deployed in more than 100 films during the course of a   career, and it is central to her role in “Elle,” a   psychological thriller in which she, as the victim of a vicious rape, responds with an eerie admixture of horror and calm. Her performance, which earned her a best actress award at the Golden Globes in January, drew fresh waves of attention when she was nominated this month for an Academy Award, an honor she seems to regard with a mix of anxiety and cool entitlement. Would she bring home Oscar gold on Sunday night? “Yeah, it’s possible,” she ventured, adding definitively after a pause, “Yes, for me it’s time. ” That near boast, tempered by a flicker of amusement, hinted at the wickedly subversive streak that has made Ms. Huppert a muse to an international roster of directors, including Claude Chabrol, Otto Preminger, Bertrand Tavernier and Paul Verhoeven. Mr. Verhoeven, of “Basic Instinct” and “Showgirls” notoriety, directed Ms. Huppert in “Elle. ” Combined with an apparently uncontrived chic, that subversiveness has lately transformed Ms. Huppert, who is mostly known in the United States to an art house crowd, into a red carpet diva and the unlikely darling of the fashion set. Never mind that Ms. Huppert, 63, long married and the mother of three, plays a grandmother in “Elle. ” Or that in her native Paris she has long been a   fixture at Dior, Chanel and Armani. When the cameras closed in on her as she claimed her Globe, writers breathlessly anatomized every facet of her look. As the popular Who What Wear website effusively reported, “Her incredibly chic   top and skirt along with an earful of edgy Repossi ear cuffs have landed the actress on a number of best dressed lists and left the internet buzzing. ” The Fashion Law, another widely read blog, posted, “It is difficult not to notice that Huppert is becoming a favorite not only of critics and fashion industry insiders but of those on the periphery, as well. ” Adding her voice to the mix, Vanessa Friedman, the New York Times fashion critic, posted on Twitter on the night of the Globes, “Whoever made Isabelle Huppert’s dress should take credit ASAP. ” Ms. Huppert had selected that dress, Armani Privé, with care. “It’s important how personal and singular you feel in what you wear,” she said. “It’s important that you keep your own identity. ” Would she turn up again in Armani on Oscar night? “I might,” she offered playfully. Whether she is captured on camera in a   trouser suit, as she was at the Los Angeles Film Critics Association awards in January in a     Chloé gown at the British Academy Film Awards this month or in a pale blue trouser suit, snapped alongside Nicole Kidman on the day they received their Oscar nominations, Ms. Huppert projects a singular authority. “She has what the French used to call chien,” said Simon Doonan, the creative ambassador for Barneys New York. He was alluding to the blend of tough chic and barely concealed sensuality that, Mr. Doonan maintains, defines Ms. Huppert’s allure. And in viewing her image on Instagram, Ryan Lobo, a designer of the New York label Tome, responded with a single word: “Queen. ” On Instagram, Ms. Huppert is followed by no less a fashion personage than Nicolas Ghesquière, the creative director of Louis Vuitton. In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Jonathan Huguet, her stylist, summed up her appeal as a rare combination of masculine assurance and unexpected fragility. She is hardly indifferent to fashion, Mr. Huguet noted. “She knows her brands and designers,” he said. “She is completely open to different things. ” He added that she was happy to try a variety of fabrics, shapes and designers, among them Haider Ackermann and Maria Grazia Chiuri of Dior. Still, the style world’s renewed devotion has left Ms. Huppert nonplused. “After all,” she said, a bit disingenuously, “I’m not a fashion person. ” She had dressed for breakfast at the Beverly Wilshire in a crisply tailored jacket, its deep green and coral pattern setting off her   russet hair. Who designed the jacket? Her features furrowed briefly as she removed it to check the label, exclaiming with what seemed genuine surprise: “It’s J. Crew. Can you imagine?” The jacket, which she wore over a pale coral Chloé blouse and slim trousers, was consistent with a style Ms. Huppert has refined over time, a look that is mostly defined by slim trousers, tailored jackets and coats, understated evening wear, and the occasional provocative accent (those tiny Repossi cuffs snaking up her ear). Immaculately assembled as they may be, her ensembles are “worn with the effortlessness that Frenchwomen seem to naturally possess,” Allyson Payer of Who What Wear posted. It is the kind of assessment that Ms. Huppert is apt to greet with one of her ironic smiles. “Because I’m French, people have a certain idea of my style,” she said. “I’m not quite sure what that means. And not quite sure what it is that I’m supposed to represent. ” When she’s not acting, she said, “I don’t think of myself as carrying a specific image. ” But on camera, she added: “Every change of outfit can help you. It allows you to see yourself freshly each time, and each time with fresh potential. ” There are times, it seems, when Ms. Huppert is all potential, her aloof, sometimes opaque, expression  —   “resting bitch face,” as the fashion tribes would have it  —   acting as a potent draw. “It’s intrinsic to her, that certain enigmatic je ne sais quoi,” Mr. Doonan said. If her mystery tends to mesmerize devout fashionistas, it’s not for the first time. Ms. Huppert herself is well aware that she has long fascinated fashion photographers, among them Richard Avedon, Guy Bourdin, Helmut Newton, Hedi Slimane and their illustrious like. “Her face is like a window, it’s so transparent,” said Peter Lindbergh, who has shot her many times. “When you photograph people, often that window is closed. Some people let you in, but there is a limit. But Isabelle, she is like glass. ” She also has a chameleonlike quality that was captured in 2005 in a show of her portraits at MoMA PS1, subsequently gathered in book form, that volume, like the show, aptly titled, “Isabelle Huppert: Woman of Many Faces. ” Perhaps most famously, she posed,   for Newton wearing a white bathrobe that opened to expose a sliver of nipple, her expression in that instant a disconcerting blend of innocence and insolence. Her face, she knows, can be a difficult read. “Most of the time it is more like a white canvas on which you can project many things,” she said. “I wouldn’t say it’s inexpressive, but it is undefined enough that it can be shaped and defined by whoever looks at you. ” She laughed. “In the end something that could be seen as a fault turns out to be an advantage,” she said. However malleable her features, however vulnerable she may seem onscreen, Ms. Huppert wants you to know that ultimately she is the one in charge. “I play a role, but I don’t transform myself entirely,” she said. “The irony you see, the humor, the way of being cool, it’s me more than anyone else, I have to say. ” Some take it for perversity, a trait that has marked her since she appeared onscreen in the early 2000s as the   sadomasochistic antiheroine of the erotic thriller “The Piano Teacher. ” “What people call perverse and outside the margins, it has nothing to do with perversity,” Ms. Huppert said. “It’s more about doing one thing and maybe thinking another. That’s what we all do, and that’s what you see in me on film. ” Nor does she, in her acting, make an effort to seduce. “I’m not really interested in pleasing,” she said in her teasing contralto. “I think the best way to please is not to please. ” That refusal is one source of a sexual charisma that can defy analysis. “I don’t use the usual seductive tools,” Ms. Huppert said. “My sexuality is almost cerebral. It’s never, ‘Look at me, see how sexy I am. ’” On the screen she is permitted an erotic latitude not generally available to her contemporaries, in particular Meryl Streep, with whom she is often, if misguidedly, compared. As Michèle in “Elle,” Ms. Huppert pursues her own sexual agenda, whatever the cost. In a recent fashion feature in The Reporter, she comes off as a steamy,   vixen, aptly costumed in   black leather. She is also permitted a display of   that doesn’t quite square with the sexual hunger she is sometimes asked to portray on film. Some call it coldness  —   a Brechtian detachment, as Mr. Verhoeven remarked  —   or a chilly reflection of  . Does that translate to vanity? Ms. Huppert wondered, returning to a topic that she clearly finds absorbing. “If it does, I don’t care. ”	1

886	 I have been seeing Facebook posts about a Portland school that is banning peanut butter and jelly sandwiches because they are racist. Can you shed some light on this sandwich dilemma?Peanut Butter and Jelly Sandwich Racist, Warns Portland School Official http://t.co/kmhpzFPaFq— Marco Martoccia (@sheet_metal) June 26, 2015Somebody explain to me how Peanut Butter and Jelly sandwiches are racist. Please. I'm very interested in knowing.— DJ GOT1 (@ItB_LikeThat) June 26, 2015https://twitter.com/katmarg7/status/613863915521503232 Oh the times we live in where food can be deemed racist. In a move Oprah would be proud of, Principal Verenice Gutierrez, of the Harvey Scott K-8 School in Portland, has labeled peanut butter and jelly sandwiches as racist.It’s bread. It can’t use racial slurs, it can’t discriminate and it’s crucial in making a PB&J. I guess I have to go to the store and pick up some wheat bread now to promote loaf diversity in my kitchen. Verenice Gutierrez picks up on the subtle language of racism every day.Take the peanut butter sandwich, a seemingly innocent example a teacher used in a lesson last school year.“What about Somali or Hispanic students, who might not eat sandwiches?” says Gutierrez, principal at Harvey Scott K-8 School, a diverse school of 500 students in Northeast Portland’s Cully neighborhood.“Another way would be to say: ‘Americans eat peanut butter and jelly, do you have anything like that?’ Let them tell you. Maybe they eat torta. Or pita.“ In addition to teaching that peanut butter and jelly sandwiches are racist, PEG trains educators to view “rugged individualism,” “adherence to rigid time schedules,” and the belief that “hard work is the key to success” as traits of the dominant white culture.We wonder how taxpayers will react when they discover Portland officials are wasting precious time and money to promote an ideology that may soon classify peanut butter and jelly sandwiches as a “hate food.”	0

92	WASHINGTON  —   Republican congressional aides have set their iPhones to flutter every time President Trump hurls a thunderbolt on Twitter. Senators nod politely at his false claims of mass voter fraud during private White House meetings. The congressional morning briefing literature now includes a rundown of overnight and   social media missives from the commander in chief. “It doesn’t take that long to read ’em,” said Senator Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee. After three weeks in the White House, Mr. Trump has made clear that he is going to continue promulgating conspiracy theories, flinging personal insults and saying things that are plainly untrue. And the   House and Senate seem to have made a collective decision: They will accommodate  —   not confront  —   his conduct as long as he signs their   conservative proposals on taxes, regulations and health care into law. “There’s a widely held view among our members that, yes, he’s going to say things on a daily basis that we’re not going to like,” said Senator John Thune of South Dakota, the   Senate Republican, “but that the broad legislative agenda and goals that we have  —   if we can stay focused on those and try and get that stuff enacted  —   those would be big wins. ” Such accommodation is coming at a price, attracting incredulous or angry constituents to town hall meetings, leaving members   when presented with the latest presidential provocation and testing the capacity of now perpetually clogged phone lines on Capitol Hill. Some of this would have happened under any Republican president  —   lawmakers were quick to note the ferocity of protests under President George W. Bush. But much of it is unique to Mr. Trump, whose rampaging presidency has spurred uncommon civic engagement even in   districts. “What is your line in the sand?” a retired Utah teacher demanded last week of Representative Jason Chaffetz, the Republican chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, who slogged through a   forum back home. But at least for now, that is a price Republicans seem willing to pay. In effect, congressional Republicans have sought to compartmentalize Mr. Trump’s presidency, adopting a   approach. They reach for the more appealing offerings, such as the Supreme Court nominee, Judge Neil M. Gorsuch, and avert their gaze from less appetizing or, to some, downright indefensible elements (America is not so different from Vladimir V. Putin’s Russia) which would have surely drawn relentless rebukes if uttered by President Barack Obama. Some lawmakers take comfort knowing that the president’s behavior last year didn’t hurt their campaigns, and they have used the electoral result as a justification unto itself, suggesting  —   as Mr. Trump has constantly  —   that his campaign success validates his approach. “He’s a unique personality, to be sure,” acknowledged Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the Republican whip. “But he’s gotten this far the way he is, and I think that probably leads him to think, well, it’s working for him so far, so why change?” And Republican lawmakers do not mind? “As long as we’re able to get things done,” Mr. Cornyn said. Individual Republican senators have criticized the president in mostly isolated cases, none more vocally than Senator John McCain of Arizona, who blasted the president’s comparison between Mr. Putin’s extrajudicial killings and American conduct, and recently expressed concerns about a military raid in Yemen that resulted in the death of an American commando and multiple civilians. Often, the president has taken note  —   in brushback pitches that serve as warnings, if not to Mr. McCain, then to lawmakers who might emulate him. “He’s been losing so long he doesn’t know how to win anymore,” Mr. Trump wrote of Mr. McCain on Twitter on Thursday morning, calling to mind Mr. Trump’s suggestion during the campaign that Mr. McCain was not a war hero because he had been captured in combat. Hours later, Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, went to the Senate floor and lamented the attacks on Mr. McCain and other Republicans. Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, then followed  —   and seemed far less bothered. “I personally wish he would choose his words a little more carefully,” Mr. Hatch said of the president. “On the other hand, I kind of find him refreshing, that he doesn’t take any guff from anybody. ” Privately, lawmakers and members of their staffs have pleaded with Mr. Trump’s inner circle for more discipline from the president and his White House. “We might talk to the vice president, but certainly not for public attribution,” Mr. Cornyn said of Vice President Mike Pence, who joins Senate Republicans once a week at their regular luncheons in the Capitol. By and large, though, Republicans in Congress are treating Mr. Trump as an individual to be worked around in his own administration. “I think we can get a lot done with the people around him,” Mr. McCain said, dismissing policy pronouncements from Mr. Trump that often differ from “the day before. ” Practically patting Mr. Trump on the head, Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee, said, “If he pays attention to people like General Kelly when he’s doing a travel restriction and if he appoints people like Neil Gorsuch when he’s making appointments, he’ll be rewarded for that by all the praise, and maybe he’ll do more of it. ” (Former Gen. John F. Kelly is the Homeland Security secretary.) In hopes of repairing their relationship with Congress after the botched rollout of the travel ban, Mr. Trump’s aides have aggressively courted congressional Republicans. In addition to Mr. Pence with his weekly visits, Marc Short, Mr. Trump’s chief legislative liaison, has already become ubiquitous in the Capitol. And powerful senators are enjoying significant attention: Mr. McCain, the Armed Services Committee chairman, said he had already had three conversations with Michael T. Flynn, the national security adviser, and a breakfast with Jim Mattis, the defense secretary. Mr. Hatch, who is chairman of the Finance Committee, had a   meeting with Mr. Trump in the White House. And Mr. Alexander, the chairman of the health and education panel, was invited to the White House last Thursday for lunch with Mr. Trump. Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, said there was “a high level of satisfaction” with the new White House, insisting that members cared little about “the daily tweets. ” The deflection is bicameral. When a reporter recently noted that the House speaker, Paul D. Ryan, had often declined to weigh in on the “tweet of the day,” Mr. Ryan lit up. “You got my talking points down already!” he said, before gently fielding a question about Mr. Trump’s attacks on the federal judge who halted his travel ban. “Look, he’s not the first president to get frustrated with a ruling from a court,” Mr. Ryan said with a shrug. While the détente between an   president and its   leaders on Capitol Hill may seem wholly transactional, some Republicans say the fury on the left toward Mr. Trump along with the denunciations from many news outlets has helped forge his bond with the voters that he and congressional Republicans share, particularly in the   House. When the president addressed congressional Republicans at their retreat in Philadelphia last month, Mr. Trump’s aside about news coverage  —   “nothing fair about the media,” he said with a sneer  —   earned perhaps the most enthusiastic applause. “While it may upset The New York Times, Hollywood, the cast of ‘Hamilton’ and the groups marching in the streets, it is not upsetting to the constituents that elected these members and senators,” Sam Geduldig, a Republican lobbyist, said of Mr. Trump’s behavior. “There is a feeling that if those groups are against you, you’re doing the right thing. ” More skeptical Republicans believe that lawmakers are deluding themselves if they treat Mr. Trump as a normal president  —   quirky but tolerable, like a colorful uncle at Thanksgiving dinner. “They’re mostly ignoring him, humoring him occasionally while the rest of the family gets along fine, enjoys the turkey and watches the game,” said William Kristol, the former editor of The Weekly Standard. “But he’s not just a bit player or a guest. He’s the president. ” And in the Capitol, he can never be ignored for long. Strolling to a meeting last week, Mr. Corker was asked about the latest Trump controversy: The president had just attacked the retailer Nordstrom for dropping his daughter Ivanka’s accessories and clothing line. The senator flashed a broad smile. “Did he really?” he asked.	1
473	Truth is, no one can really replace Beyoncé. But at Coachella this year, Lady Gaga will take her spot. The festival announced late Tuesday that Lady Gaga would perform instead of Beyoncé on the second night of its   event in Indio, Calif. over two successive weekends, April   and    —   giving Lady Gaga a headlining spot at the biggest and most influential American music festival just two months after she performed for 117. 5 million viewers at the Super Bowl halftime show. This year’s festival will also be headlined by Radiohead and Kendrick Lamar. Beyoncé, who is pregnant with twins, announced last Thursday that she was dropping out of this year’s event “following the advice of her doctors,” news that drew lots of devastated tweets from her fans and a sharp price drop for Coachella tickets on the scalping market. (She is to return as a headliner next year.) A number of major acts had been rumored as possible replacements for Beyoncé, including Rihanna, Chance the Rapper, Daft Punk and even Jay Z, her husband. But the selection of Lady Gaga preserves at least one aspect of Beyoncé’s booking: a major female pop star known for playing to the crowds with a big, choreographed production, something entirely new to the Coachella stage.	1
123	If you’ve received a bouquet from that special someone this Valentine’s Day, Mother’s Day, or any other special occasion, you may be looking for ways to extend the gesture as long as possible. Just like hangover cures, there are many theories about the best method for keeping flowers fresh. I wanted to find out if one method reigned above all. So I asked some flower experts and tried my own (not very scientific) homegrown experiment. To start, I bought nine stalks of chrysanthemums from a grocery store and put each stalk in a clean glass bottle with about 12 ounces of warm water and the following common treatments: • Water alone • Water and putting flowers in a refrigerator every night • Sprite (¼ cup) and water • Vinegar (1 tbsp.) sugar (1 tbsp.) and water • Vodka (⅛ tsp.) sugar (1 tsp.) and water • Aspirin (1 crushed) and water • Penny, sugar (1 tsp.) and water • Bleach (2 drops) sugar (1 tsp.) and water • Flower food (½ packet) and water There’s some science behind these methods. But a word of caution before you try one: That little packet of flower food that came with the flowers may be your best bet. It likely has the right blend of antibacterial agents, a sugar source for food and an acidifier that will extend the life of your arrangement. “The problem with home remedies is it’s difficult to get the proportions right  —   put in too much bleach, and you might kill your flowers,” said Mary Hockenberry Meyer, a professor of horticulture at the University of Minnesota. But if you didn’t get one of those packets  —   or if you are harvesting flowers straight from the garden  —   here are some things you should know. Let’s rewind first, to the moment you receive a fresh bouquet. Before you even put your flowers in water, there are a couple of things you should do. If you’re using an old vase, wash it thoroughly because “whatever’s left over from your last batch of flowers has a lot of bacteria in it,” said Chris Wien, a professor emeritus of horticulture at Cornell University. Those bacteria block water flow in the flowers’ stems, causing your blooms to wilt sooner. Right away, cut off half an inch to an inch of the stems at a diagonal, using sharp scissors or a knife. Make sure to cut “in a tub or under running water, which prevents air bubbles from getting into the stems and blocking the flow of water,” said Amy Jo Detweiler, an associate professor of horticulture at Oregon State University. Remove any leaves or florets that would sit in the water, because those will cause bacterial buildup. Ideally, you should first put your flowers in water around 110 degrees (and your additives, of choice) and then keep the vase in a cool place for at least a couple of hours. This process, called “hardening” or “conditioning,” helps because warm water molecules move up the stems more quickly, while a cool environment minimizes water loss through the flowers’ petals and leaves. Though you might intuitively want to place flowers by a window, direct sunlight can actually stress cut flowers more than helping them  —   remember, your blossoms are not really photosynthesizing anymore so they don’t need sun to make food. Normal indoor lighting works just fine. Change the water at least once a week, recutting the stems and adding more preservative or food each time. In total, I kept my flowers for 10 days. Every day I randomly shuffled the flowers around, to ensure that positioning wouldn’t explain the outcomes. On Day 5, I fully replaced the water and treatments for each vase. So how did my treatments fare? In theory, soda, vinegar and aspirin should acidify the water so it more closely resembles the sap inside plant cells, helping the flowers take up fluid more easily. Vodka is thought to inhibit the production of ethylene, a gaseous hormone that causes flowers to mature and fruits to ripen. Copper, bleach and vinegar are antibacterial, and refrigerating should slow water loss and the breakdown of tissues. By far, the worst performers were aspirin and vinegar with added sugar. Flowers in the aspirin solution started wilting just four days in, while flowers in vinegar and sugar started wilting on Day 6. The aspirin treatment likely failed because it lacked sugar, and the vinegar treatment may have contained too much acid, said Neil Anderson, a professor of horticulture at the University of Minnesota. “For the water volume you used, you’d maybe want a teaspoon of vinegar at most. ” Though the flowers in the Sprite treatment stayed healthy, the solution had spots of fungus on its surface, which was not surprising because it contained a lot of sugar but no antibacterial ingredients. The flowers in the penny solution also looked good, though the water appeared slightly cloudy, likely because the copper didn’t dissolve enough to provide any antimicrobial effects. “It’s a great psychological remedy, perhaps,” said Dr. Wien. While the bouquets in aspirin and vinegar sagged, all the other flowers appeared robust, even in plain water. That may show the best way to ensure your blooms last longer: Get a resilient flower. Without realizing it, I had chosen one of the hardiest flowers for my experiment. This kind of chrysanthemum will probably live at least two weeks in the vase, and “you will not see a difference in any treatment,” Dr. Meyer predicted when I talked to her on Day 5 of my experiment. Because of genetic differences, certain flowers  —   like chrysanthemums and carnations  —   simply last longer than others, Dr. Anderson said. Though roses are a favorite for Valentine’s Day, they usually don’t last longer than a week, he added, a bit shorter than many other flowers. “Their petals aren’t as tough and waxy, so they lose a lot of water and wilt fast. ” Of course, even if you pull out all the stops, you won’t be able to ward off the inevitable. So, smell your roses while they last.	1

The move, which caught everyone including Bill Cosby off guard, takes effect immediately. Even though the evidence was strong, President Obama felt compelled to pardon the famous comedian of all current and future charges.The Scooper reached out to Mr. Cosby for comment, but we were provided with the following press release.“I know people are tired of me not saying anything, but a guy doesn’t have to answer to innuendos. People should fact check. People shouldn’t have to go through that and shouldn’t answer to innuendos. And just because I’ve received a Presidential pardon, doesn’t mean I’m guilty of anything. To the contrary, it shows I’m innocent.” This website is satirical in scope and intent. It provides fake news and social criticism in a satirical setting.

288	Regardless of what Congress ends up doing about the future of the tax system, you don’t need to pay more than you owe for the 2016 tax filing season. You can probably whittle your liability by going through last year’s records and checking to see if tips from tax professionals may apply to you. Whether you use a professional tax preparer or software, or handle the return on your own, you will need to assemble information and gather receipts and tax documents. Here are the basics: You need to track your income, but you are likely to get plenty of help on that. Be prepared for a blizzard of tax forms. Employers issue Forms   to employees. Banks, brokerage houses and other payers, including businesses that use independent contractors, issue Forms 1099 and sometimes Schedules   reporting the money they paid. They must report these payments to the I. R. S. as well, and discrepancies are likely to result in an I. R. S. notice. But it is up to the taxpayer to claim itemized deductions and available tax credits. If you neglect to do so, you may end up overpaying. Taking deductions requires good  . Consider the rules for charitable deductions on donated money, household items or clothing, valuable art or properties. Sidney Kess, a New York accountant and lawyer, who is a senior consultant to the accounting firm Citrin Cooperman, said your own check is sufficient for gifts of less than $250, but for higher amounts a receipt from the charity is needed. “To claim a deduction for items or property worth over $500 but less than $5, 000, in addition to a written acknowledgment, records have to show when and how you got the property, the cost or other basis, and you must report this information on Form 8283,” Mr. Kess said. “For a deduction over $5, 000, you need an appraisal from a qualified appraiser. ” But   is only part of what confronts taxpayers trying to reduce liabilities. The tax code  —   four million words by some estimates  —   is   of complexities, but therein lie opportunities. Mr. Kess discussed one such opportunity: deciding how family members should file their returns. Like so much involving taxes, it’s complicated. Say a couple has a daughter in college who earned money from a summer job. The couple provides more than half her support and could claim her as a dependent, but the I. R. S. imposes certain limits. Personal exemptions, which exclude $4, 050 per person from income, begin to phase out for married couples filing jointly with adjusted gross income of $311, 300 and are eliminated when income reaches $433, 800. If the parents had an income below those levels, they would probably have claimed their daughter as a dependent. Because their income is above the upper limit, they do not do so. Instead, she claims her own exemption on her return reporting her summer income, and she can take an education credit as well. Her parents could not get that credit because of their high income. Individual Retirement Accounts and Health Savings Accounts can be used to shelter tax refunds, noted Barbara Weltman, a lawyer in Vero Beach, Fla. and author of two J. K. Lasser books, “1001 Deductions  Tax Breaks 2017,” and “Small Business Taxes 2017,” both published by Wiley. “You can use your tax refund to lower your 2016 tax,” Ms. Weltman said, “but you have to file as early as you can” because the deadline for depositing the money into an I. R. A. or H. S. A. is the same as the due date for filing tax returns, April 18 this year. If you are eligible for an I. R. A. or H. S. A. claim deductions for them on the return, based on the amounts calculated by the accounts’ custodians, and include Form 8888, directing the I. R. S. to deposit those amounts directly into the accounts. Tell your account custodian (it may be a bank or a mutual fund company or a brokerage) that the deposit should be applied to 2016, she said. Any excess from the refund can go to your regular bank account. Julian Block, a tax lawyer in Larchmont, N. Y. said that big refunds can sometimes cause problems. He cited the case of a new client who, he discovered, had been receiving a plump refund every year. Mr. Block advised him to file a revised Form   with his employer, aimed at reducing the amount of money being held out of his regular paycheck and paring down his refund. The reason, Mr. Block said, is that online identity thieves are increasingly active, and if they file a fraudulent return using your Social Security number and claiming a refund, your own refund will be delayed while the I. R. S. sorts it out. Of course, you won’t be held liable for the actions of a thief. If, instead, you owe a small balance to the I. R. S. you won’t have that headache, though you will need to check whether your identity has been compromised in other areas of your financial life. Mr. Block also noted that there is an alternative to an I. R. A. for some older   people, including people who turn a hobby into a small business or do work like child care. If they are over age 70½, such people can no longer contribute to an I. R. A. but they can set up and contribute to a Simplified Employee Pension Plan. That enables them to deduct contributions now and withdraw money in later years. It will be taxable then, but their income may be lower, too. For tax purposes, alimony counts as earned income, he added, so recipients who otherwise qualify for an I. R. A. may contribute the alimony to it and claim a deduction. Many   people do not realize that they are allowed to deduct the cost of health insurance, regardless of whether their unreimbursed medical expenses are high enough to take a deduction on Schedule A, Mr. Block said. They can deduct the health insurance cost on the front of the Form 1040, on Line 29. That’s just one of several deductions on the front of the 1040 that are worth keeping in mind. Others include teachers’    outlays of up to $250 for students or for their own professional development, the deductible part of   tax, student loan interest, alimony paid and an H. S. A. deduction for those who are eligible. All are especially valuable because they reduce adjusted gross income on Line 37. That number ripples all through a tax return, often limiting other tax breaks. In addition to filing a 2016 return by April 18, many taxpayers must file Form   to pay quarterly estimated taxes on income on which no taxes are withheld, like   income interest, dividends and capital gains on investments, or rental and royalty income. Preparers often base the calculations on the previous year’s taxes, Mr. Kess said, but if tax cuts are indeed enacted by Congress, estimates based on 2016 taxes may turn out to be too high. If that happens, you will need to recalculate the estimate later  —   in June, September or even the end of the year, depending on when a law is enacted  —   and can reduce the payments accordingly. For anyone thinking, “I wish I’d known that last year,” Greg Rosica, a tax partner with EY, formerly Ernst  Young, in Tampa, Fla. says it’s probably not too late. Whatever the reason, you realize belatedly that you failed to take a deduction for which you were qualified. All is not lost. “It’s fairly simple to amend returns,” Mr. Rosica said. Taxpayers may file a Form 1040X up to three years beyond its original due date. Say you filed a Form 1040 for 2013 income in March 2014. The due date was April 15, 2014, so you have until April 18 this year. But if you filed under an automatic   extension in 2014, you have until Oct. 16 of this year to file the amended return. Mr. Rosica is a member of the editorial board for the “EY Tax Guide 2017,” which is published by Wiley, and includes this tip: Many taxpayers know they can deduct state income taxes on their federal return, but many do not realize they have the option of deducting sales taxes instead. That is advantageous if you live in a state like Texas, New Hampshire or South Dakota that has no state income tax. It may also be a boon to anyone who bought a   item like a car with a big sales tax, and is often the best choice for people over age 65 because many states  —   even   New York  —   exempt Social Security income and some   income from state income taxes. Both Mr. Rosica and Mr. Kess advised taxpayers to check the tax consequences of any big life changes that may have taken place, like getting married or divorced or having a baby, all of which could affect filing status and the number of personal exemptions, as well as bring medical expenses that may have tax consequences. Changing jobs or moving may also mean income changes that would affect withholding. If you have a financial account outside the United States, be careful to report it, Ms. Weltman said. “Foreign financial accounts are high on the I. R. S. scrutiny list, and people who fail to disclose foreign accounts can be penalized severely,” she said, including people who inherited accounts overseas and those who worked abroad and still have ties where they once lived. FinCEN Form 114, the Report of Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts, is used for accounts of $10, 000 or more and is filed electronically with the Treasury, while Form 8938, which is attached to Form 1040, is used in more complex situations, with the lowest threshold being for accounts of $50, 000.	1

183	DUBLIN  —   Enda Kenny, Ireland’s prime minister since 2011, is facing one of the worst political crises of his career over a convoluted police scandal that has dragged on for more than a decade. The scandal has been compared to the case of Frank Serpico, the detective whose testimony in the 1970s brought to light corruption in the New York Police Department. The matter dates to 2006, when an officer began raising concerns about   misconduct within the National Police Service. The officer, Sgt. Maurice McCabe, quickly found himself shunned by his fellow officers. But he persisted, exposing what he said was a practice of deleting penalty points incurred by drivers for minor traffic violations. Eventually, a government inquiry found in his favor. But the case won’t go away. Last week, The Irish Examiner and the public broadcaster RTE’s “Prime Time” program reported that Ireland’s child protection agency had created a file on Sergeant McCabe containing a false accusation of child sexual abuse  —   a mistake that the agency has attributed to what it called a clerical error. The news organizations also reported that this wasn’t the first time Sergeant McCabe had been wrongly accused of such a crime an earlier complaint against him had been made, in 2006, and dismissed. The disclosure that a   could face such accusations in apparent retaliation has raised unsettling questions about Ireland’s culture of policing and the possible collusion of other agencies, including the child protection agency. The case has affected the highest levels of the Irish government, bedeviling Mr. Kenny. He has been attacked by critics who charge that he missed opportunities to resolve the mess in 2014, and supported the police chief at the time and his justice minister for too long. Mr. Kenny failed at first to give a complete account of when he learned of the false abuse allegations, and has insisted that he knew nothing of a broader smear campaign  —   an assertion that his critics in Parliament have contested. There were heated exchanges between Mr. Kenny and Gerry Adams, the leader of the opposition Sinn Fein party. At one point, Mr. Kenny called Mr. Adams an “absolute hypocrite” and attacked him for playing down, years earlier, the case of a former Sinn Fein member who said she was sexually abused by IRA members  —   a charge that Mr. Adams denies. Mr. Kenny has pledged a new official inquiry into the latest developments in the McCabe case. Late Wednesday night he survived a   motion put forward by Sinn Fein. Both Mr. Kenny’s party, Fine Gael, and the Fianna Fail party, whose support Mr. Kenny needs, had little appetite for fresh elections that could unsettle their fragile alliance. But observers say the prime minister has been wounded by the scandal, and may not survive long after he returns from a trip to Washington to meet President Trump for St. Patrick’s Day. On Wednesday evening, ahead of the vote, Mr. Kenny apologized in Parliament to Sergeant McCabe. He called the allegations against him “appalling. ” “He and his family deserve the truth, as do all against whom allegations have been made,” Mr. Kenny said. “And I therefore offer a full apology to Maurice McCabe and his family for the treatment handed out to them as exposed in recent programs. ” Sergeant McCabe, and his wife, Lorraine, said in a statement that they had been victims of a “long and sustained campaign to destroy our characters. ” They added: “We have endured eight years of great suffering, private nightmare, public defamation, and state vilification arising solely,” they said, from Sergeant McCabe’s determination to ensure that the police agency “adheres to decent and appropriate standards of policing in its dealings with the Irish people. ” Sergeant McCabe, 55, a father of five from County Westmeath in the center of the country, has been on sick leave since last year. The McCabe case has exposed the secretive and insular nature of the police service. An internal investigation into Sergeant McCabe’s complaints found no evidence of corruption, but concluded that some officers had failed to follow procedures. But a police chief, Martin Callinan, stunned the country when he told lawmakers in 2014 that   like Sergeant McCabe were “disgusting. ” (He later took early retirement.) Dermot Walsh, a law professor at the University of Kent in England who has studied police and criminal justice in Ireland, said the uproar “was not so much what he was complaining about as the fact that he took his complaints outside the force  —   in other words, he was seen as not a team player, not a member of the club. ” Professor Walsh added that Sergeant McCabe “had stepped over to the other side of the line between ‘them’ and ‘us,’ ” and compared the case to that of Detective Serpico. He also said the hierarchical organization of the police agency made it resistant to criticism from its lower ranks. In 2014, the justice minister, Alan Shatter, resigned after a report commissioned by the government found that the government and the police had failed to address Sergeant McCabe’s allegations adequately. A second report, prepared by a commission led by a judge, Kevin O’Higgins, found that Sergeant McCabe had performed “a genuine public service at considerable personal cost. ” Now, the case is about to get yet another look. Mr. Kenny has promised to investigate whether a smear campaign targeted Sergeant McCabe. The task was originally assigned to a private commission of inquiry, led by a judge, but after the latest furor, Mr. Kenny agreed to appoint a tribunal, whose proceedings will be open to the public  —   something that Sergeant McCabe said he believed was essential. Another   Superintendent David Taylor, a former police press officer, has come forward to say that the existence of a smear campaign against Sergeant McCabe was widely known within the police force and by his superiors, including Commissioner Noirin O’Sullivan. She has asserted her innocence. “I have made it clear that I was not part of any campaign to spread rumors about Sergeant McCabe and didn’t know it was happening at the time it was happening,” Commissioner O’Sullivan said in a statement on Monday. Yet another police officer, Superintendent Keith Harrison, has come forward, saying that he stopped a colleague for drunken driving in 2009 and, in retaliation, found his family referred to the child protection agency over a baseless allegation.	1

396	The highly charged debate over transgender rights has resulted in a tangle of contradictory laws governing access to public bathrooms and locker rooms across the country. Many states permit transgender people to choose bathrooms and locker rooms based on their gender identity, considering it a civil rights issue. But in a handful of states and cities, legislators are moving in the opposite direction. Here are some milestones in the national debate. 2012 | Cities including Austin, Tex. Berkeley, Calif. Philadelphia Santa Fe, N. M. and Seattle were among the first to pass laws requiring     restrooms, following a pattern emerging at schools and universities. Soon museums, restaurants and even the White House (in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building) began rebranding restrooms, resulting in a dizzying range of creative signage and vocabulary. December 2014 | In a memo by Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. the Justice Department took the position that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 applied to claims of discrimination based on gender identity. The memo was one of a combination of policies, lawsuits and public statements that the Obama administration used to change the civil rights landscape for gay men, lesbians, bisexuals and transgender people. May 2016 | The Justice and Education Departments issued guidance that, under Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, schools receiving federal money may not discriminate based on a student’s transgender status  —   and that the departments would treat a student’s gender identity as the student’s sex for purposes of enforcing Title IX. Jan. 20, 2015 | President Barack Obama mentioned transgender people in his State of the Union address, a presidential first. “That’s why we defend free speech and advocate for political prisoners, and condemn the persecution of women, or religious minorities, or people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender,” Mr. Obama said. Nov. 3, 2015 | After a yearlong battle, Houston voters easily repealed an   ordinance that banned discrimination based on several “protected characteristics,” including gender identity. Opponents said the measure would allow men claiming to be women to enter women’s bathrooms and inflict harm. The message ”No Men in Women’s Bathrooms” on signs and in television and radio ads turned the debate from one about equal rights to one about protecting women and girls from sexual predators. (Houston became the largest city in the United States to elect an openly gay mayor, Annise D. Parker, in December 2009 she had pushed hard for the ordinance.) November, 2015 | Public schools began to write policies requiring transgender students to use private changing and showering facilities, drawing complaints of discrimination. February 2016 | The South Dakota Legislature approved a bill that would require public school students to use bathrooms and other facilities that correspond to their biological sex, defined in the bill as “a person’s chromosomes and anatomy as identified at birth. ” Gov. Dennis Daugaard, a Republican, vetoed it. The Legislature announced in January that it would consider a similar bill. March 23, 2016 | Meeting in special session, North Carolina legislators passed a   bill known as House Bill 2 barring transgender people from bathrooms and locker rooms that did not match their biological sex. Republicans unanimously supported the bill, while in the Senate, Democrats walked out in protest. “This is a direct affront to equality, civil rights and local autonomy,” the Senate Democratic leader, Dan Blue, said in a statement. The bill’s passage prompted the N. B. A. to withdraw this season’s   Game from Charlotte and led the N. C. A. A. to move playoff games in several sports  —   including   and   games in its most prominent event, the Division I men’s basketball tournament  —   out of the state. May 12, 2016 | The Obama administration took up a legal fight with North Carolina over the issue, quickly issuing guidance  —   signed by Justice and Education Department officials  —   that was sent to all school districts, outlining what schools should do to ensure that no student was discriminated against. The letter did not have the force of law, but it contained an implicit threat: Schools that did not abide by the Obama administration’s interpretation of the law could face lawsuits or a loss of federal dollars. The measure attracted criticism and support from across the country. Cities in the Deep South were increasingly at odds with their states on gay rights and other benchmarks, moving toward common ground with big cities on the coasts. And North Carolina, the rare Southern state that is evenly split between liberals and conservatives, was considered to be up for grabs in the November presidential race. But backlash against the law roiled the governor’s race and affected other crucial contests. April 19, 2016 | A federal appeals court in Richmond, Va. ruled in favor of Gavin Grimm, a transgender student who was born female and wanted to use the boys’ restroom at his rural Virginia high school. April 22, 2016 | As the Republican presidential   Donald J. Trump said that transgender people should be allowed to use whatever bathroom they feel most comfortable with. At a town   event, he said that North Carolina’s legislation had resulted in an exodus of businesses and “strife” from people on both sides of the issue. “You leave it the way it is,” he said. “There have been very few complaints the way it is. ” Aug. 21, 2016 | A federal judge in North Texas blocked the Obama administration from enforcing guidelines intended to expand restroom access for transgender students across the country. In his ruling, which he said should apply nationwide, Judge Reed O’Connor said the government had not complied with federal law when it issued “directives which contradict the existing legislative and regulatory text. ” The Trump administration has decided not to challenge the injunction in court. September 2016 | Gov. Jerry Brown, a Democrat, signed a bill requiring all   bathrooms to be gender neutral, effective March 1, the first such state legislation in the country. Jan. 5, 2017 | A bill revealed by Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, a Republican, would require transgender people to use bathrooms in government buildings and public schools and universities based on their “biological sex,” overruling any contrary local rules, and raising the prospect of a new confrontation with college sports officials and professional sports leagues. Feb. 22, 2017 | President Trump rescinded protections for transgender students that had allowed them to use bathrooms corresponding with their gender identity, overruling his own education secretary. In a joint letter, the top civil rights officials from the Justice and Education Departments rejected the Obama administration’s position that nondiscrimination laws require schools to allow transgender students to use the bathrooms of their choice. With Mr. Trump’s decision, the focus shifts to the Supreme Court, where Mr. Grimm’s 2016 lawsuit is scheduled for oral arguments at the end of March.	1
873	 “A Kentucky man who threw a boomerang that flew back and clobbered him in the head promptly filed a $300,000 lawsuit against himself — and incredibly, he was awarded the money!But most amazing of all is the fact that the guy will get the money from his insurance company — and he personally won’t have to pay a cent.“The accident occurred on my property so my homeowners insurance was liable for it,” Rutman said of the April 18 accident. “Some of my neighbors say this is crazy but it’s perfectly logical when you think about it. I paid that insurance for a long time just in case something unforseen like this ever happened. And now all those years of paying premiums have turned out to be worthwhile.”	0
798	  Paramount Pictures, one of the biggest players in Hollywood made a huge announcement this morning that will no doubt drive film fans into a frenzy — 21 years after its release,  the epic romantic-comedy-drama Forrest Gump is getting a remake — and what’s more, the flick is starring none other than celebrated comedic actor Jonah Hill himselfIn the press release, Paramount Pictures revealed that they had been planning a remake since 2009, but that they had not been able to find anyone who they thought could live up to Tom Hanks incredible performance in the original. This is what Robert Zemeckis, the director of the 1994 film as well as the upcoming remake, had to say:“You know when you got a film as successful and as influential as Forrest Gump, there’s this unspoken rule in Hollywood that you’ve got to make a remake and relaunch the story for a new generation. I am not ashamed of this, it’s what we do in Hollywood and it’s a great opportunity to create a new exciting version. This project has been on the drawing board for almost 6 years and I was just about to give up on it until 2012 when I saw 21 Jump Strett in the cinemas and saw Hill’s energy and comedic fire, I knew I wanted him to be Forrest. 3 years later, we are well into production and are expecting a 2016 release. Working with Hill is a blessing and he is really nailing his role!”   All stories on this site are satire and the opinions expressed do not belong to any real people.	0
652	 Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders made a surprise campaign stop in Nevada County on Monday afternoon. Sanders visited the area to announce his plan for a more environmentally friendly chemtrails program.“I needed to be here in Nevada County,” Sanders began his speech which was held in the parking lot behind the Sierra Super Stop, “where so many have voiced concerns about chemtrails.”“Our government continues to spray artificial chemicals on its own citizens to poison the population and geoengineer the climate,” Sanders said, “we know there are organic, sustainable alternatives that will accomplish the same objectives without damaging the Earth.”“For example, deadly Cobra venom,” Sanders continued, “which the government can purchase directly from snake charmer collectives in India using fair trade guidelines.”“The soil ruining nano-aluminum coated fiberglass particles have got to go,” Sanders said. “We need a more biodegradable chemtrail future.” This website is satirical in scope and intent.

755	 Barack Hussein is planning to send 250,000 Muslim refugees to the Navajo reservations of AZ and ND. Moronic!! The U.S. Department of State announced today that it will grant upwards of two-hundred and fifty thousand Syrian refugees temporary amnesty in the United States. Over the next four months, State Department officials working in conjunction with FEMA will begin processing and transporting the refugees to sparsely populated parts of Arizona and North Dakota.“Due to the increasingly dire humanitarian situation in the Middle East, the United States has agreed to facilitate the transfer of a number of Syrian refugees to the Navajo and Standing Rock reservations where they will be provided with food, shelter, and medical treatment,” Cathy Pieper, a spokesperson for the Department of State, said Friday. Ahmed Alsouki, who, along with his wife and two children, was one of the first Syrians to be granted temporary amnesty by the United States, told Vice News he feels very fortunate about the situation. “Before the war I was an entrepreneur,” Alsouki said. “I traveled many times to New Delhi on business, so I am very familiar with the Indian way of life.”	0
744	 The California Legislature has passed a controversial Assembly Bill that creates a ban on the future sale and ownership of all .45 ACP ammo. The bill states that the ban on the popular ammunition is in effect immediately, however does include a 60 day grace period prior to state law enforcement enforcing the ban.Though the ban has created a clear divide among the citizens of California, it’s said to be widely supported by political figures across the state. Many politicians and citizens alike feel that that ban is a clear infringement of California citizen’s second amendment rights, however; many feel that the ban is a positive step towards much needed gun control.

231	I was 15 years old. Not yet a proud immigrant to this country. A young Muslim growing up in Nairobi with the very good fortune of having a dad who was an airline pilot. It was 1993 when he took me on a trip to London for the first time. But it wasn’t Big Ben or Buckingham Palace that caught my eye. It was a giant theater billboard with a name I knew: Craig McLachlan, a star of the Australian soap opera “Neighbours” (British spelling, thank you very much). The soap was hugely popular in Kenya, so I recognized him immediately. Also on the poster was a woman’s name I didn’t know at the time: Debbie Gibson (or was she going by Deborah in those days?) The poster was hot pink silhouetted against the background was the face of a cool dude with sunglasses and a giant wave of jet black hair. It was advertising some show called “Grease. ” I was intrigued. I persuaded my dad to give me enough pounds for a ticket. It was sold out, so all I could get was standing room, which was fine by me. In Kenya, the only live performances I had seen were acting skits in my high school assembly hall and comedy shows on the   television network. I didn’t know what to expect. I was there so I could tell my friends that I saw Craig McLachlan in the flesh. Then the lights went down, and I was blown away. Experiencing the show was like sitting in a wind tunnel. I felt assaulted by the power coming from the biggest stage I had ever seen. It was spectacular and epic and sexy and HUGE. All the emotions were supersized, the dancing was electric, the singing was stupendous, the actors were unbelievable. I was in heaven. I didn’t want it to end. Afterwards, I finagled more money from my dad and bought the cast album cassette at the theater. I had to take a tangible piece of the show with me. In bed that night, I kept seeing the colors and images and magical moving set pieces in my head. The trip came to an end, but back home in Nairobi, I couldn’t stop thinking about “Grease. ” My immediate instinct was that I had to reproduce it. Somehow, some way, I needed to make that experience happen again, and I wanted to be inside it and outside it all at once. So I sat at my Commodore 64 computer and typed out all the dialogue I could remember. I listened to the cassette on my Walkman, jogging my memory to fill in the gaps of what happened between the songs. No one told me about John Travolta and Olivia    —   that there was a movie version of the show I could have easily watched on VHS. Would have saved me a lot of hours. Ah well. After my “script” was complete, I talked my high school friends into being in the show and assigned their roles. No auditions necessary it’s set in a high school, after all. I would play Danny Zuko (only in Africa in the ’90s could a boy like me play the leader of the   without irony). Naturally my best friend would be Kenickie. There was a problem, though: I went to Jamhuri High, an   school. What about the girls’ roles?   was definitely not in my consciousness at 15, so to round out the cast, I picked an   school near my home, State House Girls, and set out to convince one of their teachers to allow us to partner up and put on the show. She asked me what the point of doing this was. On the spot, I said, “Well, we’re going to raise money for the K. S. P. C. A. It’s for charity. ” Good cause, check. She was sold. Next problem: money. We needed costumes, furniture, cool things to put onstage. I knew we would never recreate the incredible set pieces from London, like the end of Act I bleacher that glided magically across the stage during “We Go Together. ” (OMG, how did they do that? !) I tasked my classmates to go around town, knock on business doors and ask them to donate to our production and support the young artists of tomorrow. We raised 10, 000 Ksh (about $96 today). More than enough. So now we had a script. We had actors. We had the cassette we were going to lip sync to. (Did I mention none of us could sing?) We had the school’s permission (but not the publisher’s  —   sorry Samuel French, I know better now). And since this was my bright idea, I assumed the task of putting the show together as well. I directed, choreographed, designed and starred in that very makeshift, highly illegal,   Nairobi premiere of “Grease. ” The show went off without a hitch. No one cared that we couldn’t have been further from the   privileges enjoyed at Rydell High, or that our kinky hair stubbornly refused to slick back no matter how much grease we applied. We were   kids expressing desire, heartbreak and the promise of a bright, heteronormative future where every boy gets the girl. That I had assembled every aspect of the production was intoxicating. It was no longer enough to perform. I had found my fix. I’ve moved on to telling stories more complex than “Grease. ” I’m especially attracted to plays and musicals that ask challenging questions about identity, and lately, the responsibility of citizenship. But the theater that appeals to me doesn’t shy away from spectacle, or from embracing the power of music to tell a story. A little Greased Lightning never hurts.	1
263	I once received a lot of blowback for an Upshot article in which I showed (with evidence) that exercise is not the key to weight loss. Diet is. Many, many readers cannot wrap their head around the notion that adding physical activity, and therefore burning more calories, doesn’t necessarily translate into results on the scale. Well, here we go again because some of those folks also believe that fitness devices  —   Fitbit, Vivosmart, Apple Watch  —   must be helpful in losing weight. Unfortunately, evidence doesn’t support this belief either. For some time, people have been trying to prove devices like these succeed in promoting weight loss. In 2011, a study compared four groups getting a mixture of behavioral weight loss programs and use of an armband that measured activity and energy expenditure. All the intervention groups lost weight, but those with behavioral programs and technology lost the most. The sample size of each group (fewer than 50) and the large dropout rate of the study should temper enthusiasm, though. The sample was also mostly female, and more than   of them had college degrees, so the results may not be entirely generalizable. In 2015, another study, the   trial, was also inconclusive. Researchers randomly assigned 250 people ages 60 to 75 to one of two groups. The first group received four physical activity consultations from primary care nurses over three months a pedometer and a physical activity diary. The other received “usual care. ” All patients were given accelerometers to measure their activity, although only the control group saw the results. One year later, those in the pedometer group were taking an average of about 600 more steps per day, and had about 40 more minutes of activity a week. But it’s hard in a trial like this to know how much of that was because of the pedometer and the feedback, and how much was because of the nurse visits and coaching. What was needed was a large,   study that truly teased out the contribution of wearable tech to weight loss programs. Last year, the results of such a study, the IDEA trial, were published. The trial took place at the University of Pittsburgh between 2010 and 2012, and it involved more than 470 adults between the ages of 18 and 35. All of them were put on a   diet, had group counseling sessions and were advised to increase their physical activity. Six months into the intervention, all were given telephone counseling sessions,   prompts and study materials online. At that time, though, half were also given wearable tech devices that monitored their activity and connected to a website to help provide feedback. All participants were followed for 18 more months. At the end of the two years, which is pretty long for a weight loss study, those without access to the wearable technology lost an average of 13 pounds. Those with the wearable tech lost an average of 7. 7 pounds. It’s hard for many to accept, so I’m going to state the results again: Those people who used the wearable tech for 18 months lost significantly less weight than those who didn’t. You may rightfully point out that the primary reason to wear the devices isn’t to lose weight  —   it’s to be more active. But even in this respect, it didn’t work nearly as well as we might hope. In the IDEA trial, those who employed the technology were no more physically active than those who didn’t. They also weren’t more fit. Many new technologies, and dietary supplements and new diets, are sold to the public with little actual research behind them. Wearable technology to encourage fitness is no different. Somehow, in the past few years, it has become collectively understood that we need to take 10, 000 steps a day. But there’s no magic behind that number. There’s no reason to believe that hitting this arbitrary goal is somehow  . Exercise is worthwhile for its own sake. Of course, many people can enjoy using wearable tech without tying it to weight loss goals. I have owned a Fitbit, a Nike FuelBand and an Apple Watch. I still wear the watch because I like many of its features. When I first bought it, I liked how it tracked my daily 30 minutes of physical activity and reminded me to stand up every so often. But I realized over time that I didn’t really need it. After some months, getting 30 minutes of activity a day (the recommended amount) became part of my routine. I learned to be more mobile and less sedentary. I didn’t need the precision or the reminders anymore. It’s possible that the devices helped me make physical activity part of my regular routine. It’s possible that they provided a benefit. But my experience is just an anecdote, and there’s no counterfactual to help figure out whether I’d have become more active without the devices. For that, we’d need a trial. The ones that exist (like the IDEA trial) argue that the devices don’t make people exercise more. They don’t seem to hurt, though. Other than costing money, there’s no harm in seeing if it might improve your activity over time. But if your goal is weight loss, then you might think twice about using such a device. The evidence suggests that you may do better without one.	1
112	WASHINGTON  —   Robert S. Harward, the retired vice admiral who is President Trump’s top choice to replace his ousted national security adviser, is a   member of the Navy SEALs who rose through the ranks to top military positions and is close with Jim Mattis, the new secretary of defense. Mr. Harward, 60, is a former deputy commander of the United States Central Command, the military’s busiest with management of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and served on the National Security Council under President George W. Bush, where he was responsible for counterterrorism issues. He is currently a top executive at Lockheed Martin, the weapons and aerospace company, overseeing business with the United Arab Emirates. Mr. Harward’s career has closely tracked that of Mr. Mattis, from the time the two worked together in Afghanistan after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks of 2001 to his tour at Central Command from 2011 to 2013, which included an assignment heading detainee operations in Kabul. “He has faced down and defeated the world’s most ruthless and deadly enemies, and he has done all that by Mattis’s side,” said Fran Townsend, Mr. Bush’s former homeland security adviser, for whom Mr. Harward worked from 2003 to 2005. “He has been in tougher knife fights than this, and won. ” Still, it is not clear whether Mr. Harward would be willing to surrender his lucrative position and comfortable existence in Abu Dhabi to step into the tumult of the Trump White House. The new administration has been troubled by an unusual level of infighting, disorganization and grievance  —   including within the ranks of the National Security Council  —   capped off on Monday by the resignation of Michael T. Flynn as national security adviser. Raised in prerevolutionary Tehran, Mr. Harward was known to startle his Afghan counterparts during his tours there by conversing with them fluently in Farsi, which is similar to their native Dari. Trained as an elite Special Operations officer, Mr. Harward is also known for his bravado and obsession with physical fitness. As the head of detainee operations in Afghanistan, he would lead weekly hikes in the mountains outside Kabul, outpacing colleagues who were 20 years younger, and has been known to challenge them to   contests that left them vomiting. Mr. Harward looks the part of a   military man, a crucial factor for a president who has made clear that he considers appearance an important indicator of a job candidate’s suitability for a role. With his bald head,   eyes and long scar of mysterious provenance down his cheek, Mr. Harward has the bearing of an officer who once carried out risky secret operations. But he is also an effective inside player, according to people who know him, having worked for some of the military’s top policy leaders and at the White House. James G. Stavridis, a retired admiral and former NATO commander, said Mr. Harward was “someone who will find a way to succeed no matter how daunting the task. ” “I have known him well for two decades, and have boundless admiration for his ingenuity, integrity and ability to navigate choppy seas  —   both operationally in the field and in the battlefield of Washington, D. C.,” said Mr. Stavridis, currently dean of the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University. “The real question,” he added, “is whether he wants to take the job. ” Some question whether Mr. Harward’s decades of military experience are the right preparation for a senior   post. In a Twitter post Tuesday, Max Boot, a senior fellow in national security studies at the Council on Foreign Relations, called Mr. Harward “a great SEAL,” but said it was “not clear that running detainee ops in Afghanistan or being No 2 at Centcom is right background for this. ” Friends say Mr. Harward has experience with   military special operations, but also in navigating the arcane world of the National Security Council, which is charged with synthesizing recommendations from national security and intelligence agencies and advising the president on policy. The process frequently involves managing turf battles and balancing competing interests. “He’ll bring a buffering calm and balance, as well as his using his previous experience at the N. S. C. ,” said Douglas H. Wise, a former deputy director at the Defense Intelligence Agency. Mr. Mattis is widely seen as a force for steadiness within the Trump administration, and some Republicans who have expressed misgivings about the president’s policies and his attitude toward national security matters have looked to his defense secretary as an island of reliability in a sea of unpredictability. Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona and chairman of the Armed Services Committee, said on Tuesday that Mr. Trump should name a new national security adviser “who is empowered by clear lines of authority and responsibility and possesses the skills and experience necessary to organize the national security system across our government. ” Mr. McCain said he looked forward “to working with the president’s administration, especially Secretary Mattis, to defend the nation and support our military service members. ” If he is chosen for the post and accepts, Mr. Harward would be reunited with his old boss and mentor, Mr. Mattis. But he would also have to contend with Mr. Trump’s inner circle, populated by political advisers with whom Mr. Harward is not familiar, including Steven K. Bannon, the chief White House strategist. In an executive order last month  —   which Mr. Trump later complained privately that he had not been fully briefed on  —   the president placed Mr. Bannon on the principals committee of the National Security Council, giving a political adviser a position of parity with the secretaries of state and defense, and with the national security adviser. Two former national security officials who have worked closely with Mr. Harward said he would be unlikely to take the position without strong assurances from Mr. Trump and his team that the council would not be driven by partisan considerations on national security policy, and that he would have the autonomy to provide principled counsel. They spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak on Mr. Harward’s behalf. Mr. Harward’s name surfaced briefly in 2015 in connection to the scandal involving David H. Petraeus, the former general who was forced to resign as director of the Central Intelligence Agency after admitting that he had provided classified information to his lover, and who is now also said to be in the running to be Mr. Trump’s national security adviser. Jill Kelley, a Tampa socialite who had befriended Mr. Petraeus and then become a target of threatening emails from Mr. Petraeus’ lover, had also written gushing notes to Mr. Harward and Mr. Mattis. “You ROCK! !!” Ms. Kelley wrote to Mr. Harward in 2012 regarding his dealings with foreign heads of state at a social gathering, according to emails obtained by The Washington Post. “YOU ROCK MORE! ,” Mr. Harward replied. There was no evidence of impropriety in the friendly correspondence, which would have been routine between top military commanders and civic leaders in the communities in which they were stationed.	1

3	WASHINGTON  —   President Trump and his advisers, venturing for the first time into the fraught world of Middle East peacemaking, are developing a strategy on the   conflict that would enlist Arab nations like Saudi Arabia and Egypt to break years of deadlock. The emerging approach mirrors the thinking of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, who will visit the United States next week, and would build on his de facto alignment with Sunni Muslim countries in trying to counter the rise of   Iran. But Arab officials have warned Mr. Trump and his advisers that if they want cooperation, the United States cannot make life harder for them with provocative   moves. The White House seems to be taking the advice. Mr. Trump delayed his plan to move the United States Embassy to Jerusalem after Arab leaders told him that doing so would cause angry protests among Palestinians, who also claim the city as the capital of a future state. And after meeting with King Abdullah II of Jordan last week, Mr. Trump authorized a statement that, for the first time, cautioned Israel against building new West Bank settlements beyond existing lines. “There are some quite interesting ideas circulating on the potential for U. S.   discussions on regional security in which   issues would play a significant role,” said Robert Satloff, the executive director of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. “I don’t know if this is going to ripen by next week, but this stuff is out there. ” The discussions underscore the evolution of the new president’s attitude toward the   conflict as he delves deeper into the issue. During the campaign and the postelection transition, Mr. Trump presented himself as an unstinting supporter of Israel who would quickly move the embassy and support new settlement construction without reservation. But he has tempered that to a degree. The notion of recruiting Arab countries to help forge an agreement between Israelis and Palestinians  —   known as the “ ” approach  —   is not a new one. As secretary of state under President George Bush, James A. Baker III organized the first regional conference in 1991 at which Arab leaders sat down with Israel’s prime minister. President George W. Bush invited Arab leaders to a summit meeting with Israel in Annapolis, Md. in 2007. And President Barack Obama’s first special envoy, George Mitchell, spent months in 2009 trying to enlist Arab partners in a joint effort. The difference is that in the last eight years, Israel has grown closer to Sunni Arab nations because of their shared concern about Iranian hegemony in the region, opening the possibility that this newfound, if not always public, affiliation could change the dynamics. “The logic of   is that because the Palestinians are so weak and divided  —   and because there’s a new, tacit relationship between the Sunni Arabs and Israel  —   there’s the hope the Arabs would be prepared to do more,” said Dennis B. Ross, a Middle East peace negotiator under several presidents, including Mr. Obama. That is a departure from the countervailing assumption that if Israel first made peace with the Palestinians, it would lead to peace with the larger Arab world  —   the “ ” approach. That was at the core of President Bill Clinton’s attempts to bring the two sides together and was Mr. Obama’s fallback position after his efforts to find Arab partners failed. Mr. Netanyahu, who is due at the White House on Wednesday, has been talking about an   approach for a while. His theory is that the   approach has failed. And so, he argues, if Israel can transform its relationship with Sunni Arab nations, they can ultimately lead the way toward a resolution with the Palestinians. Jared Kushner, the senior White House adviser whom Mr. Trump has assigned a major role in negotiations, has been intrigued by this logic, according to people who have spoken with him. Mr. Kushner has grown close to Ron Dermer, the Israeli ambassador and a close confidant of Mr. Netanyahu’s. Mr. Trump and Mr. Kushner also had dinner at the White House on Thursday night with Sheldon Adelson, the casino magnate, who is a key supporter of Mr. Netanyahu. A series of telephone conversations and personal meetings with Arab and regional leaders in recent weeks have also shaped Mr. Kushner’s thinking and that of the president. Mr. Trump has talked with President Abdel Fattah   of Egypt King Salman of Saudi Arabia Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed   the crown prince of Abu Dhabi, in the United Arab Emirates and President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey. Mr. Kushner has also met with Arab officials, including Yousef Al Otaiba, the ambassador from the United Arab Emirates. King Abdullah II of Jordan seems to have played a particularly pivotal role. Concerned that an embassy move would anger the many Palestinians living in his country, the king rushed to Washington without an invitation, in a gamble that he could see Mr. Trump. He visited first with Vice President Mike Pence, who had him over for breakfast at his official residence last week. The king appealed to the administration’s fixation with the Islamic State, arguing that the United States should not alienate Arab allies who could help. Several days later, the king buttonholed Mr. Trump on the sidelines of the National Prayer Breakfast and made a similar case. He advised against a radical shift in American policy and emphasized the risks that Jordan would face if Israel were to become even more assertive about building settlements, according to people who spoke with Mr. Kushner and Stephen K. Bannon, the chief White House strategist. Mr. Trump had already decided by that point to slow down the embassy move  —   a decision that did not especially trouble Mr. Netanyahu and his team, who, while publicly supporting a move, privately urged caution to avoid a violent backlash. The administration had also received reports from American diplomats in Jordan that the threat level for a terrorist attack there had been raised to the highest level in years. But a series of announcements of new settlement construction worried some White House officials, who thought Mr. Netanyahu was taking action without first meeting with Mr. Trump. Within hours of Mr. Trump’s meeting with King Abdullah, the administration leaked a statement to The Jerusalem Post saying, “We urge all parties from taking unilateral actions that could undermine our ability to make progress, including settlement announcements. ” After that was posted online, the White House issued a public statement with softened language: “While we don’t believe the existence of settlements is an impediment to peace, the construction of new settlements or the expansion of existing settlements beyond their current borders may not be helpful in achieving that goal. ” It was worded in a way that let different parties focus on different parts. The “may not be helpful” phrase was the first time Mr. Trump had warned against new housing in the West Bank. But the “beyond their current borders” phrase suggested a return to George W. Bush’s policy of essentially acquiescing to additional construction within existing settlement blocs as long as Israel did not expand their geographical reach or build entirely new settlements. Elliott Abrams, one of the authors of that policy under Mr. Bush, is poised to become deputy secretary of state under Mr. Trump. Mr. Netanyahu’s team focused on that part of the statement. “I happen to know they were very pleased with the statement because it was such a contrast from Obama,” said Morton A. Klein, the national president of the Zionist Organization of America, who has been supportive of the Trump administration. Indeed, undeterred, Mr. Netanyahu’s coalition pushed through Parliament a bill to retroactively authorize thousands of homes in the West Bank that even under Israeli law had been built illegally on   land. Mr. Klein, who argues that settlements are not an obstacle to peace, said the White House had made the statement too confusing to provide clear direction. “I did find it ambiguous, and not as clear as I would like it to be,” he said. The challenge now is whether Mr. Trump can use this ambiguity to his benefit. If the United States can extract gestures from the Arabs, then that could provide a basis for Israelis and Palestinians to make compromises that they could not do by themselves, Mr. Ross said. “You’d have to have some kind of parallel approach,” he said. “This would be a serious investment of diplomacy to probe what is possible. ”	1
425	WASHINGTON  —   Like many presidents before him, President Trump is pushing a bold budget proposal. But for a business executive used to getting his way, he is likely to find, as his predecessors did, that final budgets often bear little resemblance to the originals after being run through the shredder on Capitol Hill. Here is a look at some of the main issues hanging over the coming budget and spending fight. Taking the ax to the Environmental Protection Agency or to State Department aid programs may excite Mr. Trump’s supporters, but he is unlikely to succeed to the extent he would like. His budget is simply a starting point and any cuts would have to be made through the congressional appropriations process. Though in the minority, Democrats retain significant leverage in crafting that legislation and can block bills they oppose in the Senate. “Enacting appropriations law  —   as opposed to proposing nonbinding budget resolutions  —   will likely require Democratic votes,” Representative Nita Lowey of New York, the senior Democrat on the Appropriations Committee, noted tartly on Monday. It is doubtful cuts of the kind being proposed will fly. Presidential budgets are important as statements of policy and budgetary goals. They stand mainly as political manifestoes of what the White House hopes to achieve  —   and would do if it had its own way. The Trump administration’s budget also serves as a message to those who supported the new president that he intends to follow through on his campaign promises to cut government spending, even while bolstering the military. Mr. Trump can point to his budget as an illustration of what he had wanted to do before Congress got in his way. And while the unveiling of a budget draws a lot of media attention, the failure to meet many of its goals months or years later seldom produces anywhere near as much news coverage. Military spending remains popular and touches every state and most House districts, giving lawmakers ample incentive to support it. President Barack Obama had proposed his own spending increases. But Democrats have insisted that any increase in Pentagon spending must be matched by higher spending on domestic programs that they favor. The Trump budget, instead, seeks to raise military spending and offset the increases with cuts to domestic programs  —   an approach most Democrats and some Republicans will resist. At the same time, some conservative House Republicans have previously balked at Pentagon increases, arguing that they are wasteful. Then there is Senator John McCain, the Arizona Republican who chairs the Armed Services Committee and argues the White House is not seeking enough new money for the military. Some higher Pentagon spending is possible, but it is unclear it will be enough to satisfy Mr. Trump or Republican hawks. And it won’t come easily. Republicans certainly hope so. They will try to keep as much pressure on Democrats as possible. One strategic approach Republicans are likely to embrace is to move first on a Pentagon spending bill with added spending and then dare Senate Democrats to oppose it, attacking them for shortchanging the military. If Democrats relent and approve the bill, they will sacrifice some of their political influence over the rest of the budget. Top Democrats say their success or failure will depend on a willingness to remain united in their budget position. The party did so last year and successfully derailed the appropriations process. But they are worried about their ability to do so again this year with 10 Senate Democrats up for   in 2018 in states won by Mr. Trump. Yes. In recent years, Congress has failed miserably when it comes to passing annual spending bills  —   the most basic responsibility of lawmakers  —   and has instead relied on a series of stopgap measures. Last year, the House and Senate sent Mr. Obama just one of the 12 required annual appropriations measures. The government is now running under a temporary funding bill called a continuing resolution, which expires on April 28. Given the level of budget discord, it is conceivable the government will run the entire fiscal year ending Sept. 30 at last year’s spending level. That possibility illustrates the fundamental problem for Mr. Trump. Budget priorities are enacted through the appropriations bills. Passing appropriations bills requires some level of bipartisan cooperation. As budget details emerge, it appears Mr. Trump’s spending plan will not elicit much Democratic support, severely limiting his chances of success. This fight is more between Mr. Trump and Republicans on Capitol Hill. Mr. Trump promised repeatedly during his campaign to leave those huge programs untouched, reassuring his voters who rely on them. Congressional Republicans, notably Speaker Paul D. Ryan, have in the past proposed significant structural changes to the programs  —   particularly Medicare  —   to win real budget savings. If such entitlement programs are left out of the equation, more dollars have to be squeezed from agency budgets, setting up the fight over federal priorities likely to consume Congress later this year.	1

Thousands of Christian couples, some who have been married for decades, have vowed to file for divorce in the wake of the Supreme Court ruling which has legalized gay marriage nationwide.As hundreds of homosexual couples applied for marriage licenses on Monday morning, dozens of Christian couples simultaneously filed for divorce. Susan Hines, an employee at Calvin and Hayes Family Court in San Diego California commented on her observations since the ruling. “We have seen a noticeable uptick in couples calling in requesting information on the divorce process. Many of these couples have been married for decades and they seem to want to figuratively dissolve their union since the ruling because they disapprove of gay marriage. They don’t seem to care about the consequences and we’re legally obliged to fulfill their requests.”	0
733	 Concerned for his nation, but more for his party, Lindsey Graham spoke to Free Wood Post candidly after he announced he was dropping out of the race:“Listen, the Republican party is f*cked.

For f*ck’s sake, they could have at least allowed me onto the main debate stage to actually have a solid voice of reason against the overwhelming buffoonery.

You have honored me with your support.I believe we’ve run a campaign you can be proud of. We put forward bold and practical solutions to big problems, like retiring our debt and fixing a broken immigration system. This has been a problem solver’s campaign.However, the centerpiece of my campaign has been securing our nation. I got into this race to put forward a plan to win a war we cannot afford to lose and to turn back the tide of isolationism that was rising in our party. I believe we’ve made enormous progress in this effort.Four months ago at the very first debate, I said that any candidate that did not understand that we need more American troops on the ground in Iraq and Syria to defeat ISIL was not ready to be commander-in-chief. At that time, no one stepped forward to join me. Today, most of my fellow candidates have come to recognize this is what’s needed to secure our homeland.I am far more confident today that our party will reject the Obama doctrine of leading from behind and will provide the strong leadership America needs to restore our military, take the fight to our enemies and do what it takes to make our country safe and preserve our way of life.This is a generational struggle that demands a strategy and the will to win. I will continue to work every day to ensure that our party — and our nation — takes on this fight. I’m suspending my campaign, but never my commitment to achieving security through strength for the American people.God bless our fighting men and women, and God bless America.

160	WASHINGTON  —   President Trump on Thursday dismissed reports about his associates’ contacts with Russia last year and vigorously defended his performance in his first four weeks in office, in a contentious news conference that showcased his unconventional and unconstrained presidency. At a hastily organized White House event  —   ostensibly to announce a new nominee for labor secretary, R. Alexander Acosta  —   Mr. Trump engaged in an extended attack on the news media and insisted that his new administration was not a chaotic operation but a “  machine. ” Any challenges, he said, were not his fault. “To be honest, I inherited a mess,” he said. In addition to his cabinet announcement, the president revealed that he had asked the Justice Department to investigate government leaks and said he would sign an executive order next week restricting travel to the United States. He promised to produce by March a plan to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, followed by another plan to overhaul the tax system. But his   news conference was dominated by an extraordinarily raw and angry defense of both his administration and his character. At times abrupt, often rambling, characteristically boastful yet seemingly pained at the portrayals of him, Mr. Trump kept summoning the spirit of his successful campaign after a month of grinding governance to remind his audience, again, that he won. For a president who has already lost a court battle, fired an acting attorney general and a national security adviser, and lost a cabinet nomination fight, Mr. Trump was eager to demonstrate that he was still in command. He attacked judges for blocking his original travel order and Democrats for obstructing his nominations. He denied being   even when no one accused him of it. With the latest Pew Research Center poll showing that just 39 percent of Americans approve of the job he is doing, Mr. Trump at one point plaintively pleaded for understanding. “The tone is such hatred,” he said, referring to the commentary about him on cable television. “I’m really not a bad person. ” Mr. Trump disputed any contention that the White House was out of control or not fully functional, and boasted of a flurry of actions intended to create jobs, curb regulations and crack down on illegal immigration. “There has never been a presidency that has done so much in such a short period of time,” he said. “And we haven’t even started the big work yet. That starts early next week. ” The enactment of a temporary ban on refugees and all visitors from seven predominantly Muslim countries, he maintained, was “perfect,” despite widespread confusion and subsequent court rulings blocking it. “We had a very smooth rollout of the travel ban,” he said. “But we had a bad court. ” Mr. Trump offered his first account of his decision to fire Michael T. Flynn, his national security adviser, for misleading Vice President Mike Pence and others in the White House about the contents of a conversation with Russia’s ambassador in December. He said he was not bothered that Mr. Flynn had talked with the ambassador about American sanctions on Russia before arriving at the White House. “I didn’t direct him,” he said, “but I would have directed him, because that’s his job. ” The problem, he said, was that Mr. Flynn had told Mr. Pence that sanctions did not come up during the conversation, an assertion belied by a transcript of the call, which had been monitored by American intelligence agencies. “The thing is he didn’t tell our vice president properly, and then he said he didn’t remember,” Mr. Trump said. “So either way, it wasn’t very satisfactory to me. ” But he said reports that his campaign aides and other associates had contacts with Russia were “a joke” and “fake news put out by the media. ” The New York Times reported this week that phone records and intercepted calls showed repeated contacts between some of his associates and Russian intelligence officials in the year before the election. “Russia is a ruse,” Mr. Trump said. “I have nothing to do with Russia. To the best of my knowledge, no person that I deal with does. ” However, Mr. Trump said, all the pressure on Russia may ruin any future negotiations with President Vladimir V. Putin. “Putin probably assumes that he can’t make a deal with me anymore because politically, it would be unpopular for a politician to make a deal,” he said. Like presidents before him, Mr. Trump was peeved at a series of leaks, including about Mr. Flynn’s call and his own conversations with foreign leaders. In addition to requesting the Justice Department investigation, he confirmed that he might assign a New York billionaire, Stephen A. Feinberg, to conduct a broad review of the intelligence agencies. “He’s offered his services, and you know, it’s something we may take advantage of,” Mr. Trump said. But he added that it might not be necessary because “we are going to be able to straighten it out very easily on its own. ” Mr. Trump returned again and again to his contest with Hillary Clinton, replaying key events from the 2016 campaign and reviving his favorite attacks. He repeated a claim that Mrs. Clinton gave Russia access to American nuclear fuel supplies. “I’ve done nothing for Russia,” he said. “Hillary Clinton gave them 20 percent of our uranium. ” The State Department did sign off on the purchase of a Canadian company by a Russian state firm that gave Russia control of   of America’s uranium production capacity, as did eight other agencies. But Mrs. Clinton was not in a position to approve or reject the deal when she was secretary of state, and it is not known if she was briefed on the matter. Mr. Trump spent much of the conference berating reporters and their news organizations. Clearly exasperated by coverage of him, he said he did not watch CNN but then gave a detailed critique of one of its shows. He cited specific articles in The Times and The Wall Street Journal that he called “fake,” even harking back to one from last year’s campaign. “The press is out of control,” he said. “The level of dishonesty is out of control. ” He added later, “The public doesn’t believe you people anymore. ” The acrimony grew so sharp at one point that CNN’s Jim Acosta felt the need to tell Mr. Trump, “Just for the record, we don’t hate you. ” But that did not assuage him. At one point, he called on Jake Turx, an   Jewish reporter from Ami Magazine. “Are you a friendly reporter?” he asked. “I haven’t seen anybody in my community accuse either yourself or anyone on your staff of being ” Mr. Turx said. But, citing bomb threats against Jewish centers, he said, “What we haven’t really heard being addressed is an uptick in   and how the government is planning to take care of it. ” Mr. Trump bristled, taking it as a suggestion that he was   even though the reporter specifically said the opposite. “I am the least   person that you’ve ever seen in your entire life,” Mr. Trump said. Mr. Turx protested that he was not suggesting otherwise. “Quiet, quiet, quiet,” Mr. Trump said. “See? He lied. He was going to get up and ask a very straight, simple question. ” Instead, Mr. Trump said, the question was “repulsive” and “very insulting. ” He later accused Democrats of posing as supporters and holding up offensive signs at his rallies to smear him. When April Ryan of American Urban Radio Networks asked whether he would meet with the Congressional Black Caucus to discuss his urban agenda, Mr. Trump again seemed piqued. “Do you want to set up the meeting?” he challenged her. “Are they friends of yours?” “I’m just a reporter,” said Ms. Ryan, who is  . “Well, then, set up the meeting,” Mr. Trump said. That exchange and others included claims that were false or disputed. Mr. Trump told Ms. Ryan that he had planned a meeting with Representative Elijah E. Cummings, an   Democrat from Maryland, but that Mr. Cummings had said: “It might be bad for me politically. I can’t have that meeting. ” Mr. Cummings later denied that. “I have no idea why President Trump would make up a story about me like he did today,” he said. “I was actually looking forward to meeting with the president about the skyrocketing price of prescription drugs. ” Similarly, Mr. Trump asserted that his Electoral College victory was the largest since Ronald Reagan’s. But he won fewer Electoral College votes than three of the four presidents since Reagan: Barack Obama, Bill Clinton and George Bush. When a reporter pointed that out, Mr. Trump brushed it off. “I was given that information,” he said.	1

66	BALTIMORE  —   The outpouring of protests across the country has scrambled the contest for chairman of the Democratic National Committee two weeks before the vote, as party activists thrash out who should be the face of a newly energized party. The surge of liberal activism in response to President Trump’s election has transcended the divisions that some Democrats feared would cleave the party after its defeat in November. But it has also injected volatility into a race for party chairman that had been shaping up as a straightforward proxy war between the candidates most closely identified with Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Hillary Clinton. Representative Keith Ellison of Minnesota, one of Mr. Sanders’s most prominent surrogates during last year’s primary race, and Thomas E. Perez, the former labor secretary who backed Mrs. Clinton and received consideration to be her running mate, have emerged as the leading contenders. Yet neither has secured the support of anywhere close to a majority of the 447 committee members who will decide the race, as other candidates did in the weeks leading up to prior votes. This is partly because other hopefuls in a field that has swelled to double digits have yet to withdraw from the race. But it also owes to the genuine uncertainty about who can best harness the antipathy toward Mr. Trump, and lead a party that has been dominated by former President Barack Obama, former President Bill Clinton and Mrs. Clinton for more than two decades. At the final   candidate forum here on Saturday, the leading candidates all sought to associate themselves with the “resistance” against Mr. Trump. In an acknowledgment of how much Democrats are enjoying their   unity  —   and how much they do not want a replay of the   race  —   Mr. Perez and Mr. Ellison held to a de facto nonaggression pact toward each another. “I had no better friend,” Mr. Ellison said of Mr. Perez, referring to the former secretary’s time in the Obama cabinet. Strikingly, only one candidate among the 10 onstage truly confronted the two  : Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind. “Why not go with somebody who isn’t a product of one faction or another faction, but somebody who is here to deliver the fresh start our party needs,” said Mr. Buttigieg, adding of the party’s contentious presidential primary, “I don’t know why we’d want to live through it a second time. ” He does not have anywhere near the number of public commitments that Mr. Ellison and Mr. Perez currently enjoy, but Mr. Buttigieg is trying to fashion himself as a compromise candidate if neither of the   secure a majority on the first ballot when the party gathers this month in Atlanta. Anticipating such an effort, two of the other trailing contenders used the forum to target Mr. Buttigieg. The New Hampshire Democratic chairman, Raymond Buckley, boasting of his own neutrality during the presidential primary, turned to Mr. Buttigieg at one point and reminded him of his endorsement of Mrs. Clinton. “Sorry, mayor who supported Hillary,” Mr. Buckley quipped. And Jehmu Greene, a Democratic organizer and a former Fox News contributor, chided the    Mr. Buttigieg for his frequent remark that a millennial is best suited to represent millennials. Before and after the gathering, rumors of deals being struck between competing camps swirled in the corridors of this city’s convention center, where the contenders set up booths and one candidate seeking to become the party finance chairman even sprang for a platter of crab cakes. While the hopefuls for party chairman have slightly divergent diagnoses of what went wrong last year and ideas for the best way forward, the discussion so far has largely centered on party tactics and strategy. Mrs. Clinton’s victory in the popular vote, Mr. Trump’s unpopularity and the increasingly liberal bent of the party’s grass roots have tempered any calls for moderation. “This is not going to be a philosophical battle,” said Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, the   House Democrat. Mr. Hoyer was at Saturday’s forum to support Mr. Perez, but called both his candidate and Mr. Ellison “strong progressives. ” With support from a number of governors, leading donors and Obama loyalists, Mr. Perez is clearly the preferred candidate among the Democratic establishment. That status, despite his liberal credentials, has made him a figure of suspicion among elements of the   left. “It says a lot about how much Sanders has skewed how Democrats think when the Latino labor activist from Takoma Park is considered the centrist,” said Kenneth Baer, an author and a former Obama administration official, alluding to the progressive Maryland enclave where Mr. Perez lives. At the outset of the forum here, Mr. Perez proclaimed, “I miss Barack Obama a lot, my friends. ” Yet he conceded during a television interview that the former president had not paid sufficient attention to  . He also raised eyebrows last week by telling Kansas Democrats that he agreed with the complaint from Mr. Sanders’s supporters that the primary process had been “rigged. ” Soon after, Mr. Perez wrote on Twitter that he “misspoke” and that Mrs. Clinton “became our nominee fair and square. ” The machinations have seemed rather small, though, in light of the boiling fury toward Mr. Trump. Ben Jealous, the former N. A. A. C. P. president and a supporter of Mr. Ellison, noted that the   progressive group that he helps lead had drawn 500 participants to a rally on the Eastern Shore of Maryland, and another 400 to Western Maryland, both conservative parts of the state. “Donald Trump will ensure we stay woke,” Mr. Jealous said.	1
194	This is how the muzzling starts: not with a boot on your neck, but with the fear of one that runs so deep that you muzzle yourself. Maybe it’s the story you decide against doing because it’s liable to provoke a   president to put the power of his office behind his attempt to destroy your reputation by falsely calling your journalism “fake. ” Maybe it’s the line you hold back from your script or your article because it could trigger a federal leak investigation into you and your sources (so, yeah, jail). Or, maybe it’s the commentary you spike because you’re a publicly supported news channel and you worry it will cost your station its federal financing. In that last case, your fear would be existential  —   a matter of your very survival  —   and your motivation to   could prove overwhelming. We no longer have to imagine it. We got a   example last week in San Antonio, where a PBS station sat atop the slippery slope toward censorship and then promptly started down it. It’s a single television station in a single state in a very big country. And the right thing ultimately happened. But only after a very wrong thing happened. The editorial misfire bears retelling because it showed the most likely way that the new administration’s attempts to shut down the free press could succeed, just as it shows how those attempts can be stopped. The story began with a Jan. 24 speech that Representative Lamar Smith, Republican of Texas, gave on the House floor regarding what he described as the unfair way the national media was covering President Trump. He said for instance that the media ignored highs in consumer confidence, which of course it did not. And he ended with an admonition for his constituents: “Better to get your news directly from the president. In fact, it might be the only way to get the unvarnished truth. ” His remarks caught the notice, and the ire, of a longtime San   journalist and commentator, Rick Casey, who hosts a weekly public affairs program “Texas Week” on KLRN. He ends each week’s show with his own commentary, which also runs in The San Antonio  . Mr. Casey has been able to work for “40 years as a professional smart ass,” he told me, because “I’m not really a bomb thrower  —   I’ve watched politicians for so many years that I know how to be strong about something without being unfriendly. ” But Mr. Smith’s comments bothered him enough that he wrote up a stemwinder of a closing commentary. “Smith’s proposal is quite innovative for America,” it went. “We’ve never really tried getting all our news from our top elected official. It has been tried elsewhere, however. North Korea comes to mind. ” All set to go, the commentary was mentioned in a Facebook promotion for the show, which in turn caught the eye of Mr. Smith’s office, which called the station to inquire about the segment. Forty minutes before the show aired, the station’s president and chief executive, Arthur Rojas Emerson, left a message for Mr. Casey saying he was pulling the commentary and replacing it with an older one. Mr. Casey told me he missed the call, but saw what happened with his own eyes. At a meeting the next Monday, Mr. Casey said, Mr. Emerson expressed concern “that the Corporation for Public Broadcasting was under attack and that this would add to it. ” The Corporation for Public Broadcasting provides financing for public stations, including KLRN, and Mr. Trump’s election has heightened fears that its financing will be cut. It also happens that Mr. Emerson had left journalism for several years to run his own advertising firm and that Mr. Smith had at one point been a client. Mr. Casey says he asked Mr. Emerson if he’d be willing to come on the program and discuss it all, but Mr. Emerson declined. And that seemed to be that. But as we’re learning this year, journalism has a safety net in the people who appreciate it, and the people who work in it. First, when Mr. Casey’s commentary ran as planned in The San Antonio   astute readers noticed it was different than the previous night’s televised commentary. The story of what happened began traveling around San Antonio journalism circles, making its way to the   columnist Gilbert Garcia, who shared the details last Friday.  Another titan of Texas journalism, Evan Smith, who   The Texas Tribune and regularly appears on Mr. Casey’s program, noticed Mr. Garcia’s column while he was in Washington. “I had a hot coffee in my hand and I came very close to dropping it,” Mr. Smith told me. “Holding people accountable in public life is so fundamentally important that this idea that somehow we’re going to stop doing that because we’re worried about what the government’s going to do to us, I so unbelievably reject that. ” As it happened, Evan Smith was in Washington for a meeting of the PBS national board, on which he sits, and “I certainly got into the board room and talked to people in the system. ” He also called Mr. Emerson, and told him “I didn’t see why The Tribune or I should continue to be associated with this show or this station. ” By late last week, Mr. Emerson had agreed to let Mr. Casey’s original segment run this Friday, as long as it included a new “commentary” label that will run with his opinion segments. When I caught up with Mr. Emerson this week he acknowledged making “a mistake” that should not tarnish a career spent mostly in broadcast news, starting in a $1.   job as a cameraman. “I had to make a decision in what was about 20 minutes,” he said. He acknowledged that “clearly we always worry about funding for public television,” but said that wasn’t the “principal reason” for his decision to hold back the commentary. “We have to protect the neutrality of the station  —   somebody could have looked at it as slander,” he said. The “commentary” label, he said, would take care of it. Mr. Casey is satisfied with the result. But he acknowledged that it was a close call and that he was uniquely qualified to push back in a way others might not be. “I’m lucky to be in the position of being 70 years old, and not in the position of being 45,” he said, meaning that job security was not the same issue. “There’s no level of heroism here. ” In a week in which Congress is calling for a leak investigation into stories in The Washington Post, The New York Times and CNN that led to Michael T. Flynn’s forced resignation as national security adviser, heroism is what’s called for. Hopefully there’s enough of it to go around.	1
296	WHEN POLICE KILL By Franklin E. Zimring Illustrated. 305 pp. Harvard University Press. $35. UNWARRANTED Policing Without PermissionBy Barry Friedman434 pp. Farrar, Straus  Giroux. $28. It is, to hear the new president’s posse tell it, an exceptionally dangerous and thankless time to be a police officer in the United States. In the streets, we are told, there is a “war on cops,” fired up by the activists of Black Lives Matter. In the corridors of Washington, liberals want to deny law enforcement the powers they need to keep us safe. The media runs endless video loops of a few police shootings of civilians, and the Justice Department nannies swoop in to take charge of this most local of public functions. Facing harsh scrutiny, demoralized cops hesitate to do their jobs  —   a phenomenon called “ . ” No wonder some police forces are having a hard time recruiting. Now two legal scholars challenge that bleak portrayal with timely,   arguments that, in fact, police have been given more power than they need, have too frequently abused it, and are the least accountable of our public servants. In Donald J. Trump’s    world, these assertions may be dismissed as the products of progressive academic hothouses (Franklin E. Zimring teaches law at the University of California, Berkeley Barry Friedman at New York University) but they come from reputable scholars, armed with facts and respectful of good policing. Zimring’s book, “When Police Kill,” is essentially a   riff on a single statistic: Roughly 1, 000 Americans die each year at the hands of the police. There are several remarkable things about that number. First, it is about double the official counts by agencies of the Justice Department, an extraordinary margin of error for something so important. (The higher, and now generally accepted, estimate of deadly encounters comes from investigative reporting by The Washington Post and The Guardian. The paucity of good official data as a   handicap is a major theme in both books.) Second, the civilian body count does not seem to be declining, even though violent crime generally and the   deaths of police officers are down sharply. Third, as in so many aspects of criminal justice, violence by police and against police are orders of magnitude greater than in other developed countries. (Credit our promiscuous affair with handguns.) Fourth, police kill   at more than double their share of the population, a phenomenon Zimring painstakingly demonstrates is not explained by higher crime rates in black neighborhoods. Zimring calls this “a civil rights crisis that nobody had seen on the horizon”  —   until the anger that boiled up after the 2014 shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo. and the subsequent cases recorded on bystander video. Fifth, about 400 of these targets of deadly force carried no firearm, and more than 100 had no weapon of any kind. Sixth, the average number of those 1, 000 deaths per year that result in felony convictions of a police officer: one. Zimring’s most explosive assertion  —   which leaps out of a work that is mostly   nuance  —   is that police leaders don’t care. “The circumstantial evidence suggests that police departments do not regard whether the victims of police shootings live or die as a matter of great moment,” he writes. Zimring argues that unnecessary deaths are excused by rules of engagement that encourage cops to keep firing after a suspect no longer represents a real threat, and by fake science, like the “  rule,” which holds, on the basis of no credible evidence, that a subject with a knife represents a lethal menace if he gets within 21 feet. The default assumption is that a perceived threat is real and a police killing is righteous. To Zimring’s point, the F. B. I. compiles its unaudited reports of these deaths under the rubric “Justifiable Homicide, by Weapon, Law Enforcement. ” Barry Friedman’s broader and more accessible book looks beyond the lethal use of force at the many other ways the Fourth Amendment protection against “unreasonable searches and seizures” has been ignored or stretched in the name of public safety. The   litany of invasive policing practices  —   SWAT teams, stop and frisk, sobriety roadblocks, airport security, CCTV cameras, use of informants  —   is steadily being expanded by technology to include   readers, “Stingray” cellphone interceptors, facial recognition software, warrantless collection of metadata and archives of DNA samples. Friedman’s case  —   illuminated with stories of hapless civilians encountering excesses of force or surveillance  —   is not that police should be denied the best tools, but that there should be clear rules. More often than not, the rules are ambiguous, the prosecutors are reluctant to pursue excesses because they have a symbiotic relationship with police, and judges have hesitated to apply the Constitution to perplexing questions raised by new policing capabilities. Does using an infrared heat detector to discover a pot farmer’s basement grow lights constitute a search? What about attaching a GPS device to a suspect’s car? “The authority to use force on citizens and to conduct surveillance of them  —   the powers that define policing and set it apart  —   may be necessary to maintain order, but those are the most awesome powers we grant any public servants,” Friedman writes. “We have categorically failed to offer clear guidance to policing agencies as to what they are to do (or refrain from doing). ” Friedman and Zimring say the solution to abusive policing is not ensuring prosecutors and grand juries are more independent (though they favor both). Nor should we expect an easy fix from body cams or “community policing” strategies that attempt to turn police into neighborhood ombudsmen, a job for which they have neither the will nor the training. Ultimately both writers look to police leadership, noting that the blue culture will not be moved by reforms imposed from outside. “The main arena for the radical changes necessary to save many hundreds of civilian lives . ’u2008. ’u2008. is the local police department, not the federal courts or Congress, not state government, not local mayors or city councils, not even the hearts and minds of the police officers on the streets,” Zimring writes. Courts and legislatures can bring pressure to bear, but “until police departments become willing to spend time, money and management effort on resolving conflicts without killings, nothing significant can happen. ” “Yes, the police,” Friedman agrees. “They are, after all, the experts. ” Friedman, who is a constitutional lawyer, puts much of the blame on courts for failing to demand that police show probable cause and obtain warrants, and more generally for letting police invade our privacy in new ways without a prerequisite of open, democratic debate. But the ultimate culprit is us. “What’s notable is that when there is transparency, when public dialogue occurs, policy unequivocally does change,” Friedman says. He illustrates with examples of communities where   public engagement led to regulation of Stingray cellphone intercepts, body cavity searches, the militarization of police arsenals, and stop and frisk. The   bluster of the new administration notwithstanding, there are plenty of police leaders who will concur with much of what Zimring and Friedman say. In the more enlightened police training academies, the mantra is that cops should see themselves as “guardians,” not “warriors,” and there is an increasing emphasis on   over confrontation. But these will remain exceptional unless the public demands better. To paraphrase the French philosopher Joseph de Maistre, every country gets the police it deserves.	1
45	WINNIPEG, Manitoba  —   Almost three months after Bashir Yussuf watched Donald J. Trump win the presidential election, he made his way to Noyes, Minn. where he set off at night into the   woods and crawled across the unmarked border into Canada. “I saw what was coming,” said Mr. Yussuf, 28, who fled his home in Somalia in 2013 to make a circuitous,   voyage to San Diego, where he applied for asylum but was rejected. “I knew Trump was going to deport me. ” After a   walk, much of it through deep drifts, Mr. Yussuf arrived in Emerson, a small farming town in sight of the   border with both North Dakota and Minnesota. Emerson’s 700 inhabitants have long known “border hoppers,” often offering them lifts to the nearby Canadian Border Services Agency office. But they have never seen them coming in these numbers. The morning before Mr. Yussuf arrived with another Somali last Sunday night, 19 other Africans had emerged on the Canadian side of the border, cold and hungry after walking much of the night across frozen farm fields. There were too many to fit into the small border office for processing, so the people of the town rushed to open the community hall, where the new arrivals could get warm, doze on sleeping mats and refuel on Nutella sandwiches, tea and coffee. Noting a worrying trend, Emerson officials convened an emergency meeting on Thursday with the police and border agents to figure out a protocol for the next wave of arrivals  —   which they feared would be soon. “The farmers are worried about what they’re going to find when the snow melts,” said Greg Janzen, the reeve, or chief elected executive, of the   municipality. On Christmas Eve, two Ghanaians were picked up on the roadside north of town, some 10 hours after they had set off into a field near the border, sinking to their waists in snow. The temperature that morning was reported to be below zero, with windchill making it even worse. The men’s hands were so badly frostbitten that they lost almost all their fingers. Over the past couple of years, a small number of people have been sneaking across the border at Manitoba from the United States and then filing for asylum, Canadian Border Service Agency statistics show. But since the fall, refugee workers in Winnipeg say, there has been a noticeable surge. The Manitoba Interfaith Immigration Council, known locally as Welcome Place, typically serves 50 to 60 asylum seekers per year, said its executive director, Rita Chahal. “Since April, we’ve seen already 300,” she said. While the government of Canada was unable to provide statistics on the number of people seeking refugee status who illegally enter the country, Sgt. Harold Pfleiderer of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police said, “There has been an increase in illegal migration in Quebec, Manitoba and British Columbia, with the largest increase being seen in Quebec. ” A loophole in the rules covering asylum seekers has led some to walk for as long as eight hours in the middle of the night, through wintry landscapes and biting prairie cold, before arriving in Emerson. While an agreement between Canada and the United States makes it impossible for them to simply present themselves at the border and claim asylum, those who make it into the country and then present themselves to border guards can do so. Now, in light of the uncertainty and disruption created by President Trump’s executive order on immigration, refugee advocates and human rights groups in Canada are demanding that the government led by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau suspend or cancel the refugee pact, which is known as the Safe Third Country agreement. “We are essentially encouraging people to come across the border through irregular means,” said Sean Rehaag, a York University law professor who specializes in refugee and immigration law. On Wednesday, the immigration and refugee clinical program at Harvard Law School issued a report stating that Mr. Trump’s executive orders on immigration made the United States “not a safe country of asylum” for people fleeing persecution and violence. “When Canada sends someone back to the U. S. we are saying we have confidence the U. S. is going to protect them if they need protection. We don’t see how we can have confidence to say that in the current context,” said Janet Dench, executive director of the Canadian Council For Refugees, a nonprofit umbrella organization of 170 refugee advocacy groups. Bashir Khan, a Winnipeg lawyer, has represented 125 refugees before the Immigration and Refugee Board over the past five years. That is on top of the 17 he is representing currently. All were rejected at refugee hearings in the United States. “Let’s be honest here,” Mr. Khan said. “They did not get access to justice in the United States. They were locked up from the moment they crossed the Mexican border, and detained an average of nine months. They didn’t know how to fill out asylum forms, they were not given legal aid  —   not one of them. ” Ms. Chahal of Welcome Place said that in recent months her center had seen another type of applicant  —   people like Mourad Hassan, who flew into Chicago in December and then worked immediately to find a way across the border to make his first asylum claim in Canada. “When Trump became president, I was scared he would deport me,” said Mr. Hassan, 32, a former army officer from Djibouti who said he had been tortured for political reasons. “He doesn’t like Muslims. ” From Emerson, the refugee applicants typically take cabs for the   trip to the provincial capital of Winnipeg, where they formally apply for asylum, welfare checks and legal aid. The hearings are usually scheduled within two to three months of their application, but there are no guarantees. In 2015 the Immigration and Refugee Board approved 57. 7 percent of the 16, 521 refugee claims made inside Canada’s borders. The   board does not track how many claims come from people who bypassed border controls to enter Canada. With the legal status of Mr. Trump’s executive order still in limbo, Canada’s government has shown no enthusiasm for suspending its agreement with Washington. On Friday, Camielle Edwards, a spokeswoman for Ahmed Hussen, the immigration minister, said that the agreement “remains an important tool for Canada and the U. S. to work together on the orderly handling of refugee claims made in our countries. ” She said, “The conditions of the agreement continue to be met, but we are continuing to monitor the situation closely. ” Ms. Dench said that history suggests that Canada’s border will not be overwhelmed by refugee claimants if people entering from the United States are allowed to apply at the border. “It’s not as if everyone in the U. S. would suddenly want to come to Canada,” she said. And, she said, “We would not have more people crossing the border irregularly and you no longer have people losing their fingers. ” Mr. Yussuf was prepared for his journey to Emerson. He wore thermal underwear and thick gloves. And he paid a guide $600 to take him close to the border. Other asylum seekers said that they had heard from cabdrivers in Grand Forks, N. D. that they would be deported at the border. The drivers offered to drive them to a place that was better for crossing illegally, but farther from the border. They were unprepared for the wintry crossing. One man, Zurekaneni Issah Adams, wore a thin jean jacket and carpentry gloves. His trip took seven hours. “We were lucky. We were saved by God,” said Mr. Adams, 36, who fled Ghana in 2014 for Brazil, before slowly making his way by foot, bus and boat to the California border. After 16 months in detention, Mr. Adams said, his asylum request there was rejected. In Canada, he had a hearing scheduled last week, but it was postponed. “I am dreaming big,” he said. “I will not lose my hope. ”	1
617	 A group of minutemen watching the Mexican Border for illegal migrants and drug traffickers, have proceeded to the citizen arrest of two men in an SUV, carrying 1300 pounds of cocaine. The volunteers were completely astonished when the two arrestees pulled out CIA ID cards and explained they were actually carrying the drug as part of their duties and that the cargo belonged to the Central Intelligence Agency.The incident took place last night, in the Chihuahuan desert, near the Texan city of El Paso. A group of seven minutemen saw a large black SUV drive rapidly across the border. They chased the vehicle in their own trucks and achieved to immobilize it after a chase of more than 15 miles.The vigilantes arrested the two men on board and called the border patrol, who proceeded to search the vehicle. They discovered dozens of packages of cocaine, totalling an incredible 618.4 kilograms (1363 pounds).

317	PEORIA, Ariz.  —   Wil Myers hates the feeling of batting gloves, so he never wears them. This time of year, especially, he spends a lot of quality time with his bats, twirling them like batons in the San Diego Padres’ clubhouse, gripping and waggling them around in his massive hands. He needs to build up calluses on his palms. “They’re a little soft now,” said Myers, the Padres’ first baseman. “I’m already cracking there a little bit. ” Feelings are raw, too, on the San Diego sports scene. The departure of the Chargers for Los Angeles last month did not hit Myers personally he is not a football fan, not even of the Carolina Panthers, who play less than a mile from his   home in North Carolina. But the Chargers’ move leaves the Padres as the only major pro sports team in town, and a singular entity in baseball. Every other team in the majors has at least one neighbor in the N. F. L. the N. B. A. or the N. H. L. Only the Padres have a whole market to themselves. Yet after their sixth losing season in a row, at   they cannot offer a winning alternative to soothe the loss of the Chargers. “It stings, collectively, throughout the city, and everybody feels that,” Padres Manager Andy Green said. “I don’t think it’s really our responsibility to try to replace the Chargers I don’t think we’re capable of doing that, nor are we trying to do that. But we’re going to try to rally this city together behind a team that is building something for the future of San Diego and recognizing that we’re San Diego’s team. ” The Padres have been San Diego’s team since 1969, when they joined the National League as a    expansion franchise that lost 110 games. All these years later, in generic white and navy, they still have not won a championship. The Chargers never won a Super Bowl, either they were routed in their only appearance, in 1995, just as the Padres were swiftly beaten in the World Series of 1984 and 1998. The memory of that latter run, at least, sustains the current group. “You talk to Trevor Hoffman, and he talks about what the fans were like when they were making their World Series push,” said Austin Hedges, a young catcher who lives in town, speaking of the Padres’ former star closer. “It’s an incredible city that loves their sports teams. We don’t really think about the Chargers being gone we just know what we’re capable of and what we want to bring to the city, and that’s a championship. ” For this season, anyway, the Padres might be further from that goal than any other team. They recently signed Myers, who had 28 homers and 28 steals last season, to a   $83 million contract extension. But several positions are unsettled, and with few reliable starters, Green has said he may consider a piggyback style of game management, with starters replaced quickly by long relievers. Far below the surface, though, the Padres believe they are positioned well. Last summer, with several   teams restricted in their spending allotments, General Manager A. J. Preller poured $70 million into the draft and international markets. He also made several trades for prospects, bolstering a farm system whose talent level has risen to third in baseball, from 20th, in rankings by ESPN’s Keith Law. Only the Braves and the Yankees rank higher. Preller was perhaps too aggressive in his trades he was suspended for a month late last season after the commissioner’s office determined the Padres had not provided complete medical records to rival teams. But the result of the whirlwind season, Preller hopes, will be the kind of foundation that has helped his old team, the Texas Rangers, win throughout this decade. “When you build something, you’re not trying to be mediocre, where you have a team that, if you hit everything, can win 85 games and get a wild card,” he said. “Hopefully you’re able to build it where you’ve got a chance to have a window for a number of years and you have waves of talent coming in, so even if you don’t get a lot of things right, you still have so much depth and so many players that you can have a chance to win   games every year and compete for a World Series. That’s the   we have, and I think the fans understand. ” Soon after the Padres hired Preller in August 2014, he engineered a flurry of trades for veterans like Matt Kemp, Craig Kimbrel and Justin Upton. The fans responded, with attendance rising to 2. 45 million in 2015, the highest since 2007, when the Padres were coming off consecutive division titles. But when the 2015 team flopped, Preller pivoted quickly, dealing away some of the newcomers and letting others leave for   compensation. While one trade backfired badly (acquiring Kemp from the Dodgers for catcher Yasmani Grandal) it was a worthwhile strategy the Padres needed a jolt, and Preller had planned to rebuild the farm system, anyway. He said it was healthy to raise expectations at the start, so fans would understand that the team would try anything to win. “You find out a lot when people expect you to do well,” Preller said. “Sometimes it can be easier when people view you as the underdog and there’s not a lot of expectation on exactly what you’re going to do. When you really have it going well is when you have expectations for your franchise and you’re able to meet or exceed those expectations every year. That’s the franchise we want to get to, and we’re hopefully building toward that. ” The Padres acquired their best prospect, the    center fielder Manuel Margot, before last season in a trade with the Boston Red Sox. Last summer, in the Futures Game in San Diego, Margot made a leaping catch to rob a home run. He returned for a   cameo after hitting . 304 with 30 steals in Class AAA. “Manny Margot is a really exciting baseball player,” Green said. “He plays with a big smile on his face. He flies around the field. He’s kind of a slasher at the plate who’s going to hit the ball all over the yard, take competitive   and be a real threat on the basepaths. ” Padres fans have heard about prospects before, of course every losing team likes to promote its future. The difference now is that fans have no local alternative. The spotlight is theirs, and the Padres promise a good performance. They just need time. “We could become very popular,” Myers said. “We start winning, the city rallies around us  —   once we do take that next step to being a great team, I think it could be really cool for the city. ”	1
671	 Atlanta, Georgia has been known for it’s population of homesexual African American men for the past few years, but until recently, this popular opinion was simply a stereotype.… Georgia State University students began a study assessing the sexuality of the male population of the city with surprising results … ​The study divided the population into categories of black, white, Asian, and oreo, then divided them further into heterosexual, homosexual, bisexual, pansexual, and asexual. Upon completion of the study, it was found that 80% of the black men in Atlanta, Georgia are homosexual.However, due to the large amount of men unwilling to openly admit to being anything other than straight in our society, it is expected that the actual percentage of homosexual black men in Atlanta is much larger.	0
763	   A gruesome story coming out of Grand Haven, Michigan has residents at this small town shocked and disturbed. Marjorie Reynolds, 91, was described as a quiet elderly women who waved at strangers and neighbors as they walked by. But Reynolds had a more sinister nature, as neighbors are learning, after 19 missing neighborhood cats were found dead in her home. Not just dead, however, but skinned and cured — with some of them made into purses.Yes, purses.

406	HOUSTON  —   The Justice Department on Monday dropped a crucial objection to Texas’ strict   law, signaling a significant change from the Obama administration on   issues. The   Texas Legislature passed one of the toughest voter ID laws in the country in 2011, requiring voters to show a driver’s license, passport or other   photo ID before casting a ballot. The Obama administration’s Justice Department sued Texas to block the law in 2013 and scored a major victory last year after a federal appeals court ruled that the law needed to be softened because it discriminated against minority voters who lacked the required IDs. Opponents of the law said Republican lawmakers selected IDs that were most advantageous for   white voters and discarded IDs that were beneficial to   minority voters. For example, legislators included licenses to carry concealed handguns, which are predominantly carried by whites, and excluded government employee IDs and public university IDs, which are more likely to be used by blacks, Hispanics and   younger voters. But the Justice Department under President Trump and Attorney General Jeff Sessions told a judge on Monday that it was withdrawing its claim that Texas enacted the law with a discriminatory intent. The Justice Department remains a party in the case. But it is pulling back at a crucial phase. If a judge finds the state acted with discriminatory intent, as the Justice Department and other plaintiffs have alleged, Texas could be forced to seek federal approval before it makes any changes to its voting laws or procedures. That would have major impacts on voting rules in Texas and be a potent symbol of the ability of the federal government to be a major brake on voting discrimination nationally. “This is a complete   turn,” said Danielle Lang, a lawyer for the Campaign Legal Center, one of the groups that sued Texas and represents some of the Justice Department’s fellow plaintiffs in the voter ID case. Under the Obama administration, she added, the Justice Department was “fully committed to the case. ” “They were full partners,” Ms. Lang said. “This was their case as much as ours. ” The Texas Legislature is considering a new voter ID bill that will allow those who have difficulty obtaining the appropriate IDs to vote as long as they sign an affidavit and show more widely available types of identification, including a utility bill or a bank statement. In documents filed on Monday, the Justice Department said that in light of the recently filed bill, it was withdrawing its   claim to allow “the Texas Legislature the opportunity to rectify any alleged infirmities with its voter identification law. ” The agency added that the Supreme Court has emphasized that “federal courts should allow state legislatures the first opportunity to remedy voting rights violations. ” The decision was the second time in a week that the Trump administration retreated from the Justice Department’s stance in a major civil rights case. One week ago, the department  —   with the backing of Mr. Trump  —   withdrew a policy imposed by the Obama administration to give federal   protections to transgender students in schools. Mr. Sessions, who was battered by Democrats at his confirmation hearing over his opposition in the Senate to some voting and civil rights measures, pushed for the reversal on the transgender issue over the objections of Betsy DeVos, the education secretary, officials said. The reversal in the Texas case was all the more striking because it came just three months after the Justice Department, under the Obama administration, filed a brief arguing on behalf of the very issue it backed away from Monday  —   that the Legislature intentionally sought to discriminate when it approved the law. Under the Trump administration, the Civil Rights Division of the Justice Department is expected to undergo the most severe shift in philosophy of any section under the Trump administration, and Mr. Sessions appears to be quickly meeting those expectations. On a number of civil rights and voting measures during his days in the United States Senate, Mr. Sessions saw the federal government as improperly meddling in issues he said should best be left to the states. Mr. Sessions took that same states’ rights approach last week on the transgender issue, saying the Obama administration had overreached. Other important voting rights decisions loom for the Justice Department. Perhaps the most closely watched is in North Carolina, where the courts have ruled that a voting measure was devised specifically to disenfranchise minorities. The Justice Department under the Obama administration helped fight to overturn the law, but Mr. Sessions has not said what he will do. The move on Monday in Texas came before a federal judge in Corpus Christi was scheduled to hear arguments on the   issue on Tuesday. The case will proceed because the parties that sued Texas  —   including voters, elected officials, civil rights organizations and black and Hispanic advocacy groups  —   will continue the lawsuit. “We stay the course,” said Kristen Clarke, the president and executive director of the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, which is part of the legal team representing the Texas branch of the N. A. A. C. P. and the Mexican American Legislative Caucus. But the reversal by the Justice Department  —   after a team of lawyers in the Civil Rights Division spent more than three years and more than $1 million on the case  —   angered Texas Democrats and advocates for voting rights. The Justice Department’s involvement in Texas’ voter ID law predates the lawsuit it filed against the state in 2013. The agency has been formally reviewing the law for nearly six years, starting in 2011, and made its first official objection to aspects of it in March 2012. “I am appalled and disgusted that D. O. J. would abandon their claims, that they have advocated for years, that Texas’ photo ID law was enacted with a racially discriminatory purpose,” said J. Gerald Hebert, a lawyer who represents several of those who sued Texas, including the League of United Latin American Citizens and Marc Veasey, a Democratic Texas congressman who is  . Officials from the Justice Department and the Texas attorney general’s office declined to comment on the case. In July, the most conservative federal appeals court in the country  —   the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, in New Orleans  —   found that the law had a discriminatory effect on minority voters and set in motion a loosening of the ID rules for the November elections. The judge in Corpus Christi  —   Judge Nelva Gonzales Ramos, of the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas, who oversaw a trial on the voter ID case in 2014  —   is weighing the evidence on whether Texas enacted the law with a racially discriminatory intent. If the judge finds discriminatory intent, Texas could be forced to seek federal approval before it makes any changes to its voting laws or procedures. For decades, Texas and several other mostly Southern states with a history of discrimination had been required to seek advance federal approval before making changes to their voting laws. But Texas and the other states were freed from that requirement in 2013, after a Supreme Court decision that invalidated key provisions of the Voting Rights Act. A finding of intentional discrimination, however, could once again put Texas under federal supervision, making it the first state brought back into   preclearance since the Supreme Court’s 2013 ruling. The Texas attorney general, Ken Paxton, as well as his predecessor, Greg Abbott, who is now governor, have denied that the Legislature intentionally discriminated against minority voters, arguing that the law was aimed at preventing voter fraud. But critics say the law has more to do with suppressing the turnout of those likely to vote Democratic than preventing fraud. Whatever the case, Richard L. Hasen, a law professor at the University of California, Irvine, and an   expert, said he saw the Justice Department’s action on Monday as “a sign of things to come. ” “This is the first step in what I expect to be a series of steps, with D. O. J. siding with the state of Texas,” he said. He added that by remaining in the case, the Justice Department “could actually do Texas more good than by getting out. ”	1
1	WASHINGTON  —   The White House on Thursday “counseled” Kellyanne Conway, one of President Trump’s top advisers, in an unusual show of displeasure after she urged consumers to buy fashion products marketed by Ivanka Trump, the president’s daughter. Legal experts said Ms. Conway might have violated a federal ethics rule against endorsing products or promoting an associate’s financial interests. “Go buy Ivanka’s stuff is what I would say,” Ms. Conway said in a Thursday morning interview with Fox News, speaking from the White House briefing room. “I’m going to give a free commercial here: Go buy it today, everybody you can find it online. ” Sean Spicer, the president’s press secretary, would not elaborate on what the counseling entailed. Jason Chaffetz, the Republican chairman of the House Oversight Committee, said Ms. Conway’s comments were “wrong, wrong, wrong, and there’s no excuse for it. ” Mr. Chaffetz  —   who so far had not acted on calls since Election Day to investigate ethics issues related to Mr. Trump  —   and the panel’s ranking Democrat, Elijah Cummings, formally asked the Office of Government Ethics for an inquiry. Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington and Public Citizen, nonprofit advocacy groups, sent their own requests to the ethics office to investigate whether Ms. Conway’s comments went over the line. The director of the office, Walter M. Shaub Jr. has said publicly that the president needs to do more to separate himself from his businesses. Federal ethics rules state that an employee of the government’s executive branch cannot use public office for personal gain or to endorse products or services on behalf of friends or relatives. Legal experts said Ms. Conway, whose title is counselor to the president, appeared to have violated that and possibly other    rules, which do not apply to the president and vice president, but do apply to their staffs. The president and the Trump Organization continue to be targets of criticism  —   and formal requests for investigation by Democrats in Congress  —   over potential conflicts of interest because of their global business operations. A particular focus of Democratic lawmakers in Congress is Mr. Trump’s lease with the federal government on the Old Post Office building in Washington, redeveloped as the Trump International Hotel. The hotel and    Mr. Trump’s club in Palm Beach, Fla. are among the Trump properties critics see as profiting from a surge in interest because of his presidency. A lawsuit is also pending in federal court in New York, alleging that Mr. Trump is violating the Constitution by accepting payment from foreign governments at his hotels and golf courses around the world. It is one of dozens of lawsuits filed against him in recent weeks. The Trumps argue that they have taken major steps to avoid potential conflicts, including withdrawing from more than a dozen planned international deals. But the family is moving ahead with other plans, like the launch of a new hotel brand, Scion, which they hope will develop about 30 hotels around the United States, requiring approval from local governments that rely on federal aid. Ms. Conway was responding to a Trump family clash with Nordstrom, the department store chain, which has dropped Ms. Trump’s line. On Wednesday, the president used his personal and White House Twitter accounts to lash out at Nordstrom, saying that the company had treated his daughter “so unfairly. ” Those comments are the latest in a series of ethical questions about the relationship between his official role and his family’s interests. Ms. Conway’s remarks amounted to “using your government position as kind of a walking billboard for products or services offered by a private individual,” said Laurence Tribe, a professor of constitutional law at Harvard. “She is attempting quite crudely to enrich Ivanka and therefore the president’s family. ” Ordinarily, such conduct might be handled with a letter of reprimand, though it could lead to termination, legal experts said, but those decisions are largely up to the individual agency. “I think this is a violation, but I’d like to hear an argument as to why it’s not,” said Lawrence M. Noble, general counsel of the Campaign Legal Center, a nonprofit advocacy group, who was formerly the top lawyer and ethics officer at the Federal Election Commission. “She was speaking on behalf of the White House, in her official position, which makes it more serious. ” Richard W. Painter, chief ethics counsel under President George W. Bush, said Ms. Conway’s conduct would not have been tolerated in that administration. Recent events show that the president and the people close to him do not intend “to make meaningful distinctions between his official capacity as president and the Trump family business,” he said. Of Mr. Trump’s aides, Mr. Painter said, “Instead of trying to push him back on this, they’re jumping in this and shilling for the businesses alongside him. ” Nordstrom, one of several retailers to reduce or eliminate its ties to Ms. Trump’s line of clothes, jewelry and accessories, said its decision to do so was based purely on sales performance. But deep division in views of Mr. Trump have put retailers in a bind. Critics of the president have called for a boycott of   products and the stores that sell them, while his supporters have called for a boycott of stores that drop them. Ms. Conway said that Ms. Trump was being targeted by people who disliked her father. “They’re using her to get to him,” Ms. Conway said on Thursday. The president and his daughter have pledged to distance themselves from their various businesses. Ms. Trump has stepped away from her leadership role at the Ivanka Trump brand, and she and her father have resigned as executives at the Trump Organization. But recent events underscore the strong financial ties that remain. Mr. Trump will continue to receive reports on the performance of the Trump Organization, while Ms. Trump has given no indication that she plans to sell her brand. Much as her father has over the years, Ms. Trump licenses her name to various partners that manufacture and market her products. A day after Nordstrom pulled Ms. Trump’s products from its website, Neiman Marcus did the same, alluding to poor sales. Ms. Trump has no official role in the administration, but her father has included her in meetings with industry and government leaders, and her husband, Jared Kushner, is an adviser to the president. Acting as a surrogate for her father last year, she drew free attention to the Ivanka   products  —   sheath dresses, heels and jewelry  —   that she sometimes wore. That commingling created a thicket of ethical issues that became more pointed after the election. The dress she wore at the Republican National Convention, for example, was among the items presented to apparel buyers in Japan last year, as Ms. Trump’s company was finalizing a deal with a Japanese clothing company whose largest shareholder is a   bank. That deal was in its final stages when Ms. Trump joined her father’s meeting with Japan’s prime minister, Shinzo Abe, in November. A representative for Ms. Trump said she later withdrew from that deal. And in November, after her father’s election and the day after she appeared on “60 Minutes,” Ivanka Trump Fine Jewelry sent an email to fashion journalists with a photo from the interview, alerting them that the    bangle she wore in the picture was available for $10, 800. The jewelry line later apologized.	1

452	The stock market reached yet another new high on Wednesday, the latest development to make a mockery of what savvy economic commentators thought they knew about the world. Consider how things looked one year ago. The world economy seemed hopelessly trapped in a cycle of low growth and inflation. Markets recoiled at the mere possibility that the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates. Populist political insurgencies seemed to threaten yet more financial market chaos. Now, interest rates and inflation forecasts have risen substantially from last winter’s lows financial markets are shrugging off  —   or even rallying at the possibility of  —   imminent Fed rate increases and it is all taking place during Donald J. Trump’s presidency. An economy that seemed locked in some form of “secular stagnation” or “new normal” is at long last showing some signs of being in something closer to an “old normal. ” The United States manufacturing sector is showing strength, and the broader mix of market and economic data from around the world in the last few months also points to a world where a vicious economic cycle isn’t looking quite as scary and may even be ending. There can be no assurance that this pattern will continue, and there are some things to worry about on the horizon, not least that the Trump administration could follow through on some of its threats to disrupt global trade and diplomatic relations.   interest rates remain low by historical standards across most of the world, suggesting that global bond investors aren’t fully buying into a return to stronger, more consistent growth. But the pivot since Election Day is huge. The Standard  Poor’s 500 index is up 12 percent since Nov. 8, the London FTSE 100 index reached a new high Wednesday, and other global markets have grown nicely in that span.   Treasury bonds now yield 2. 45 percent, up from 1. 85 percent on Election Day, suggesting investors believe higher growth and inflation are more probable than had seemed likely just four months ago. Much of the buoyant optimism on Wall Street is driven by investors’ expectations of corporate tax cuts and deregulation under the Trump administration. But there is also some real improvement in the economic data underneath the shifts, reflecting economic forces that have been underway for years. And this resetting of expectations is evident in market data beyond the always erratic stock market. On Wednesday, that took the form of a new survey of manufacturing supply managers that showed the factory sector is expanding at a breakneck pace. As recently as August, that same index from the Institute for Supply Management was contracting. Those numbers followed positive readings on retail sales, industrial production and the job market. For years, a theory that the major world economies were stuck in a pit of “secular stagnation” had gained hold  —   the idea that low economic growth, low inflation, low interest rates and weak productivity growth were all reinforcing one another in a vicious cycle. There’s hardly enough evidence to toss that theory aside, but there are many reasons to think things are now looking up. For example, bond market prices now suggest that investors foresee consumer price inflation in the United States at 2. 03 percent a year over the coming decade  —   consistent with the 2 percent inflation the Fed aims for. It only recently reached that level, however, after being as low as 1. 2 percent in February 2016. And it’s not just the United States. Similar measures of inflation expectations have risen in Germany, Britain and other advanced economies. For a window into the changing   of investors, consider some news around the Fed this week. Tuesday afternoon, William C. Dudley, the president of the New York Fed, said in an interview that it would be fair to assume that the central bank would raise interest rates sooner rather than later, given the improving economy. “There’s no question that animal spirits have been unleashed a bit post the election,” Mr. Dudley told CNN. Fed watchers interpreted that to mean that an   increase could be on the way in   just three months after the last increase in December. Yet that did nothing to slow the 1. 4 percent gain in the Standard  Poor’s 500 on Wednesday, and may even have contributed to it, as a sign of the Fed’s confidence in the economy. A year ago, hints that the Fed would move quickly with rates would have sent markets into a tailspin. As 2016 began, Fed leaders were expecting to raise rates four times in that year, plans that helped send the stock market plummeting and measures of economic pessimism soaring. Then they backed off and only raised rates once. Since a stock market rally began on Election Day, there has been plenty of discussion about a Trump effect. And no doubt a big part of the improvement has resulted from expectations that the new president’s policies will help corporate bottom lines (and that some of the risks of his trade agenda won’t materialize). But it’s worth keeping in mind that a   Trump bump arrives as the economy is closing in on its full productive capacity. It is getting to the point where a cycle of rising wages and higher inflation necessitates higher interest rates. That, in turn, reflects policies from the Obama administration and the Fed that long predate Mr. Trump’s election. Conventional economic theory predicts that if a government tries to increase deficits at a time of full employment, the results will be some mix of higher inflation and higher interest rates, crowding out investment. So if tax cuts, more military spending and other Trumpian policies add to deficits at a time the economy is already running at full blast, rising prices and rising rates are exactly what we would expect to see.	1
478	WASHINGTON  —   In the Obama administration’s last days, some White House officials scrambled to spread information about Russian efforts to undermine the presidential election  —   and about possible contacts between associates of   Donald J. Trump and Russians  —   across the government. Former American officials say they had two aims: to ensure that such meddling isn’t duplicated in future American or European elections, and to leave a clear trail of intelligence for government investigators. American allies, including the British and the Dutch, had provided information describing meetings in European cities between Russian officials  —   and others close to Russia’s president, Vladimir V. Putin  —   and associates of   Trump, according to three former American officials who requested anonymity in discussing classified intelligence. Separately, American intelligence agencies had intercepted communications of Russian officials, some of them within the Kremlin, discussing contacts with Trump associates. The disclosures about the contacts came as new questions were raised about Attorney General Jeff Sessions’s ties to the Russians. According to a former senior American official, he met with the Russian ambassador, Sergey I. Kislyak, twice in the past year. The details of the meetings were not clear, but the contact appeared to contradict testimony Mr. Sessions provided Congress during his confirmation hearing in January when he said he “did not have communications with the Russians. ” Mr. Sessions said in a statement late Wednesday that he “never met with any Russian officials to discuss issues of the campaign. ” “I have no idea what this allegation is about,” he said. “It is false. ” Mr. Trump has denied that his campaign had any contact with Russian officials, and at one point he openly suggested that American spy agencies had cooked up intelligence suggesting that the Russian government had tried to meddle in the presidential election. Mr. Trump has accused the Obama administration of hyping the Russia story line as a way to discredit his new administration. At the Obama White House, Mr. Trump’s statements stoked fears among some that intelligence could be covered up or destroyed  —   or its sources exposed  —   once power changed hands. What followed was a push to preserve the intelligence that underscored the deep anxiety with which the White House and American intelligence agencies had come to view the threat from Moscow. It also reflected the suspicion among many in the Obama White House that the Trump campaign might have colluded with Russia on election email hacks  —   a suspicion that American officials say has not been confirmed. Former senior Obama administration officials said that none of the efforts were directed by Mr. Obama. Sean Spicer, the Trump White House spokesman, said, “The only new piece of information that has come to light is that political appointees in the Obama administration have sought to create a false narrative to make an excuse for their own defeat in the election. ” He added, “There continues to be no there, there. ” As Inauguration Day approached, Obama White House officials grew convinced that the intelligence was damning and that they needed to ensure that as many people as possible inside government could see it, even if people without security clearances could not. Some officials began asking specific questions at intelligence briefings, knowing the answers would be archived and could be easily unearthed by investigators  —   including the Senate Intelligence Committee, which in early January announced an inquiry into Russian efforts to influence the election. At intelligence agencies, there was a push to process as much raw intelligence as possible into analyses, and to keep the reports at a relatively low classification level to ensure as wide a readership as possible across the government  —   and, in some cases, among European allies. This allowed the upload of as much intelligence as possible to Intellipedia, a secret wiki used by American analysts to share information. There was also an effort to pass reports and other sensitive materials to Congress. In one instance, the State Department sent a cache of documents marked “secret” to Senator Benjamin Cardin of Maryland days before the Jan. 20 inauguration. The documents, detailing Russian efforts to intervene in elections worldwide, were sent in response to a request from Mr. Cardin, the top Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee, and were shared with Republicans on the panel. “This situation was serious, as is evident by President Obama’s call for a review  —   and as is evident by the United States response,” said Eric Schultz, a spokesman for Mr. Obama. “When the intelligence community does that type of comprehensive review, it is standard practice that a significant amount of information would be compiled and documented. ” The opposite happened with the most sensitive intelligence, including the names of sources and the identities of foreigners who were regularly monitored. Officials tightened the already small number of people who could access that information. They knew the information could not be kept from the new president or his top advisers, but wanted to narrow the number of people who might see the information, officials said. More than a   current and former officials described various aspects of the effort to preserve and distribute the intelligence, and some said they were speaking to draw attention to the material and ensure proper investigation by Congress. All spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were discussing classified information, nearly all of which remains secret, making an independent public assessment of the competing Obama and Trump administration claims impossible. The F. B. I. is conducting a   counterintelligence investigation into Russia’s meddling in the election, and is examining alleged links between Mr. Trump’s associates and the Russian government. Separately, the House and Senate intelligence committees are conducting their own investigations, though they must rely on information collected by the F. B. I. and intelligence agencies. On Wednesday, a Justice Department official confirmed that Mr. Sessions had two conversations with Ambassador Kislyak last year, when he was still a senator, despite testifying at his Jan. 10 confirmation hearing that he had no contact with the Russians. At that hearing, Mr. Sessions was asked what he would do if it turned out to be true that anyone affiliated with the Trump team had communicated with the Russian government in the course of the campaign. He said he was “not aware of any of those activities. ” “I have been called a surrogate at a time or two in that campaign and I didn’t have  —   did not have communications with the Russians, and I’m unable to comment on it,” Mr. Sessions said at the time. However, Justice officials acknowledged that Mr. Sessions had spoken with Mr. Kislyak twice: once, among a group of ambassadors who approached him at a Heritage Foundation event during the Republican National Convention in Cleveland in July and, separately, in an office meeting on Sept. 8. The contacts were first reported by The Washington Post. Sarah Isgur Flores, Mr. Sessions’s spokeswoman, said “there was absolutely nothing misleading about his answer” because he did not communicate with the ambassador in his capacity as a Trump campaign surrogate. She said Mr. Sessions had at least 25 conversations in 2016 with ambassadors from a range of nations  —   including Britain, Japan, China, Germany and Russia  —   while on the Senate Armed Services Committee. The revelation prompted congressional Democrats to issue a torrent of statements reiterating their demands that Mr. Sessions recuse himself from overseeing any investigation into Russia’s contacts with the Trump campaign. So far, Mr. Sessions has demurred. Representative Adam B. Schiff, the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said in a statement on Wednesday that if the reports about Mr. Sessions were accurate, “it is essential that he recuse himself from any role in the investigation of Trump campaign ties to the Russians. ” Mr. Schiff added, “This is not even a close call it is a must. ” Representative Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic leader of the House, called on Mr. Sessions to resign, saying on Twitter that “he is not fit to serve as the top law enforcement officer of our country. ” A White House official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, backed up Mr. Sessions late Wednesday, calling the accusations “the latest attack against the Trump administration by partisan Democrats. ” At a CNN town hall on Wednesday, Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, said he did not know if there was anything between the Trump campaign and the Russians. But he added that if there was, “it is clear to me that Jeff Sessions, who is my dear friend, cannot make this decision about Trump. ” At his confirmation hearing on Wednesday, former Senator Dan Coats, Mr. Trump’s nominee for director of national intelligence, told the Senate Intelligence Committee that “I think it’s our responsibility to provide you access to all that you need. ” Some Obama White House officials had little faith that a Trump administration would make good on such pledges, and the efforts to preserve the intelligence continued until the administration’s final hours. This was partly because intelligence was still being collected and analyzed, but it also reflected the sentiment among many administration officials that they had not recognized the scale of the Russian campaign until it was too late. The warning signs had been building throughout the summer, but were far from clear. As WikiLeaks was pushing out emails stolen from the Democratic National Committee through online publication, American intelligence began picking up conversations in which Russian officials were discussing contacts with Trump associates, and European allies were starting to pass along information about people close to Mr. Trump meeting with Russians in the Netherlands, Britain and other countries. But what was going on in the meetings was unclear to the officials, and the intercepted communications did little to clarify matters  —   the Russians, it appeared, were arguing about how far to go in interfering in the presidential election. What intensified the alarm at the Obama White House was a campaign of cyberattacks on state electoral systems in September, which led the administration to deliver a public accusation against the Russians in October. But it wasn’t until after the election, and after more intelligence had come in, that the administration began to grasp the scope of the suspected tampering and concluded that one goal of the campaign was to help tip the election in Mr. Trump’s favor. In early December, Mr. Obama ordered the intelligence community to conduct a full assessment of the Russian campaign. In the weeks before the assessment was released in January, the intelligence community combed through databases for an array of communications and other information  —   some of which was months old by then  —   and began producing reports that showed there were contacts during the campaign between Trump associates and Russian officials. The nature of the contacts remains unknown. Several of Mr. Trump’s associates have done business in Russia, and it is unclear if any of the contacts were related to business dealings. The New York Times, citing four current and former officials, reported last month that the American authorities had obtained information of repeated contacts between Mr. Trump’s associates and senior Russian intelligence officials. The White House has dismissed the story as false. Since the Feb. 14 article  appeared, more than a   officials have confirmed contacts of various kinds between Russians and Trump associates. The label “intelligence official” is not always cleanly applied in Russia, where   oligarchs and government officials often report back to the intelligence services and elsewhere in the Kremlin. Steven L. Hall, the former head of Russia operations at the C. I. A. said that Mr. Putin was surrounded by a cast of characters, and that it was “fair to say that a good number of them come from an intelligence or security background. Once an intel guy, always an intel guy in Russia. ” The concerns about the contacts were cemented by a series of phone calls between Mr.  Kislyak and Michael T. Flynn, who had been poised to become Mr. Trump’s national security adviser. The calls began on Dec. 29, shortly after Mr. Kislyak was summoned to the State Department and informed that, in retaliation for Russian election meddling, the United States was expelling 35 suspected Russian intelligence operatives and imposing other sanctions. Mr. Kislyak was irate and threatened a forceful Russia response, according to people familiar with the exchange. But a day later, Mr. Putin said his government would not retaliate, prompting a Twitter post from Mr. Trump praising the Russian president  —   and puzzling Obama White House officials. On Jan. 2, administration officials learned that Mr. Kislyak  —   after leaving the State Department meeting  —   called Mr. Flynn, and that the two talked multiple times in the 36 hours that followed. American intelligence agencies routinely wiretap the phones of Russian diplomats, and transcripts of the calls showed that Mr. Flynn urged the Russians not to respond, saying relations would improve once Mr. Trump was in office, according to multiple current and former officials. Beyond leaving a trail for investigators, the Obama administration also wanted to help European allies combat a threat that had caught the United States off guard. American intelligence agencies made it clear in the declassified version of the intelligence assessment released in January that they believed Russia intended to use its attacks on the United States as a template for more meddling. “We assess Moscow will apply lessons learned,” the report said, “to future influence efforts worldwide, including against U. S. allies. ”	1
981	 A hundred and nineteen years after the Treaty of Paris, which enabled the transfer of ownership of Puerto Rico from Spain to the United States, Madrid and Washington have virtually finalized an agreement to return the jurisdiction of the Caribbean island to the European country, endi.com sources have confirmed. The deal, which has been negotiated in secret for at least two years, is not yet official, but it has the approval of Presidents Donald Trump of the United States and Mariano Rajoy of Spain and certain technical details are all that remain to finalize. An announcement was expected before the end of the year, but it is possible that the emergence of last-minute complications will delay approval of the transfer until the first days of 2018. The agreement has to be approved by the US Congress, which was occupied until the last hours of his last session by federal tax reform and did not have time to address this issue.It was reported that the agreement has overwhelming support in Congress. “This has long been done. Moreover, the United States should never have taken possession of Puerto Rico. It was a mistake. Puerto Rico has cost us too much, ” said Alabama Republican Sen. Luke McCullen.

134	Emerging from the warmth of her car, Jung   watched her husband trudge up a snowy hill, red sled in hand, as their    son bounded excitedly ahead, ready for another run. Like many young South Koreans in the congested capital of Seoul, she and her husband escape to the nearby Taebaek Mountains to hit the slopes several times each winter, though she admitted they are still trying to find their legs as skiers. “We are not really good at it,” she said, “but we do enjoy the sledding. ” There’s another draw that keeps their son enthralled  —   a   indoor water park called Ocean 700, whose attractions include a wave pool, a lazy river filled with bobbing   and a waterslide with the slightly intimidating name of Tornado. In fact, Ms. Jung, a    bank employee, thought the ski season was over on this particular trip in   last year, when some of the smaller resorts began to close, so her family had come only for the waterslides. “It’s very popular in Korea. Maybe even more than the skiing. ” Indeed, compared with neighboring Japan and its ingrained ski culture,   skiing and   resorts, South Korea is in many ways still coming into its own as a skiing and snowboarding destination. But this could soon change when Pyeongchang hosts the Winter Olympics from Feb. 9 to 25, 2018, only the third time the Winter Games will be held in Asia, and the first time outside Japan. It’s a big moment for the country, which views the Winter Games as a huge source of national pride and is eager to put on a memorable spectacle on par with the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul and the 2002 World Cup that South Korea   with Japan. With tens of thousands of athletes, journalists and spectators expected to descend on Pyeongchang for the Games, it’s also a   party of sorts for South Korea as a winter sports hub, a chance to show the world that it, too, has   slopes and a   skiing infrastructure that can continue to attract powder hounds long after the Olympics are over. This quiet region of   mountains and potato fields not far from the North Korean border, long one of the country’s   areas, has overcome a number of obstacles just to get to this point. Pyeongchang, largely unfamiliar even to many Koreans before the Olympic bid, was once seen as a sizable underdog to win the Olympics. It finally succeeded in its third bid after   defeats to Vancouver in 2010 and Sochi in 2014. Still, name recognition remains a problem. To avoid confusion with the North Korean capital of Pyongyang, the Olympic host  was officially rebranded from its original name, Pyongchang, to PyeongChang, adding an   “e” and capital “C. ” The new spelling only partly worked, though, as some international media have not adopted the capital C.  And travelers have still gotten confused, such as the Kenyan delegate headed to the ski center for a United Nations biodiversity conference in 2014 who accidentally booked a ticket to North Korea instead. The preparations have also been rocky. There were struggles initially to find domestic sponsors and disputes over funding for venues and the plan to build a downhill course in a virgin forest on a protected mountainside. (The organizing committee has done damage control by promising to replant trees and return the mountain to its natural state after the Games.) The   corruption scandal involving the country’s president, Park   has threatened to overshadow the Olympics, too, but organizers maintain that preparations have not been affected and that the Games are free of corruption. With one year to go before the opening ceremony, organizers are fervently trying to shift attention back to South Korea’s moment in the sporting spotlight. Most of the venues are nearing completion, including a   Alpine ski center, speedskating oval, figure skating arena and sliding track for the bobsled, luge and skeleton events. The two villages for athletes are about    —   one in the Pyeongchang mountain cluster, the other in the coastal city of Gangneung, where the ice events will be held. A new   rail line is expected to be completed by   too, whisking visitors from Seoul to Pyeongchang in just 69 minutes, compared with the current      drive. And the Olympic spirit is finally starting to seep into Pyeongchang, a sprawling county made up of ski resorts and sleepy towns like Hoenggye, where the athletes’ village and Olympic Stadium are being built. Hoenggye is as far from a typical ski town as it gets. The streets are lined with homey dumpling and Korean fried chicken restaurants, as well as nondescript clothing stores with names like Barbie Fashion Shop that stock   sweaters and windbreakers, but nary a ski jacket in sight. A small truck with a squawking loudspeaker makes the rounds in the afternoons selling fresh crab and squid from the coast, and on the outskirts of town, locals hang pollock on wooden racks for days in the winter sun until they become tough as leather, a popular Korean delicacy called hwangtae. But even in this tranquil hamlet, the excitement is starting to build. The main road into town is already aglow with giant neon letters proclaiming triumphantly to motorists, “Yes Pyeongchang!” In a dry, shallow riverbed, five giant Olympic rings were fashioned from packed snow for the Pyeongchang Winter Festival earlier this year, with tunnels in the curved walls large enough to stroll through and snow carvings of figures like a skiing rooster (for the Year of the Rooster) and the Olympic mascot Soohorang, a smiling white tiger, in the center. A short drive away, the new Alpensia Ski Jumping Center has also become a draw for families, with young children bundled in heavy jackets warily eyeing the top of the steep, icy slope before heading to the observatory for popcorn and photos in front of a less frightening picture of the real thing. The hope is that the Olympics can have a lasting impact on the tourism industry here and help South Korea rival Japan  —   and upstart China  —   as a winter sports destination. It may take some time to catch up to its neighbors. According to the Ski Business Association of Korea, the number of ski visits in South Korea grew slowly from 5. 4 million in   to a peak of 6. 8 million in   but then fell to just 4. 9 million in   in part because of a slowing economy and an aging population. Japan’s ski industry has also seen a sharp decline since the boom years of the 1980s, but still averages more than 30 million ski visits per year. Though the downturn has hit some resorts hard, the attractions in Japan are still legion:   resorts with dozens of trails and steep verticals a lengthy ski season that sometimes stretches into early May a raucous   scene (particularly popular among   Australians) and above all, the endlessly falling snow. In China, meanwhile, skiing is also booming among the newly rich and young urban dwellers, with more than 12. 5 million resort visits registered in  . Developers have been pouring money into resorts across the country, none more grand than the $3. 2 billion Changbaishan resort near the North Korean border, which is now one of the largest in Asia with 43 trails totaling nearly 20 miles. China is sure to attract even more investment as it gears up for its own Winter Olympics in Beijing in 2022. South Korea actually has a long skiing history. Its first (and still biggest) resort, Yongpyong, opened in 1975, the same year it imported its first   machine from Europe. (This moment is memorialized at Yongpyong in a grainy photo of officials surveying the foreign contraption above the very   caption: “This artificial snow makes skiing more enjoyable. ”) But one of the main impediments to the country emerging from Japan’s shadow has been geography: South Korea’s mountains are just smaller than its neighbors’ and receive far less natural snow. At Yongpyong, which will host the slalom and giant slalom events during the Olympics, the average annual snowfall is just eight feet, and though it’s cold enough to make artificial snow the entire winter, it’s not quite the same as the deep powder in Hokkaido, the northern Japanese island. At Niseko, one of the most popular resort areas on Hokkaido, the average annual snowfall is an astonishing 50 feet. Yongpyong has 28 slopes, served by 13 lifts and a gondola, but many of the trails are geared toward beginners and intermediates an experienced skier can pretty much cover all the “ ” diamond trails by lunchtime. Safety and proper decorum, not speed, also seem to be paramount concerns  —   fences prevent skiers from going   helmets are ubiquitous, and signs constantly remind visitors to select the appropriate slope for their skill level and slow down. Sharing a Korean Hite beer with friends after a morning on the slopes, Ulrike Pertoll, an Italian who lives in Seoul, said she prefers the pure powder in Japan and the longer runs in the Dolomites back in Italy. But, she added, skiing in South Korea has its benefits: Ski rentals and lodging are cheaper than in Japan, and the proximity of the slopes to Seoul means you can leave work at 5 p. m. on a Friday and be on the slopes several hours later. “Where else can you do that so easily in Asia?” she said. Yongpyong’s slopes stay open until 2:30 a. m. for night owls, too. Kyle Hughes, an Australian who has skied in South Korea for five years and runs an independent online travel guide called Korea Snow, points out other advantages: “The Koreans have the best skiing infrastructure in Asia  —   they have   gondolas, fast quads, fast eights, the latest magic carpets,” he said. “And they’ve become so efficient at making snow, it’s ridiculous. One [resort] manager told me they don’t care if it doesn’t snow, they have the technology to open the whole season. ” Then there’s the cool factor. Many Koreans started taking up snowboarding in the 1990s after a hugely popular   boy band, Seo Taiji and Boys, showed off their boarding  —   and posing  —   skills in one of their videos. Since then, snowboarding has exploded in South Korea  —   as much for the style as for the sport itself. And just like the broader Korean wave sweeping Asia in music, television and film, Korean brands are now at the forefront of snowboarding style in the region, too. These fashions are perhaps most visible at the Welli Hilli Park, a snowboarder’s paradise about an hour’s drive from Yongpyong. There are few downhill runs here rather, the main attractions are the halfpipe, moguls and snowboard ramp where tricksters in hoodies entertain one another with flips and spins, sneaking cigarettes on the side. The standard dress is a hooded sweatshirt down to the knees (and sometimes well beyond) along with hair dyed various shades of blond and   and an obligatory   baseball cap, usually covered by the hood for effect. Some boarders go for a    ensemble in a glaring shade of pink or orange the brighter the color, the bolder the fashion statement. It’s not unusual to see GoPro cameras attached to helmets and, on occasion, a rebel snowboarder with a selfie stick fully outstretched, filming himself as he recklessly, yet    carves his way down the mountain. (A clear violation of the rules, mind you.) It’s part slope, part catwalk, with skiers trying as hard as they can to get noticed. “Koreans are really into appearance,” said Max Kim, founder of an outdoor adventure company called Teamax Adventure. “When they ski, they focus on how beautiful they ski, so they like to show off, take a selfie and post on Facebook. ” Mr. Kim fancies himself a skiing purist  —   most of the time. “I just like an outfit I feel comfortable in. If I go with a girlfriend, that’s a different story  —   then I like to wear Gucci or Chanel. ” As the industry matures, Mr. Kim hopes Koreans move beyond the     aspect of the sport and try something even more daring  —   backcountry skiing on untamed mountainsides far away from the safety of groomed trails. This is difficult to do at the   resorts around Pyeongchang, but his company organizes backcountry tours to snowy Ulleung island. “When Koreans think about skiing, everyone thinks it’s about skiing in a ski resort, surrounded by a fence,” he said. “A couple years ago, people didn’t understand about backcountry skiing, but nowadays lots of people try to do this. ” There’s another change some hope could come with the Olympics: a livelier   scene. Korean resorts are decidedly   with few entertainment options after sundown. At the Alpensia Resort, a small,   facility that’s within minutes of most Olympic venues and will serve as the focal point for the Games, the only   options are a karaoke parlor, a   pool hall and a charmingly rustic bar with Hite beer on tap and a dozen varieties of chicken, from soy sauce chicken to a curiously named “cheese chicken. ” “People tend to go to a restaurant and base everything around food. Then they start drinking and have a good time, or entertain in their apartments,” said Mr. Hughes, of Korea Snow. “As an Australian, I’m used to a bar culture. ” Then again, there are some advantages to a quieter ski destination. In Japan, he noted, “there are so many Australians, I feel like I haven’t left home. When I go to Korea, we’re pretty much the only ones there. ” The Olympics Information about the 2018 Olympics in Pyeongchang is available at pyeongchang2018. . Getting There Getting to the slopes in Pyeongchang will be much easier when the   rail opens later this year the trip will be 98 minutes from Incheon International Airport and 69 minutes from downtown Seoul. Until then, both Yongpyong and Alpensia resorts have shuttles that leave from the airport several times a day (70, 000 Korean won round trip, or about $60). Renting a car is advisable for visiting more than one resort, as public transportation is limited in the mountains. Where to Stay and Ski Alpensia has three hotels within walking distance of the lifts: the   InterContinental Alpensia Resort (doubles from 135, 000 won) the   Holiday Inn Resort (doubles from 98, 600 won) and the   Holiday Inn  Suites (doubles from 102, 000 won). A   lift ticket is 69, 000 won and rentals are 29, 000 won for skis and 35, 000 won for snowboards. At Yongpyong, the main lodging option is the   Dragon Valley Hotel (doubles from 71, 000 won). A   lift ticket is 76, 000 won and   rental is 33, 000 won. Welli Hilli sells   lift tickets for 70, 000 won. Ski rental is 28, 000 won and snowboard rental is 33, 000. Ski clothing rental is available at all resorts, too.	1
481	NEWPORT NEWS, Va.  —   President Trump on Thursday used the country’s most advanced,   aircraft carrier as the    backdrop for his push to rebuild America’s armed forces with a $54 billion increase in military spending. Speaking in the hangar bay of the   Gerald R. Ford, which this year will become the nation’s largest and most powerful warship, Mr. Trump said the Navy  —   and other military services  —   must grow and modernize. “We will make it easier for the Navy to plan for the future and thus to control costs and get the best deals for the taxpayer,” the president said. “The same boat for less money, the same ship for less money, the same airplanes for less money. ” Ever the showman, Mr. Trump arrived on the carrier in dramatic style, landing on the flight deck aboard his helicopter, Marine One. He emerged with a sharp salute and wearing his trademark red Make America Great Again baseball cap. One deck below, watching on large screens, hundreds of sailors and others let up a huge cheer for the commander in chief. After touring the ship, the president was lowered to the hangar bay on the massive elevator that carries fighter jets between the decks. To the sounds of Lee Greenwood’s “God Bless the U. S. A. ,” Mr. Trump strode into the crowd  —   wearing a Gerald R. Ford baseball cap. Mr. Trump marveled at the ship’s size, calling it “4. 5 acres of combat power and sovereign U. S. territory, the likes of which there is nothing to compete. ” “It is a monument to American might that will provide the strength necessary to ensure peace,” he said. The Ford is the first of a new, more technologically advanced class of aircraft carrier, and cost about $13 billion to build after cost overruns and years of delay. But Mr. Trump did not mention those challenges, saying instead that he supports expanding to a   Navy, from the current 10. He said ships like the Ford will allow him and future presidents to project American power in distant lands. “Hopefully it’s power we don’t have to use. But if we do, they are in big, big trouble,” he said to cheers from the sailors. Mr. Trump asserted, as he did during the presidential campaign, that the Navy is now the smallest it has been since World War I. The Navy swelled from 245 ships in 1916 to a peak of over 6, 000 during World War II, downsizing between conflicts and bulking up during the Korean and Vietnam Wars. From the 1970s, the Navy gradually began to shrink to a total battle force of 275 ships as of September 2016. But that fleet includes 10 aircraft carriers, 22 cruisers, 63 destroyers, 11 amphibious assault ships and 68 submarines, 14 of which are armed with nuclear warheads. These are far more powerful than the fleets of World War II. So comparing the navies of the past and today is “like comparing the telegraph to the smartphone they’re just not comparable,” Ray Mabus, the secretary of the Navy under President Barack Obama, said in 2012. Lawmakers in both parties have already expressed deep skepticism about Mr. Trump’s military spending proposal, in part because of its potential to increase the nation’s deficit and in part because of the administration’s assertion that it would deeply slash nonmilitary spending to compensate. But the president’s desire to expand the military was a core promise during his campaign for the White House. American politicians often seek to associate themselves with the country’s enormous, gleaming war machines. Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential candidate, announced his choice of Speaker Paul D. Ryan as his running mate on the retired battleship Wisconsin. But sometimes the moment goes awry. In 2003, President George W. Bush stood on the deck of the aircraft carrier Abraham Lincoln to declare that the military phase of the Iraq war was over. He spoke in front of a banner that proclaimed “Mission Accomplished. ” The war continued for years. Aides to Mr. Trump are hoping that the images of the president on the Ford are more positive.	1
139	WASHINGTON  —   President Trump lashed out at the nation’s intelligence agencies again on Wednesday, saying that his former national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn, was brought down by illegal leaks to the news media, on a day of new disclosures about the Trump camp’s dealings with Russia during and after the presidential campaign. “From intelligence, papers are being leaked, things are being leaked,” Mr. Trump said at a White House news conference with Benjamin Netanyahu, the prime minister of Israel. “It’s a criminal action, criminal act, and it’s been going on for a long time before me, but now it’s really going on. And people are trying to cover up for a terrible loss that the Democrats had under Hillary Clinton. ” With his statement and a burst of   posts he made on Twitter, Mr. Trump tried to shift attention from damaging questions about contacts with Russia by Mr. Flynn and others close to the president, arguing that the outrage is not those contacts, but the leaks about them. He revived his charge that the allegations of a “Russian connection” were nothing more than a Democratic conspiracy, fed to a receptive news media to distract from the mistakes made by Mrs. Clinton during the campaign. The White House has said that Mr. Trump demanded Mr. Flynn’s resignation on Monday night, after it was revealed that Mr. Flynn, a retired   Army general, had misled Vice President Mike Pence and other officials about his conversations with a Russian diplomat. But on Wednesday, the president said that Mr. Flynn had “been treated very, very unfairly by the media,” undercut by “documents and papers that were illegally  —   I’d stress that, illegally  —   leaked. ” Earlier, he had posted on Twitter, “Information is being illegally given to the failing @nytimes  @washingtonpost by the intelligence community (NSA and FBI? ). Just like Russia” The New York Times and The Washington Post had reported on the contacts Mr. Flynn had with Russia’s ambassador to Washington, Sergey I. Kislyak. Mr. Flynn initially told Mr. Pence and others that he and Mr. Kislyak did not discuss matters of substance, like United States sanctions against Russia, but in the days after Mr. Trump’s inauguration, the Justice Department notified the White House that he had not been forthright about the conversations. The Times also disclosed broader contacts between Russian intelligence officials and people with ties to the Trump campaign and Mr. Trump’s business empire during and after the campaign, and other news organizations followed with similar reports. The president declined to address that revelation and, as he has at other times in recent days, took questions at his news conference only from conservative news organizations and ignored more challenging questions shouted to him as he left the podium. So far, the White House has had little success in trying to shift the narrative from the Russian contacts to accusations about the leaking of sensitive information by the intelligence agencies, as well as by the F. B. I. Mr. Trump used a similar strategy during the transition, after disclosures that the intelligence agencies presented him with a dossier containing potentially compromising  —   but unsubstantiated  —   information that Russian officials had collected on him during his travels to Russia. On Wednesday, Mr. Trump said on Twitter, “The fake news media is going crazy with their conspiracy theories and blind hatred. @MSNBC  @CNN are unwatchable. @foxandfriends is great!” The president also praised a column by Eli Lake of Bloomberg View, which criticized the selective leaking of intercepted communications between Mr. Flynn and Mr. Kislyak. Mr. Lake went on to suggest, however, that Mr. Flynn had been sacrificed to protect other officials, potentially including the president himself. Mr. Trump, as he has before, rejected allegations that his policy toward Russia was being compromised. “Crimea was TAKEN by Russia during the Obama Administration. Was Obama too soft on Russia?” he posted on Twitter.	1
220	The hardest questions pediatricians must routinely ask teenagers at checkups are those about depression and suicide. But they aren’t optional we have to ask them, every time. From 2005 to 2014, the prevalence of depression  —   that is, the chance of having a major depressive episode over the course of a year  —   increased significantly among   to    in the United States. These data come from an annual survey, the National Surveys on Drug Use and Health, in which the same structured questions are asked every year. The trend toward more depression was steeper in girls than it was in boys. Furthermore, when   to    were surveyed, there was again a significant increase in the prevalence of depression, but only among those 18 to 20. So it appears to be increasing in the population from 12 to 20. Dr. Ramin Mojtabai, a psychiatrist who is a professor in the department of mental health at the Bloomberg School of Public Health at Johns Hopkins and the first author on the study, said that there was no real increase from 2005 to 2011, but then the rise began, and got more pronounced in 2012 and 2013. Why was the prevalence of depression increasing, and why was it more intense among girls? Were adolescents actually suffering more from depression, or was it possible they were just more willing to talk about it? Dr. Mojtabai said that over the past couple of decades, teenagers have generally been more open about depression, but the researchers didn’t think that could account for the pattern they were seeing. They adjusted for the prevalence of substance abuse, and still the trend was there it wasn’t explained away by drug use or drinking. Neither could it be accounted for by looking at household composition (two parents versus one parent versus no parents). Suicide is the second leading cause of death in adolescents 15 to 19, second only to accidents, but that rate, as opposed to the incidence of depression, has actually been decreasing since the 1990s. But the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced last November that the suicide rate for younger children from 10 to 14 had increased to the point where the risk of dying by suicide was as high as the risk of dying in a traffic accident they were looking at 2014 data, the most recent available. Dr. Benjamin Shain, the head of the division of child and adolescent psychiatry at NorthShore University Health System, was the lead author on the American Academy of Pediatrics’ clinical report last summer on suicide and suicide attempts by adolescents. “When it comes to your child, in a sense statistics don’t matter, what matters is your particular child,” he said. “Pay attention to worry signs. ” Too often, he said, the parental impulse is to give advice or even step in and try to fix the problem. “What parents should do is mostly listen, that should be 90 percent of the conversation,” he said. The other 10 percent of the time, parents should not attempt to offer a solution, “but help the child problem solve. ” He raised concerns, in particular, about the impact of electronic media on adolescents. Dr. Mojtabai pointed out that the study was missing some information about factors like child abuse and neglect and about screens and digital devices, which some reports have associated with depressive symptoms. “There’s certainly evidence that cyberbullying may be connected to an increase in depression particularly among girls, maybe an increase in suicide,” Dr. Shain said. And this is an area, he said, where many parents feel at a loss about how to guide their children the parental impulse may be to take away the cellphone, which may make things worse for some adolescents. “They tend to find parent restriction of social media actually more traumatic than whatever the event was,” he said. “That’s how they connect to their peer group, that’s how they get their support, that’s how they have a conversation with their group you take this away and then you have a very isolated child. ” Over all, Dr. Mojtabai said, we need more information about whether there really is a trend here, and much more information about the teenagers’ lives. Still, it’s important for parents to be aware of the risks, both for children who are already struggling with mental health issues, and for those who may not yet have given their feelings a name. “A lot of children and adolescents have psychiatric problems that are not recognized by parents and they go untreated as a result,” he said. The signs of teenage depression include mood changes, like persistent sadness or irritability, and changes in level of functioning, such as school failure. They also include withdrawal from friends and family, a loss of interest in activities that had been important, and changes in eating and sleeping patterns, as well as some pretty nonspecific signs like lack of energy, trouble concentrating and unexplained aches and pains. Any parent of an adolescent has to wonder, of course, what’s the difference between “regular” adolescent mood swings and teenage behaviors and these warning signs. Parents need to ask themselves how severe the symptoms seem, and how persistent. When a child really seems to have changed, you can’t just write it off as adolescence. Dr. Shain pointed out that many of the warning signs are relatively nonspecific there could be many reasons adolescents might be hiding in their rooms, or bringing home significantly worse grades. “It could be depression, could be drugs, could be simply that their schoolwork is too hard,” he said. “The first step is sit and have a conversation with your child  —   what’s going on  —   the next step could be talk with teachers or bring your child to a counselor or psychiatrist. ” And though this increase in the prevalence of depression was not explained by substance abuse, it’s important to remember that substance abuse and depression have always gone together in adolescents those who report depression are more likely to have used drugs or alcohol. Identifying depression, of course, doesn’t solve the problem, and this is not an issue that lends itself to quick fixes, even with caring and supportive families. As the A. A. P. clinical report says: “Suicide risk can only be reduced, not eliminated, and risk factors provide no more than guidance. ” This can be a long and hard journey for teenagers and their families, but the message to parents, and to pediatricians, is that we have to keep asking the right questions.	1
51	REGGIO CALABRIA, Italy  —   Fighting the mafia at the very toe of Italy, Roberto Di Bella has seen a lot: children as young as 11 or 12 serving as lookouts during murders, attending drug deals and mob strategy sessions, or learning how to handle a Kalashnikov assault rifle. But it was the day he charged the younger brother of a minor he had jailed years before that he decided to take a drastic step: separating children from their mob families and moving them to a different part of Italy to break a generational cycle of criminality. “I am not taking them away for nothing,” said Mr. Di Bella, a    magistrate, president of the Reggio Calabria minors’ court. “Sons follow their fathers,” he said. “But the state can’t allow that children are educated to be criminals. ” Since he began taking children away from parents convicted of mob association in 2012, Mr. Di Bella has separated about 40 boys and girls, ages 12 to 16, from their families, in an approach that has proved as controversial as it has been effective. About a quarter of the time, mothers looking to flee the mafia’s tentacles go with them. The rest of the children are put into foster care, but Mr. Di Bella said that none of the children he had separated from their families had since committed a crime. The Justice Ministry in Italy has just codified statutes so that Mr. Di Bella’s innovation, so far limited to his corner of Calabria, can be applied to fight mafias nationwide. Some are appalled by the strategy in a country where family bonds are so cherished. Critics have called it a “  method” that overlooks the environmental factors that have made Calabria one of Italy’s poorest and most violent regions. “If Calabria stays Italy’s most underdeveloped region, it’ll keep having the most potent mafia,” said Isaia Sales, an expert and author of books on criminal organizations. “Regardless of the families. ” Even Mr. Di Bella admits to losing more than an occasional night’s sleep over taking children away from their parents. Still, he says, since he started separating the children, fathers have written to him to thank him for it. Children have told him they feel liberated. Mothers ask if he will do it for their children. The success of the approach says everything about the bonds that have made the ’Ndrangheta (pronounced    ) a strictly   business, one of Italy’s hardest mafia networks to penetrate. From its base in the south, the ’Ndrangheta has infiltrated communities even in Northern Italy and abroad, becoming one of the most powerful criminal syndications in the world, spanning Italy to South America and Australia. Specialized in international drug and weapons smuggling, it is the No. 1 cocaine supplier into Europe. The methods that keep the network tightly knit and functioning are both intimate and brutal, and for those caught up in the ’Ndrangheta’s web, difficult to escape. “We hear things that are much worse than Gomorrah,” Mr. Di Bella said, referring to an   book and movie that recounted gruesome lives inside another of Italy’s notorious mob networks, the Neapolitan Camorra. Mr. Di Bella and others are convinced that severing familial links is not only one of the most effective ways to defeat the ’Ndrangheta, but that it also restores to the children of the mob families the possibility of a normal life. Some minors end up in the program after committing the   symptomatic crimes, like gang violence or setting police cars on fire. Others become   mafiosos at a young age. The Reggio Calabria juvenile court has sentenced about 100 minors for mafia association and 50 for murder or attempted murder since the 1990s. Teenagers who come from ’Ndrangheta families have access to unlimited, if illicit, wealth, walk around with Rolex watches on their wrists, and are encouraged to neglect their education and spend time only within the family circle. “Emotionally, they are very alone,” said Enrico Interdonato, a    psychologist who has volunteered to work with Mr. Di Bella. “My job is mostly to relate to them humanly. ” “We don’t want to change anyone,” he added. “But we can help them be free to build their own conscience. ” After the children are moved to a different Italian region, the authorities can try to create the conditions for an ordinary childhood. In the last two years, mothers have started to turn to Mr. Di Bella, in the hope of saving their children from an inescapable destiny of death or prison, and sometimes to escape mafia ties themselves. Psychologists and social workers work with the children constantly. After they turn 18, the children can then choose whether to go back to Calabria. Most stay in touch with the judges and their social workers even after the program ends. But authorities can remove a child only if they can prove that he or she is physically or psychologically endangered by their families’ mafioso behavior. Separating a child from his or her family is always a wrenching decision, and one Mr. Di Bella does not take lightly. In one case, Mr. Di Bella considered revoking the decision for a    girl whose parents were both in jail for mafia association. “Her departure was so excruciating that even the policeman who accompanied her cried,” Mr. Di Bella recalled at a recent afternoon in his guarded office. “But a few days later, she called me and thanked me,” he said. The girl told him that she was finally free to be herself. She was no longer “the daughter of,” he recounted. One father, under a strict prison regime, wrote to Mr. Di Bella to thank him for the “chance you gave to my children to live in a taintless environment and to live in legality,” he said in a letter. “I am proud to grant my children a different future,” he wrote. Mr. Di Bella says he sees the project as the “future of the fight against mafias. ” But he is the first to admit that it is embryonic and underfunded. “We need specialists,” he said referring to psychologists, host families and specialized judges. “We need norms, funds and training, so that we can enlarge the scope of this project. ” After years of work with Mr. Di Bella and other prosecutors, the Justice Ministry is now ready to standardize the procedure, so that it can be applied first regionally, then nationally. “We try to start a process to provide them education and psychological help to show them that a different world is possible,” Francesco Cascini, director of the department for juvenile justice at Italy’s Ministry of Justice, said. “But we need funds for that. ” In the Reggio Calabria province, 81 towns out of 83 do not have a social worker, a significant hurdle to the process, he said. But talk of expansion alarms some. Critics say that context is more crucial than the family in the fight against the mafia, and consider the project as an admission of inability of the state to change the social and economic environment of Calabria. Mr. Sales, the author, argues that in the 19th century Italy’s Southern cities were not much different from Paris or London, overrun with poor people who were trying to survive through crime. In Northern Europe, though, the economic and social context improved, he said. “It’s a defeat to me,” Mr. Sales said of the program. “Because it implies not believing that the context can be cleaned up. ” But those like Mr. Interdonato, the psychologist who collaborates with Mr. Di Bella, are of a different mind. He recalled his experience working with a    boy who came from a ’Ndrangheta family who had been relocated. “The first message is, ‘No one knows you here, just live,” he said. “Then we start showing them how being honest doesn’t imply being a loser. ” Mr. Di Bella and others say their mission is to give the young people freedom, against long odds. “We are a bit like David against Goliath,” Mr. Di Bella said. “But the ’Ndrangheta infiltrates our community, and we try to infiltrate them culturally, making their children free to choose. ”	1
329	CHEHALIS, Wash.  —   At this small factory south of Seattle, employees make one of the most specialized products in the aerospace industry: the rubber mats that Boeing workers stand on while assembling jets. As long as there are jets and Boeing, business would seem to be steady. But even here workers are bracing for bumps and economic uncertainty over the gritty details of where aviation parts get made and who makes them. President Trump has talked about border tariffs and new trade deals that many people in aerospace fear could raise the cost of American airplanes bought by foreign airlines or governments. And if Boeing’s sales or profits suffer, its   supply chain  —   more than 13, 000 companies across the United States, and more than 1. 5 million jobs  —   would most likely feel the pain, too. At SmartCells, 50   employees and a few dozen temporary workers stamp out cushion pads on heavy machines. Executives work in a red building everyone calls the barn, and first names are the rule. Washington feels far away, but it is on just about everybody’s radar. “Let’s hit it with a    and see how it reacts, then get a plan,” said Bob Bishop, the chief operations officer at SmartCells, describing Mr. Trump’s   style. “That doesn’t always work. ” The anxiety, said Mr. Bishop, 46, a former deputy county sheriff who voted for Mr. Trump, centers not so much on politics as economics, specifically the intense competition with the French airplane maker Airbus, which competes toe to toe with Boeing for jet orders in countries around the world in a delicate game of narrow cost differences and giant contracts. Mr. Trump has said he would seek a 45 percent tariff on imports from China, for example, to protect American jobs, and a 20 percent tariff on goods from Mexico. If business costs for Boeing go up as a result, the company  —   the nation’s single largest exporter by dollar volume  —   probably would not be able to raise prices on its airplanes to make up the difference, because then it would lose customers to Airbus. For workers and suppliers, the fallout could be brutal. “So what does it mean? It means they may cut jobs,” said Kevin Michaels, the managing director at AeroDynamic Advisory, a specialized market analysis company in Ann Arbor, Mich. “It’s a very complex field. ” And one that is already changing. Boeing’s commercial airplane division cut 8 percent of its work force, or over 6, 000 jobs, in the United States last year. Some companies in the supply chain, partly because of   pressure by Boeing, have shrunk or merged. Since his election, Mr. Trump has tried to pit American aviation companies against one another over the costs of new fighter jets, and has harshly criticized Boeing’s high price tag for a new Air Force One presidential plane. Boeing, founded in Seattle in 1916, employs about 140, 000 people in the United States, about half of them in Washington State. “We’ve got such a huge network here  —   anything that curtails exports hurts the entire supply chain,” said John Thornquist, the director of the aerospace office at the Washington State Department of Commerce. “We’re very vulnerable. ” Companies that sell to Boeing, or sell to other companies that build Boeing components, said that even predicting a trade war was risky, with so many variables  —   politics, economics, multiple countries  —   all in play. A modern commercial jetliner can have up to six million components that must be engineered and tested to safety standards, even before assembly starts. “We’re trying to do our best due diligence to put together an assessment, but at this time, the best we can do is just monitor day by day,” said Maurizio Miozza, the vice president for development and strategic planning at Umbra Cuscinetti, an Italian company that makes precision parts for Boeing and that has about 100 employees north of Seattle. But, he added, “the picture is not rosy. ” “You prepare yourself for the worst and hope for the best,” he said. Other aerospace companies were hesitant to discuss their worries because it might draw unwanted attention  —   from competitors, the White House or foreign governments. It is not a good time, several said, to take chances. Boeing declined an interview request for this article, but said in an email statement that talks with the Trump administration were continuing. “The administration has made it clear that they are   growth, including in exports and manufacturing jobs,” the company said. “We are engaged with the administration in direct and productive discussion. ” In any small business, optimism and practicality are lifeblood forces, and SmartCells’ president, Bryce L. Betteridge, a chemical engineer, says he believes the company’s future is bright. A   mix of polymers and wafflelike molds creates the upward bounce of a SmartCells mat, which reduces fatigue for a standing person and can also prevent injuries in falls, he said. The company has already diversified. Amazon warehouse workers and Costco checkout clerks  —   both employed by companies that started out in the Seattle area  —   stand on SmartCells mats. And Mr. Betteridge mentioned other new markets and ideas with enthusiasm: rifle stocks, nursing home floors, playgrounds. No idea for a better cushion seems beyond reach. But he said the company’s strategy for the future was shifting on the assumption that international trade under Mr. Trump would become more difficult. For one thing, he said, he has now discarded any thought of expanding the company into China, Mexico or anywhere else where SmartCells’ products could be made and brought into the United States for sale. “That benefit is going to go away, I anticipate,” Mr. Betteridge said. And it is simply too expensive to export heavy, relatively   products like cushion mats to other countries from Washington, he said. That means the company’s growth in foreign markets, when or if it happens, will probably come through licensing the technology to manufacturers abroad, which will then hire local workers. Sales and marketing positions might be added here in Chehalis, Mr. Betteridge said, but no added manufacturing jobs would be needed. But a pressure to “buy American” coming from the White House could also be a powerful force, he and other industry leaders said, if companies like Boeing ultimately shift a greater proportion of their airplane component purchases to suppliers in the United States. Currently, Boeing spends about 80 percent of its $40 billion annual   budget in the United States, and exports about 75 percent of its products. “Some of the suppliers in Puget Sound might actually be rooting for this, because in the long run it could benefit them,” Mr. Michaels, the industry analyst, said. Kurt Mullins, 56, a former lumber millworker who has been at SmartCells for about a year and a half, often installs floor cushioning systems at Boeing, where he hears the worries of workers there, too. “I think it’s going to get worse before it gets better,” Mr. Mullins said.	1
180	Read in Chinese   点击查看本文中文版] Despite promises to cut steel overcapacity, China actually brought more steel production online last year, resulting in a surge in air pollution in northern China, especially around Beijing, according to a report released this week by Greenpeace East Asia. The growth in operating capacity was more than twice the total steel making capacity of Britain, the report said. The increase in steel production, which is powered by the burning of coal, also means that levels of greenhouse gas emissions from that sector almost certainly grew last year, compared with 2015 levels. Greenhouse gases are the main factor behind the acceleration of climate change. The steel industry is the second biggest emitter of carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas the first is power generation, which also relies mostly on coal. China is the biggest greenhouse gas emitter in the world, ahead of the United States. The report, released Monday, shows how powerful   enterprises and local officials have acted to keep steel companies operating out of economic   despite a serious overcapacity problem in the industry. And as China’s economic growth slows, local governments feel rising pressure to support factory jobs to avoid domestic unrest. The report said 10 Chinese provinces increased their operating steel production capacity. The greatest increases were in Shanxi and Hebei, which are close to Beijing and have some of the most toxic air in the world. Only six provinces had a net decrease, the report said. The Chinese consulting firm Custeel, under commission from Greenpeace East Asia, did the main research for the report. The firm based its calculations on surveys and official documents, including ones from local governments. Growth in steel demand across China has been slowing since 2011, leading to pledges by officials to cut capacity. Officials said that efforts last year to cut capacity had exceeded targets set for the year. But the research by Custeel showed that officials pulled a sleight of hand in making that declaration  —   many of the cuts were to plants that had already been idle. As a result, only 23 million metric tons of capacity was actually closed, the report said. Those closures curtailed supply at the same time that government stimulus led to a   uptick in demand. Officials and companies restarted some plants that had previously been suspended, the report said. That production capacity was equal to 49 million metric tons, about the same as Germany’s total steel making capacity. China also added 12 million metric tons of new capacity. As a result, the net increase in operating steel capacity for 2016 was 36. 5 million metric tons, the report said. Eighty percent of that increase came from just three provinces: Hebei, Shanxi and Tianjin. Some government policies have gone against the stated goal of cutting overcapacity. From 2013 to 2015, bank lending and government subsidies to the steel industry increased. In 2016, stimulus policies “created a miniboom in construction, artificially inflating steel demand and steel prices. ” The report said most of the capacity that was cut came from closures of plants that were privately owned or owned by central state enterprises, which suggested that local   enterprises and governments were protecting their own interests. A Greenpeace analysis of Beijing air quality data showed that steady progress in curbing air pollution in Beijing stalled last year. In some months late in the year, air quality worsened over 2015. In the first five weeks of 2017, the concentration of PM2. 5, or particulate matter of a size deemed especially harmful, was almost twice as much as the same period in 2016. In 2013, the central government announced goals to cut coal use in three major population centers in China, including in the large region around Beijing, to try to bring down levels of air pollution, among the worst in the world. Stimulus policies last year also led to an increase in coal prices during one period, though climate change researchers say they expect data to show that overall coal consumption in China declined in 2016 compared with 2015.	1
103	WASHINGTON  —   Russian military officials have vociferously denied that their airstrikes have killed civilians in Syria, going so far as to say that eyewitness accounts that a major hospital was bombed last year in the brutal fight to retake Aleppo were mere fabrications. But a new analysis that draws on satellite images, security camera videos, social media and even footage from the   Russian television network has challenged Moscow’s claims that its airstrikes on behalf of the Syrian military were an exercise in prudent restraint. The analysis shows that the hospital, contrary to claims by a Russian general, was bombed multiple times. It indicates that Russian aircraft used incendiary munitions and cluster bombs, despite the Kremlin’s denials, and concludes that Syrian forces used chlorine gas on a far greater scale than is commonly believed. The analysis is presented in a report, “Breaking Aleppo,” which is to be made public on Monday by the Atlantic Council, a   policy research center. The report comes as President Trump has signaled an interest in forging better connections with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, which could include working more closely with the Russian military in Syria. “Throughout the entire length of the battle for Aleppo, there have been multiple claims of violations of human rights and multiple denials,” said Eliot Higgins, a senior fellow at the Digital Forensic Research Lab of the Atlantic Council. “What we have been able to present now is a wealth of evidence confirming the targeting of civilian structures, namely hospitals, which in certain cases has been denied by the Russian Ministry of Defense,” he added. “We have been able to confirm the use in civilian areas of a variety of indiscriminate weapons. ” Syrian forces, backed by Hezbollah fighters, Iran’s paramilitary Quds Force and Russian air power, took Aleppo in late December. The capture of the city was an important milestone that gave the government of President Bashar   control over all of Syria’s major cities and strengthened Moscow’s hand in discussions over the country’s future. But while the Atlantic Council report acknowledges that his victory in Aleppo has solidified Mr. Assad’s hold on power, at least for now, it argues that the ruthless strategy and tactics used by the Syrian and Russian governments would make the Syrian president “a poor if not harmful partner” in efforts to defeat the Islamic State and other extremist groups. Experts at the Atlantic Council have long urged the United States to do more to protect civilians in Syria and support the moderate opposition. In the report, the group employs hard evidence, including satellite images from DigitalGlobe, a commercial satellite company, fresh accounts from Syrian activists on the ground and photography published by Russia’s Defense Ministry. Much of the analysis of the photos and social media was done by Mr. Higgins, a   researcher who founded the investigative website bellingcat. com. A reconstruction of one key episode  —   the July 16 bombing of another hospital, known as M2, in the Maadi district  —   was carried out by Forensic Architecture, a research organization at Goldsmiths, University of London, which was asked to take an independent look at the video and photographic evidence of the bombing. Aleppo was divided in July 2012 between   and   areas. With the support of Russia, the Assad government began a major offensive in September of last year to take the city. Fragile and temporary   were used by the Syrians and their allies to prepare fresh offensives, which, despite Russian and Syrian denials, often targeted civilian areas. One claim that the Atlantic Council report challenges was issued by Lt. Gen. Sergei F. Rudskoi, the head of the operations directorate of the Russian general staff, who insisted in October that no damage had been done to the   hospital in a Russian bombing raid. To buttress his case, General Rudskoi displayed satellite photos that he said had been taken between Sept. 24 and Oct. 11. Eyewitness accounts to the contrary, he added, were “mere fakes. ” But a comparison of DigitalGlobe satellite photos taken on Sept. 25 and Oct. 13, the Atlantic Council report notes, shows the emergence of a large bomb crater near the hospital, also known as M10, and damage to the hospital building. Security camera videos from inside the hospital offer corroborating evidence of an Oct. 3 attack, as does a photo from the street by a local resident. The report concludes that there were several reasons to think the attacks on the medical centers were deliberate, including the large number of strikes, the Assad government’s knowledge of the terrain, and the Syrian government’s practice of confiscating medical supplies from humanitarian aid convoys. The M2 hospital was damaged by air and artillery strikes at least a dozen times between June and December. Other photographic evidence points to the use of incendiary munitions and cluster bombs. The   television channel, Russia Today, provided some of the evidence in video footage it showed in June that had been taken at a Russian air base near Latakia, Syria. (The version of the report that was later uploaded to YouTube deleted the images of the weapons being mounted on a Russian warplane.) When a Russian team later entered eastern Aleppo to clear away unexploded ordnance, a photograph published by the Russian Defense Ministry showed the remains of cluster bombs, the Atlantic Council report notes. A variety of reports from victims and video on YouTube indicate that Syrian government attacks with chlorine gas increased in the final phase of the battle for Aleppo. One video “showed a chlorine gas cylinder with its labels intact,” the report said. The use of chlorine bombs by the Syrian government, Mr. Higgins said, continued even after reports confirming their use were made by the United Nations and an international watchdog organization in The Hague that enforces the ban on the use of chemical agents in war.	1
339	Nikki Haskell has packed many lives into her 75 years. She has been a real estate broker, a party planner, a pioneering stockbroker, a cult   host, a Studio 54 regular, a diet and fitness guru, and a socialite. Through it all, she has depended on her brains, her enthusiasm and her skill as a social connector to power her through the tough times. But now she is facing what may be the most difficult challenge of her life: maintaining her position in the social hierarchies of liberal New York and Los Angeles while serving as a cheerleader for one of her oldest friends, Donald J. Trump, whom she first encountered in 1974 at Le Club, a defunct   nightspot on East 55th Street in Manhattan. Ms. Haskell said she had a wonderful time at the     dinner held for Mr. Trump at Union Station in Washington on Jan. 19. But over the weekend, in a   suite at the Mandarin Oriental, she seemed to be wavering a little. Glued to the television on the morning of Jan. 22, she watched the coverage of the women’s marches in various cities across the country, as well as footage from the more raucous demonstrations of Jan. 20, during which protesters smashed windows, set a limousine on fire and clashed with the police not far from the Mandarin Oriental. After watching this stuff all day on many different channels, Ms. Haskell thought an uprising might be underway. “You see what’s going on in the streets, all these people rioting, all these women?” she said in a phone conversation. “Nothing ever happened like this. They never had these riots  —   every street, every city, all across the world. When there’s crowds and craziness like this, you never know what’ll happen. It’s horrifying. ” Given what she was seeing on television and in her social media feeds, she was worried that her vocal support for the new president would make her a pariah. “I can’t be the only person in the whole world defending Donald Trump,” she said. “I’ll be walking down the street, they’ll attack me. I don’t want to be attacked. This is totally out of control. I’m afraid to walk down the streets in New York or L. A. I’m trying to get a television show on the air, which will never happen in this environment. I’ll never have another friend. Nobody’s going to speak to me. ” When Ms. Haskell was a girl growing up on Lake Shore Drive in Chicago, her father bought her six horses, and she wore custom riding suits, with white wing collars and high silk hats, in shows across the Midwest. At night, her parents took her to the Chicago nightclub Chez Paris, where she became besotted with show business while taking in performances by Milton Berle, Jimmy Durante, Carmen Miranda and Mae West. Not long after the family moved to Beverly Hills, Calif. when Ms. Haskell was 13, her father died of a heart attack and her mother went to work. Ms. Haskell soldiered on. At Beverly Hills High School, she was head cheerleader and was voted “Biggest Flirt” in her senior year. In the Los Angeles of the 1960s, she won a twist contest judged by Bob Hope and Joan Collins. She dated Tony Bennett and hung out with Frankie Avalon, Fabian and George Hamilton. She married a real estate developer, Jack Haskell. After divorcing him, she said, she parlayed the $18, 000 settlement into a small fortune on the stock market. She remarried Mr. Haskell in 1966, moved with him to 470 Park Avenue in New York and divorced him again in 1968. She got her apartment in Manhattan, took classes in investing and was hired at Burnham and Company (which would later become Drexel Burnham). For 10 years, she was a stockbroker by day (and one of the few women working on Wall Street) and a constant presence at Manhattan restaurants and clubs by night. She was equally at ease dining at Elaine’s or judging a Blueboy magazine beauty pageant in the meatpacking district. She joked that she lived at Studio 54. She made friends with Rick James, Imelda Marcos, Andy Warhol and the Village People. She hit her stride with “The Nikki Haskell Show,” a charmingly   program on the New York   stations Channel J and Channel 10. In the 1980s, she was the forerunner of a YouTube star, and her guests included Michael Caine, Divine, Timothy Leary, Sophia Loren, Diana Ross, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Peter Sellers and Peter Ustinov. And Mr. Trump. New York magazine called her the “Queen of Comp” for her habit of scoring freebies in exchange for positive publicity. Spy magazine, less charmed by her social climbing, likened her to Pia Zadora. In the past three decades, she has been a staple at parties and benefits. She has also remade herself as an entrepreneur in the diet and fitness industry as the creator of StarCaps diet pills, which got her in trouble with federal authorities in 2014, because its supposedly “natural” ingredients included the drug bumetanide. Ms. Haskell was fined $60, 000, The Daily News reported. (Ms. Haskell put the figure at $70, 000.) She also sells the Star Cruncher, a piece of exercise equipment, through Groupon  —   “a gym in a bag,” she calls it. A longtime Democrat, she faced a dilemma last year when Mr. Trump’s campaign for the Republican presidential nomination began to take off. “I’m sort of in a quandary,” she said in her Upper East Side apartment last April, “because nothing would make me happier in the whole world than to see Hillary Clinton as president. I never thought that in my lifetime we would have a woman president, and I’ve always been very supportive of the Clintons. I’m a registered Democrat, but I vote across party lines and would never have voted for anyone else except for Hillary, if it wasn’t for the fact that Donald’s running. ” One reason she was leaning toward Mr. Trump was her belief that people were not ready for a female president. “The way things are throughout the world, men just don’t respect women enough,” Ms. Haskell said. “At this time a president being a woman might be detrimental. I hate to say that, but we live in a very, very antiwoman society. ” In September, Ms. Haskell came out as a public Trump supporter when she was interviewed for a Politico Magazine article headlined “The Real Trumpettes of Bel Air,” in which she said of Mrs. Clinton’s aide Huma Abedin, “I don’t think we should have a Muslim in power, someone working for the president. ” After it appeared, Ms. Haskell noticed a change in her social position on both coasts. “That’s when it all started,” she said. “It was a disaster. ” On election night, she went to a dinner in New York hosted by an entertainment mogul and was the only person there who admitted to voting for Mr. Trump, she said. Around 3 a. m. Ms. Haskell logged on to Facebook and posted: “How great, America wins. We love President Donald J. Trump. ” “You must be senile,” one of her followers replied. “U ought to be ashamed,” another wrote. On Nov. 10, she made a selfie video in the back of a New York City taxi and posted it on Facebook. “It’s up to us to do our part to make America great,” she said. “Whether you like Donald Trump or not, now is the time to become a better America. ” Before signing off with her customary goodbye (“ ! ”) she reminded everyone to watch her old public access shows  —   now available on Amazon Prime  —   a few of which showed her interviewing Mr. Trump when he was a mogul on the rise. Friends distanced themselves from Ms. Haskell, she said, and one bestie dropped her after 25 years of friendship. “I was actually in tears when someone told me they didn’t want to be my friend anymore because I supported Donald Trump,” she said. But Ms. Haskell refused to stop cheerleading. She made another video of herself while riding in a car down Park Avenue during the time of the frequent demonstrations near Trump Tower and the Trump International Hotel and Tower on Columbus Circle. After expressing frustration with the marches and protests (“stupid,” she called them) she said into her iPhone: “Donald Trump is not going away, and people are going to have to smack their kids around and sit them down and tell them to stop acting like jerks. And to be Americans and get with the program. See you later.  !” In December, the writer Kevin Sessums was fed up with her   posts on Facebook. The last straw was Ms. Haskell’s posting her 1982 public access interview with Roy Cohn, the mentor to Mr. Trump who served as Senator Joseph McCarthy’s counsel during the   hearings in 1954. “As if that were a glamorous, wonderful bit of footage,” Mr. Sessums posted. A later thread taking aim at Ms. Haskell grew to more than 100 comments. Over the holidays, she visited the California home of the movie producer Robert Evans, who wrote about Ms. Haskell in his 2013 memoir, “The Fat Lady Sang. ” He said he had no sympathy for those who have dropped her because of her support for the president. “I love her for it,” Mr. Evans said. “By losing Nikki’s friendship, they’re the losers. But she is a winner. ” On the afternoon of Jan. 19 at the Mandarin Oriental suite, which she was sharing with her friend, the   and philanthropist Kelly Day, Ms. Haskell started getting ready for the   dinner at Union Station for Mr. Trump’s donors and family members. “Donald always had big ideas, big dreams, and I was always fascinated with that,” she said while doing her eyelashes. She recalled first seeing him at Le Club. “He was really handsome, a hot guy, and he caught my eye immediately,” she said. “He was very captivating, even in a discothèque at night. ” Several months later, Mr. Cohn invited her to dinner at “21” and seated her next to Mr. Trump. “We clicked right away,” she said. The first night he took a Czech fashion model named Ivana Zelnickova out on the town, Ms. Haskell, along with her date, met up with them at Elaine’s. “Ivana and I became friends like that,” she said. “And when Studio 54 opened in 1977, I went with Donald and Ivana. ” As Ms Haskell and Ms. Day left the suite, Ms. Haskell spoke of her increasing number of  . “It takes a lot to make me cry,” she said, putting on a golden sable coat. “I have no children. I have a fabulous brother, nieces and nephews, but I’m a woman alone of 75 years old, and I find it just so disheartening. ” At Union Station, once through the metal detectors, Ms. Haskell smiled for the paparazzi. Her table was next to those occupied by Trump family members. After a speech by the   Ms. Haskell chatted a while with Melania, Ivanka and Tiffany Trump. “I can’t believe we’re here,” Tiffany told her. As waiters cleared away the main course (roasted branzino) she got up. “I supported Donald when no one supported him,” Ms. Haskell said on her way to the powder room. “One of the family just said to me, ‘It wouldn’t have happened if it wasn’t for you.’ Well, I don’t know if that’s necessarily true. But I really believe in Donald. ” She walked by Jose Fanjul, the sugar baron, and Christine Hearst Schwarzman, the wife of the billionaire Stephen A. Schwarzman. “You know why it’s a great party?” Ms. Haskell said. “Because everybody here loves Donald. ” After dessert (vanilla meringue cake) she seemed to feel better about those   of hers. “They’ll get over it,” she said. “If they don’t, they don’t. ” A protester was scowling at guests leaving the party. “He makes America ashamed!” the woman said. Waiting for an Uber, Ms. Haskell rhapsodized about the spectacular crystal, the silverware, the gold charger plates, the tablecloths, the decorations. At the lobby bar of the Mandarin Oriental, she ordered a Grey Goose orange vodka with club soda and a slice of orange (a “ ”) and said she hadn’t been offended by any of the remarks made by Mr. Trump, even those captured on the   Billy Bush tape. “Listen, Donald has more respect for women than anyone I know,” she said. “I’m not saying he’s not a guy. Guys talk about girls. They talk about getting them into bed. But it’s just guy talk. ” She remembered the interviews she did with him. “And now they’re all on Amazon Prime,” she said. “The history of what I’ve done will live on forever. ” Back in the suite, Ms. Haskell and Ms. Day ordered room service and didn’t call it quits until around 4:30 a. m. Later, they watched the inauguration together in their bathrobes. On Sunday, while watching the women’s protests on television, Ms. Haskell said she might ease up on the cheerleading until things settled down. “I’m just one little person,” she said. “I’m not Kellyanne Conway. ” She got dressed and made it to Reagan National Airport. “I’m never going to march,” she said on the phone, after clearing through security. “Yes, it worked in the Vietnam War and things like that, but that was a different time. I would have no problem going to Congress, and because I have this close friendship with the Trump family, I will use this opportunity to better all the things for women. Because that’s exactly how I feel. ” While still counting herself a Trump supporter, Ms. Haskell has indeed eased up with the Facebook posts in favor of the president since the inauguration weekend. “You know, I’m running out of friends and I got tired of all the negativity,” she said on Wednesday. “People were busting my chops and I lost a couple of very close friends, which I think is actually quite insane and pathetic, to think that people who are these lifelong friends are not speaking to me because I voted for Donald Trump. ” But lately she has taken pains to post nonincendiary material. “Just to show you how things have changed,” Ms. Haskell said, “the other day I posted myself going to the grocery store. That was a first. ”	1
347	MALMO, Sweden  —   It has been only three years since she came to Sweden from Syria, but Hiba Abou Alhassane already says “we” when speaking about her new home country. “Did we, I mean did Sweden, take too many refugees? Should we close the border?” she pondered this week after President Trump’s remarks that Sweden’s immigration policies had failed. “It already happened. People aren’t coming anymore. ” In many ways, Ms. Alhassane is a perfect example of Sweden’s   belief in the rightness of sheltering and helping to support migrants and refugees. She has worked hard to integrate. Already nearly fluent in Swedish, she teaches at two local primary schools. But recently Swedes also find themselves questioning the wisdom of their generosity to outsiders in need, and its potential limits, leading to the country’s harshest debate ever over immigration. Some residents see the clash as a refreshing chance to voice   concerns over immigration and its effects. Others see it as both racist and redundant, since Sweden is already changing its immigration policies. Swedes are not rushing to a     approach to immigration, nor are they ready to throw out their country’s humanitarian values when it comes to sheltering refugees, values that remain firmly rooted in the national psyche. Until a year and a half ago, Sweden offered lifetime protection, along with family reunification, to people deemed legitimate refugees. In 2015, about 163, 000 people came and sought that protection, and the sheer numbers led this country of roughly 10 million to tighten the rules. Protection is now subject to review after one or three years and family reunification is more difficult, making Sweden less accessible and less attractive to immigrants. “Sweden has been a top recipient of asylum seekers per capita in Europe, priding itself on a humanitarian approach to immigration,” said Daniel Schatz, a visiting scholar at Columbia University’s European Institute. “During the Iraq war, Sodertalje, a small Swedish municipality, took more Iraqi refugees than the U. S. and U. K. combined. ” “Sweden is experiencing a clash of ideals,” he added. “While the country seeks to maintain a humanitarian ideal, public concerns around immigration have begun to shift the politics of traditionally liberal Sweden to tighter immigration controls and more restrictive policies. The debate on migration is thus a very personal one for many Swedes. ” Mr. Trump is not the only person pointing to what he considers to be the troubling consequences of immigration to Sweden. This month, a seasoned investigator with the police department in Orebro, Peter Springare, caused a stir with a Facebook posting in which he discussed the case files on his desk. “What I’ve been handling   this week: Rape, rape, serious rape, assault rape, black mail, black mail, assault in court, threats, attack against police, threats against police, drugs, serious drugs, attempted murder, rape again, black mail again and abuse,” Mr. Springare said. He went on to list the first names of the people he said were suspects, all but one of which were traditionally Middle Eastern. The post, which was shared 20, 500 times, led to an outpouring of support. People sent hundreds of flowers to Mr. Springare’s police station, and more than 170, 000 people joined a Facebook group supporting him. But both his superiors and the police in other departments said that they did not recognize his description, and that national levels did not resemble his claims. Manne Gerell, a lecturer in criminology with Malmo University, said more immigrants than Swedes commit crimes, but the exact numbers are hard to determine. And on the national level, he said, the imbalance is not nearly as great as Mr. Springare suggested. Still, it seems as if frustrations over the issue are spreading. In 2014, the   Sweden Democrats gained 12. 9 percent of the vote in parliamentary elections to become the country’s   party, up from only 2. 9 percent eight years earlier. “Shunned by mainstream parties, their stance is increasingly resonating with some voters,” Mr. Schatz said. Some of the party’s progress has to do with residents’ perceptions of crime, a significant issue here in Malmo, Sweden’s   city with about 350, 000 people, which is often called the “Chicago of the Nordic region. ” The reference is not to its icy, windswept shores. The murder rate in Malmo is the highest among Scandinavian countries: 3. 4 annually per 100, 000 citizens, compared with 1. 3 in Stockholm, the capital. That has earned Malmo an unsavory reputation well beyond Sweden’s borders, but the assessment lacks context: Chicago’s homicide rate was 28 per 100, 000 citizens last year, and Saint Louis’s was 59, according to one analysis. A murder in Malmo remains so rare that it still generates headlines nationwide. More than 40 percent of the city’s residents or their parents are   a fact that is often linked to Malmo’s crime rates, but Mr. Gerell, the criminologist, said a correlation was not clear, and even if there was one, immigration was not the only contributing factor. “Immigration has most likely played a part in the crime rates,” he said. “But we have many, many poor people living in poor areas so it’s not only about immigration. That said, poverty doesn’t necessarily cause crime, but when there are lots of social problems there will be more of other problems. ” Even some longtime immigrants concede that integration has not always gone smoothly, and that Sweden needs a more robust debate about what has gone wrong and what could be done better. Maher Dabour, who came to Sweden from Lebanon in the 1980s, said the main problem lay in how migrants are schooled in societal differences. “They didn’t manage to explain to us how to be citizens,” he said. “In legal terms it’s not difficult, and they’ve been more than generous, but it’s not enough to give money. ” Thirty years after leaving Lebanon, Mr. Dabour drives a Volvo and instinctively buckles his seatbelt like a Swede, but he breaks with tradition and chain smokes. He said that Swedes had built a society based on the individual’s respect for the state, discipline and rules, but that many newly arrived people come with no respect for, or trust in, government authorities, but great regard for family and elders. “The authorities say everything is O. K. and in order, but it’s not true,” Mr. Dabour said. “We need to have an open and honest discussion about the problems,” he added, referring to crime among immigrants. In Malmo, the Rosengard district has for years been named by the national police as having a high crime rate, although that has improved recently. It is home to 25, 000 people, 86 percent of them with foreign backgrounds.   housing is clustered around a shopping center, where shops bear names like Noor, Najib and Orient Musik. “We try to not focus on the problems,” said Maria Roijer, the chief librarian at the public library. She tries to act as a bridge between the many nationalities of Rosengard and Swedish society. Ms. Roijer said many people of foreign origin come to the library and join the language cafe to practice their Swedish, to borrow books and use the computers. “They need them to be able to communicate with authorities,” she said. For decades area residents have felt they got more negative attention from the media than positive responses from municipal officials. “They built a nice waterfront and created 10, 000 jobs in the western part of town, but all we got was two mosques,” said Mira Dekanic, a retiree and nearby resident. But change is coming. Recently three new real estate companies bought apartment blocks here and one also acquired the shopping center. The companies say that while they must make a profit for their shareholders, they are also committed to the area’s social development so people who live in Rosengard will have jobs, better houses and more places to meet and things to do in their free time. “We’re aiming for the long term,” said Birgitta Bengtson, a representative of Trianon, one of the developers. If all goes well, more native Swedes and Swedish retailers may move to Rosengard. “HM and Espresso House is a dream,” she said. In a Turkish restaurant, a Syrian refugee, Mohammed Hoppe, was clearing tables and washing dishes. He said he had been too busy to keep up with Mr. Trump’s remarks about Sweden, but after three and a half years in the country, he hadn’t seen anything bad happen. And for her part, Ms. Alhassane, was not interested in the comments, either. “Honestly, everything coming from the U. S. these days is a kind of joke,” she said. “I wasn’t even curious to find out if what he said was true. I didn’t need to. ”	1

48	WASHINGTON  —   President Trump, who presented himself as a staunch supporter of Israel during last year’s campaign, took a harder line on settlements in an interview published on Friday and indicated that he was rethinking his promise to move the United States Embassy to Jerusalem. Mr. Trump told an Israeli newspaper that settlements “don’t help the process” and that he did not believe that “going forward with these settlements is a good thing for peace. ” He also did not reaffirm his past vow to move the embassy, saying that it “is not an easy decision” and “we will see what happens. ” The comments amounted to a striking recalibration of Mr. Trump’s approach to Israel just five days before Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is scheduled to visit the White House. Mr. Trump and Jared Kushner, his    and senior adviser, have been exploring an   peace initiative that would enlist Arab allies, and a host of Arab leaders have told the new president that provocative   positions would not help. The interview was conducted with Israel Hayom, the newspaper owned by Sheldon Adelson, the casino magnate and close ally of Mr. Netanyahu. Mr. Trump hosted Mr. Adelson and his wife for dinner at the White House on Thursday night, along with Mr. Kushner and Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson. The president’s language in the interview went beyond the carefully written statement issued by the White House last week saying that settlements were not an impediment to peace but they “may not be helpful. ” The statement was seen as a sign that Mr. Trump wanted Mr. Netanyahu to hold off contentious moves, at least until their meeting next week. Since Mr. Trump’s inauguration, Mr. Netanyahu’s government has announced the construction of 5, 500 new houses in the occupied West Bank, and the prime minister even raised the idea of building the first entirely new settlement in years. Mr. Netanyahu’s coalition pushed through Parliament a new bill retroactively authorizing thousands of houses built on   land that are illegal even under Israeli law. “They don’t help the process,” Mr. Trump said of settlements in the Israel Hayom interview. “I can say that. There is so much land left. And every time you take land for settlements, there is less land left. ” He added: “I am not somebody that believes that going forward with these settlements is a good thing for peace. ” Mr. Trump’s statement on the embassy move was also strikingly different than past comments. Arab leaders have warned him that moving the embassy to Jerusalem, which both Israelis and Palestinians claim, would lead to angry and possibly violent reactions because it would be seen as prejudging a final settlement between the two sides. The last three presidents refused to move the embassy there for that very reason. Last year, Mr. Trump said he would move the embassy “fairly quickly” after taking office. When approached by Boaz Bismuth of Israel Hayom on the eve of his inauguration last month, he reiterated his commitment by saying, “You know I’m not a person who breaks promises. ” But when Mr. Bismuth asked about it on Thursday, Mr. Trump did not repeat his vow. Instead, he said he was studying it. “The embassy is not an easy decision,” Mr. Trump said. “It has obviously been out there for many, many years and nobody has wanted to make that decision. I’m thinking about it very seriously and we will see what happens. ” Mr. Trump, who last year blistered his predecessor, President Barack Obama, for not being supportive enough of Israel, said he would not publicly criticize it. “I don’t want to condemn Israel,” he said. “Israel has had a long history of condemnation and difficulty. And I don’t want to be condemning Israel. ” But he also said he wanted Israel to compromise to make peace. “I want Israel to be reasonable with respect to peace,” he said. Mr. Trump did not offer support for a   solution, which has been American policy for years. However, he held out the prospect of a regional agreement. “Maybe there is even a chance for a bigger peace than just Israel and the Palestinians,” he said. “I would like to see a level of reasonableness of both parties and I think we have a good chance of doing that. ”	1
495	Lyft, the   ride hailing company in the United States, is trying to raise more money just as Uber, its bigger rival, grapples with questions about its culture and leadership. Lyft is talking with investors about new   that would put the company’s value around $6 billion, according to three people briefed on the financing who asked to remain anonymous because the proceedings are confidential. One of the people said the valuation could be as high as $7 billion. The company was  valued at $5. 5 billion early last year after investors, including General Motors, poured about $1 billion into it. It is unclear how far along Lyft is with the new   and whether the round will be completed. Lyft, which is based in San Francisco, declined to comment. The funding effort was earlier reported by The Wall Street Journal. The   may bolster Lyft competitively, given that Uber has been caught up in an escalating series of internal problems. Travis Kalanick, Uber’s chief executive, has been under scrutiny this year for his participation in an economic advisory council for President Trump amid a social media campaign for people to delete their Uber app. Mr. Kalanick eventually stepped down from the council. Uber has also wrestled with concerns about its workplace culture over the past few weeks, after a former employee published an account of her year at the company, which included allegations of sexual harassment and discrimination. In addition, Uber was caught misleading journalists about an accident caused by one of its   cars. And Waymo, the   car business spun out of Google’s parent company, Alphabet, sued Uber last week, claiming it had used technology stolen by one of its employees. This week, Mr. Kalanick apologized for his behavior toward an Uber driver after a video of him losing his temper with the driver surfaced. Lyft has long been the underdog to Uber. Lyft operates only in the United States while Uber is a global company. The two have previously engaged in pricing wars and have   each other. In August, Lyft held discussions with General Motors, Apple, Google, Amazon, Uber and Didi Chuxing about selling itself. The company could not agree with potential buyers on a price. Yet Lyft’s brand has recently looked comparatively attractive. As Uber struggled with its ties to President Trump’s administration in January, Lyft donated $1 million to the American Civil Liberties Union. Lyft’s app subsequently soared to the top of the Apple app store’s download list. Neither Lyft nor Uber has emerged as a financially sound business. Their battle has led them to lower prices and offer deals to lure new customers and maintain their market share. It has been hard for either company to raise prices enough to cover costs. Both Lyft and Uber are still unprofitable and depend on private investment capital to fund their operations.	1
852	  On the heels of the Confederate flag controversy, the City Council of Harrisburg voted to permanently close the doors of the Civil War Museum last week.This decision resulted in hiring a small workforce tasked with packing the delicate artifacts that have been held inside its walls for decades. The new temporary hires, however, were infiltrated by a group of activists disguised as workers, who took it upon themselves to destroy what they called “shrines to racism, bigotry, and hate.” Without authorization, nor the real work crew’s knowledge, they collected various Confederate artifacts and burned them behind the building, out of sight of the museum staff.Some of the destroyed historical artifacts were original confederate uniforms, rifles, equipment, flags, and swords. After the anti-Confederate activists burned all of the items they were able to carry outside quickly, they walked away, abandoning the site and leaving a smoldering pile of ashes with the remains of swords, muskets, and metal buttons for horrified museum staff to discover. It has come to our attention that someone has placed a story on the internet which purports that this museum is closed and that Confederate items and/or artifacts have been destroyed here. Rest assured everyone, the story is completely false. All is well here and our historical items are safe and sound.	0
308	Shopping for consumer electronics can get overwhelming. The staff of The Wirecutter and The Sweethome, product review websites owned by The New York Times, do the hard work of narrowing down the options. We spoke with Lauren Dragan, the headphone editor, about  —   what else?  —   headphones.  There are so many choices for earphones and earbuds. How do I decide what to buy? It’s tough! There really isn’t any one headphone that works for all situations, so sometimes the best option is having two less expensive headphones that are suited to your lifestyle and listening habits. If you know how you’ll use them, you can better figure out what features will be important. What do you use? Because of my job, I get to know the perfect headphone for every situation. I think I regularly rotate among seven pairs. I have a Plantronics Backbeat Fit for running  —   they’re unsealed so I can hear traffic and my surroundings  —   an Oppo   for longer listening sessions, a   Bose QC25 for flying (and vacuuming) a Plantronics Voyager Focus UC headset for business calls, a   JLab Epic 2 Bluetooth for the gym, my custom   UE 11 for when I’m trying to get work done at a coffee shop, and then I rotate in whatever I’m currently   testing. I always spend a week using any potential top pick before we post a review so I can troubleshoot. I’ve caught a few problems that way. And yes, I’ve even done that with the kids’ headphones. I have a surprisingly small hat size. Why aren’t the new Apple cordless earbuds on the list? Ah, the AirPods. The current working term for those kinds of headphones is “true wireless. ” Aside from not having a cord to tangle and being decent at taking phone calls, the AirPods didn’t improve much over the corded EarPods. The sound quality is the same (which is to say, meh, with no bass). Plus the battery life is less than a full day at work, so you had better remember to charge them at lunch time. And this for $130 more than a replacement pair of EarPods? I don’t think they’re fully cooked yet. Do headphones and earbuds really have to cost so much? Some technology, like a Bluetooth antenna or an active   circuit, is going to cost a manufacturer a certain amount for the components and licensing fees. A manufacturer can’t get them into a product for any less. That sets a base manufacturing cost. So a good pair of   sport Bluetooth headphones, a solid product that will last you a few years, costs about $99. Anything below that will likely suffer in some way. To some people, that’s O. K. But you can’t expect magic for $30. On the other end, when you’re paying over $300, you are getting a combination of innovation, product quality and sound quality. But a lot of times, anything much above that, it’s just plain old marketing and hype. Are you thinking of any particular headphones? In the audio quality category, there’s the planar magnetic Oppo, Audeze, Mr. Speakers, brands like that. They range from $400 and up. Bose has the best    technology available, and it’s because the company spent a ton of money on research and development. And of course, Beats has the market cornered on branding. They’ve been making a lot of improvements to their sound quality. But the difference between them and others priced that high is that you’re paying $150 to $200 for sound and adding on another $100 or so for the Beats label. What’s your dream product? There’s the elusive unicorn: headphones that do everything well and work in any situation. That could be possible with what’s available to purchase today, but nobody has made it just yet. But I’m also really fascinated with where companies like Bragi and Here One are going with “hearables. ” Those are devices that are computers worn in your ears  —   like what Google Glass was trying to do with vision, but in your ears instead.	1
94	“So should I cash out of the stock market?” This is the question I’ve heard from several   friends in the last few months. I get a few emails in this vein every time the stock market hits new highs, as it did on Friday. They are worried that the combination of high share prices and an erratic president mean that the only direction for stocks is down. They are considering shifting some of their assets into cash or bonds. The short and safe answer to give them is: “I don’t know. ” But there’s also a long answer. Letting one’s political opinions shape investing decisions is a good way to lose money. Whether a given chunk of your savings should be in stocks, bonds or cash depends on your appetite for risk and when you’re going to need that money. It shouldn’t be shaped by whether you love or hate the current occupant of the White House. We all have a tendency to fall for motivated reasoning. If you think President Trump and his policies are bad, there’s a natural tendency to think that this will soon be reflected in share prices. That could turn out to be true. But politics makes us stupid. It can cause us to overweight the risks and perils we want to see, and underweight the possibility that, at least in terms of markets, things could go quite well. First, much of the movement in stocks has little to do with what the president of the United States does. It would be silly to credit Bill Clinton with the   boom that took place during his presidency, or to blame George W. Bush for the collapse of it. But even when the action in Washington is driving markets, it is easy to be blinded by your political opinions. The response to the financial crisis by the Obama administration and the Federal Reserve in early 2009 succeeded at ending the recession and setting the United States economy on an expansion that continues to this day. Conservatives tended to malign the stock market rally every step of the way. But those who put their money where their mouth was  —   that is, into cash instead of stocks  —   lost out on a 182 percent gain in the Standard  Poor’s 500 during the Obama presidency. Liberals are just as susceptible to this motivated reasoning. Barry Ritholtz of Ritholtz Wealth Management recalls hearing   friends in the hedge fund industry confidently assert in 2003 that the Bush tax cuts would be bad for markets by blowing out the budget deficit and failing to create jobs. Instead, the stock market rose steadily from that point until late 2007. There’s certainly no guarantee that the stock market will continue to rise under the Trump administration. There are ways that the outlook for investors could get better, and also plenty of ways for them to get worse. It’s very likely there will be corporate tax cuts and deregulation, both of which benefit companies’ bottom lines in a pretty direct and measurable way. It is optimism about those policy priorities that has driven the market rally since Election Day. Throw in some extra government spending on the military and public infrastructure, and you have a recipe for speedier growth. Maybe the pragmatic,   figures in the Trump administration will prevail in internal battles, meaning that, whatever you think of the broader policy agenda, there could be boom times for corporate bottom lines. There are, of course, darker possibilities. President Trump could spark a trade war that could turn into a global recession. Military conflict could break out with a major trading partner like China or could disrupt oil supplies in the Middle East. And a small crisis could spiral into something bigger because of Mr. Trump’s     management style. Whatever probability you assign to positive and negative outcomes, it’s hard to dispute that the range of possibilities for what the global economy will look like in four years is uncommonly large. All else being equal, more variation in the economic future means that stocks are riskier. It’s also true that by many measures stock valuations are high. Investing $100 in the S. .P 500 buys only about $4. 69 in annual earnings, down from $5. 06 before the election. There is always the possibility of a major correction  —   something that would be true no matter who was in the Oval Office. If that scares you, your money probably shouldn’t be in the stock market. If you are planning to tap into those investments in the next few years and a 25 percent drop would be devastating, that’s all the more reason to limit your exposure to the market. Stocks tend to offer good   returns, but can deliver low or negative returns for many years at a time. Moving money out of stocks because you need it within the next few years and can’t stomach that kind of risk is one thing. But making a move just because you lack confidence in President Trump could be a case of letting ideology trump investing discipline.	1

While singing “Happy Birthday” to her son Nash, Jessica Eckerdt noticed that the cake had a hidden message written in the dinosaur’s legs.

It was the kind of story that was made for the Internet: It spread like wildfire on Twitter and Facebook and was aggregated by news websites like the Independent Review, The Frisky and Raw Story.It was also entirely made up.The Costco in Mesa?

And it did not explicitly note Costco’s U.S.-based website does not have an online ordering service for birthday cakes (the piece links to Costco’s Australian website, which does allow cakes to be ordered over the Internet, but has never offered the dinosaur design in question as an option).That didn’t stop Albrecht from seeing dollar signs. On Facebook, he told followers that his Inquisitr piece was a follow-up to the earlier one he had written for Examiner, which he claims also went viral and earned him around $3,000.[Jessica] Eckerdt, his girlfriend and the source for the story, also celebrated his success. In the story, she told Albrecht that when she received the cake last year, she was “extremely shocked and upset” and found it to be “very distasteful.” But on Facebook, she took a different tone, writing in a comment that the couple “ate the cake and found it hysterical.”	0
457	President Trump’s address to a joint session of Congress on Tuesday night elicited strong responses, and not a small measure of surprise. The New York Times spoke with a few voters who were watching from either side of the partisan divide. Here are excerpts from their immediate reactions. Rolando Valdes, 63, in sales and marketing for an international logistics company Home: Miami Voted: for Mr. Trump. Thinks he is: becoming a “  statesman. ” I think it’s the first time he acted presidential, but he has to concentrate on a few items. There are too many things at one time. He will lose the Republican Senate and the House with too many things. With Obamacare and with the tax cuts  —   that should be enough for the first four years. The best thing I liked is when he said we have to take care of the United States first before we do things for other people. The United States has been trying to be all things to all people. In the meantime, we have left our own people behind. I am pumped up. I hope he can do it. There is way too much politics in all of this. And this guy, whether we like him or we don’t, he is the only guy who is an outsider, and today he acted like a politician. It’s a good thing, because we need to get these things done. _____ Susy   54, criminal defense lawyer Home: Miami Voted: against Mr. Trump. Thinks he is: unrealistic and a ball of contradictions. Who was that unmasked man? I think it sounded great, like a utopia. I don’t think it’s that simple. He’s saying he’s going to do all these wonderful things  —   cut taxes, raise the defense budget. He talks about a great health care system and covering   conditions, and also talks about the disaster of Obamacare. And he talks about saving the jobs of the coal miners, but also increasing natural gas production. It’s one or the other. I think it’s oversimplified. I don’t know that he believes what he is saying. It can’t all be true. It’s simplistic and unrealistic. I did not at all like that there is going to be a victims fund specially for people who are the victims of crime by illegal aliens. Victims of crime are victims of crime no matter how or who. I think that Trump thinks he is a lot greater than he actually is. _____ Hollie Gaudette, 31, real estate agent Home: Manchester, N. H. Voted: for Mr. Trump. Thinks he is: “a problem solver. ” I got goose bumps through a lot of it, but I think the last woman  —   I can’t recall her name, but who lost her husband just a couple weeks ago  —   you see her pain, you can see her pain that was probably a very challenging and emotional moment for her to be there. And at that moment, that whole room came together, and there was support from both sides. That was wonderful to see. That’s what we want to see. The reality is that the   goal is that everyone comes together to move forward and to make progress and improve the quality of life for Americans across the board. It doesn’t matter whether you’re left or right, he’s saying, “I’m here for all Americans, it doesn’t matter what color, race, any of that. ” Even the whole part about immigration, he’s saying we’re going to have a merit system, and we want everyone and anyone to come here and succeed. _____ Charles Lovett, 72, retired administrator in the federal Department of Education Home: Franconia, N. H. Voted: against Mr. Trump. Thinks he is: “a problem. ” I think it was a pretty good speech for him. He didn’t rage about anything. He didn’t go off message. And so it came across as a coherent speech and it’s intended to be a   agenda. And I think he achieved that. But I think his policies are mistaken in many regards, and I think it comes across in some of the language he used. For example, he said we intend to fight terrorism and win. And there’s an underlying trope or assumption there that one can win militarily, which I don’t think is possible, and I don’t think the military thinks is possible. He spoke of people that were ignored by the media or silenced by special interests, and then he pulled up a bunch of people whose relations have been killed by immigrant felons, and it was to me, I found it a kind of grotesque mischaracterization of the way the country is. I found the seeming rationality and conventionality of the agenda to be disturbing, because I think the underlying beliefs, which I believe are mistaken, will lead to taking apart things and breaking things  —   like alliances, like health care  —   that are easy to take apart but very difficult to put back together. _____ Sandra Wright, 68, retail merchandiser Home: Waterloo, Iowa Voted: for Mr. Trump. Thinks he is: a “total patriot. ” I was very, very impressed with how well he presented himself. I thought he acted and spoke as presidentially as I’ve seen him so far. I was very impressed with what a   speech he had. I think it was very authentic. I think the man’s a true patriot for our country. I liked it very much. I particularly liked his closing remarks. And I was able to reinforce my reasons for voting for him. He didn’t fall into trying to fight back against all the attacks that have been against him and everything. He talked about our country, and he talked about the important issues facing our country. And I think that’s what his job’s all about, and I think he thinks that, too. His job is to represent the U. S. in the world and to protect us and defend us according to our Constitution, and uphold our laws. And I think he’s doing a great job of it, just like I always have. So I loved it. I particularly liked his remarks  —   and his statement, his campaign speeches, his promises to us  —   to preserve our Constitution, to enforce the rule of law as it pertains to illegal immigration, regardless. We have to follow our rules of law in the United States. I’m very impressed with how he realizes that this country is in financial crisis and the only way for us to get back from that is to go back to our American dream times, and work hard and bring manufacturing and those things back to the United States  —   what this country was built on. _____ Liza Kate Boisineau, 38, musician and waitress Home: Richmond, Va. Voted: against Mr. Trump. Thinks he is: arrogant, smug and stubborn. I don’t even know where to start. It was really hard to watch. It started out sounding like he cared a bit. It almost felt a little bit hopeful. I was almost impressed. He maintained a calmness and an air of wanting to bring people together. He did talk a lot about the need for peace and how there should be less conflict. I didn’t understand how he could talk so much about that while wanting to increase military funding so much. Then he talked about a wall and buy American and hire American. It just seemed hypocritical. As soon as he turned to this movement starting in 2016 and him becoming president, that turned me off. It turned me off because that’s just what he’s been spouting for so long now. What is so great about him having been elected? I don’t think he could ever see himself as being wrong, which bothers me.	1
740	 What has our world come to when we have to issue warnings about Christian contentPosted by Mark Zajac on Tuesday, December 15, 2015 A Charlie Brown Christmas, a recent holiday tradition with strong Christian undertones, celebrated its 50th Anniversary on ABC Family last night … Before the opening scene and after every commercial break, ABC Family used a disclaimer warning audiences of potentially “offensive and dangerous” religious content found in the dialogue of the program, similar to the disclaimers seen on adult shows that warn viewers of graphic content or strong language. The disclaimer in question for Charlie Brown read: “WARNING: This program contains strong Christian messages and may be offensive to some viewers. Viewer discretion advised.”The disclaimer was admittedly a compromise solution by ABC Family, who in the past had openly objected to the Christian messages in the program, but was forced nonetheless to air the program uncensored under the pressure from its audiences. Thus, the ‘trigger warning’ was added allegedly out of fear of offending or upsetting those audiences who did not demand to see the show…	0
611	 A Barstow, California woman is claiming that an accident she caused on the highway was related to an image she saw of Jesus in her Kit Kat candy bar. Marlo Thomas, 33, says she was traveling south on the I-15 when she suddenly began craving sweets. “It was like a feeling out of nowhere, I felt like I needed some sugar,” said Thomas. “I unwrapped the package, took a bite, and couldn’t believe what I saw. It was Jesus! I mean, right there, Jesus in my candy bar! It was like he was telling me I am chosen. So I closed my eyes and started praying, thanking Jesus for His revelation.”According to Thomas, it was during her “prayer time” that she slammed into the car in front of her at a speed of 75 mph. That car proceeded to hit several other cars in front of it that were at a traffic standstill due to an accident 2 miles ahead. “Miraculously,” Thomas only suffered minor cuts and bruises and walked away from the accident practically unscathed. “Jesus saved me,” said Thomas. “It was because I was praying that I was not hurt. Too bad for the guy in front of me. If he had been praying too, things probably wouldn’t have been so bad for him. But obviously he was not praying. He should use his time more wisely”	0
122	On Valentine’s Day, couples often reminisce about that moment they knew they would stay together, whether during a vacation, over a fancy dinner or, perhaps, while meeting their future  . For Isaac and Rosa Blum, who became teenage sweethearts 75 years ago in a ghetto in   Poland, that moment came as they and thousands of other terrified Jews were being herded to a death camp by Nazi soldiers. “I saw her walking in front of me,” Mr. Blum recalled. “I went up to the German and told him, ‘That’s my sister,’ even though she was my girlfriend. ” Miraculously, they were both pulled off the line and managed to survive the Holocaust by working as slave laborers in a munitions factory. The following 70 years have been a cinch by comparison, the couple said on Monday in their   house in the Manhattan Beach neighborhood of Brooklyn. He is 94, and she is a year younger. Asked to recount their lengthy love affair, they noted the absurdity of couching it  —   a romance incubated in the hell of the Holocaust  —   in the frilly trappings of Valentine’s Day. “You have a mixed story here  —   you won’t be able to put them together,” Mr. Blum said, even while acknowledging that, yes, it was young, bold love that prodded him to stand up to a Nazi guard and save his sweetheart from being sent to the Treblinka death camp. A hasty marriage followed, and then a horrific honeymoon of sorts: stealing glances and brief exchanges under the stern watch of armed guards. By 1941, the Nazis had taken over the Polish city of Czestochowa and established a ghetto of about 45, 000 Jews. It was in this grim setting that the two met, flirted, gathered with friends, played records and danced together. By autumn 1942, the Nazis were rounding up Jews for extermination. Mr. Blum was pulled from the line to work in the factory, while his family was pushed onward toward the trains bound for Treblinka. He would never see his family again. In that chaotic, horrific moment, he spied Rosa, brazenly approached a Nazi officer and tried to save the teenage girl up ahead walking with her family. A Nazi soldier grabbed her and asked if she was Isaac’s sister, as he had claimed. She said yes. “I was young and strong and able to work,” she said. “He said, ‘Come with me,’ and I was pulled out of the line. ” The memories are still vivid and bitter today, but the silver lining is that they still have each other to grow old with, living largely independently and doting on each other. He calls her a Polish term of affection that translates to “old one. ” She calls him simply Blum, and makes his favorite soups every day. Mr. Blum is a   type who considers holding hands silly and, truth be told, has little use for Valentine’s Day. “He’s not very romantic,” Mrs. Blum said, but his thoughtfulness reveals itself in little gifts and almost begrudging acts of tenderness. “We have a different point of view, but somehow we’ve survived,” she said. “What keeps us together are the quarrels. That’s the cement of a marriage. ” “I love him in spite of all his defects,” she said. “It’s not so easy, but I wouldn’t change him for somebody else. ” They are both sharp and physically and socially active, even if they are no longer the strapping youngsters who were selected for labor by the Nazis. With their families sent to their deaths, they were placed in a smaller ghetto of about 5, 000 Jews and, the lie about being siblings never detected, they were issued a marriage license so they could live briefly in a residence for couples before being separated in different barracks at the factory site, which was patrolled by armed guards. They toiled long hours, she as a welder and he as an electrician, which gave him the chance to approach her workstation to share covert glances. They treasured their few minutes of contact during “  lunch,” Mrs. Blum recalled. “We didn’t know if we were going to live, so we wanted to be together,” he said. When word filtered out that most Jews were being killed at death camps, they were incredulous, and counted themselves lucky despite their misery. “We didn’t know you could build factories to kill people,” Mr. Blum said. “We didn’t want to believe it. ” As Mrs. Blum fixed lunch for her husband on Monday, she said she still had nightmares about the horrors, which included being   with a group of women while German soldiers watched and laughed. And she was in a medical ward after being pushed down some stairs by a Nazi. She shared the ward with a young Jewish woman who tried to hide her pregnancy from the Nazis. Jewish nurses drowned the newborn in a bucket, fearing that the baby’s cries would doom them all. After being liberated by the Allies near the end of the war in 1945, the couple stayed in a displaced persons camp and were married a second time, by a city official in Austria with borrowed rings. Soon after, they managed to buy their own rings with a silver coin they had hidden for months. The two rings wore down over the years, and the Blums never replaced them. They moved to Argentina and were married a third time, in a more proper service. They had two children and then moved in 1963 to New York City, where Mr. Blum opened a furrier business, with Mrs. Blum doing much of the handiwork. They stay busy through programs for Holocaust survivors offered by Selfhelp Community Services, which is partly financed by   of New York and the Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against Germany. Reflecting on why he risked his life by approaching the Nazi soldier that day in 1942, Mr. Blum said simply, “I wanted to be with her. ” Then, Mrs. Blum looked adoringly at her unromantic,    savior and said, “They could have killed him right away on the spot, but he loved me and he wanted to keep me. ”	1
475	Valentina Sampaio is one of those leggy, lush brunette models for which Brazil is famous. And it was her striking beauty and “sparkling personality,” the French Vogue editor Emmanuelle Alt said, that led her to feature the    on the magazine’s March cover. Ms. Alt wrote in her editor’s letter that transgender people are “the ultimate of a rejection of conformity”  —   the sort of “icons that Vogue supports and chooses to celebrate. ” French Vogue is not the first fashion magazine to feature a transgender model on its cover. Hari Nef appeared on Frische, a   fashion and art magazine, in 2014 Andreja Pejić was on Marie Claire Spain a year ago and Ms. Sampaio on Elle Brazil last October, to name a few. But the action was groundbreaking for the Vogue empire as well as the French fashion establishment, in part because of the cover line  —   “Transgender beauty: How it’s shaking up the world”  —   below Ms. Sampaio’s face. Ms. Alt wrote that being transgender “is a detail one would prefer not to have to mention,” adding that Ms. Sampaio was not on the cover only for her looks “but because despite herself she embodies an   arduous struggle to be recognized and not be perceived as something Other, a gender exile. ” French Vogue’s editorial choices have long pushed social limits. In the 1970s, it published sexually charged images by Guy Bourdin and Helmut Newton, most notably Mr. Newton’s 1979 picture of Gia Carangi, fashion’s first openly lesbian model, wearing an Yves Saint Laurent evening gown and being seduced by an androgynous woman in a Saint Laurent tuxedo. (It is worth noting that Ms. Sampaio greatly resembles Ms. Carangi.) In 2007, Carine Roitfeld, then the French Vogue editor, ran a Bruce   cover of the   blonde Carolyn Murphy horsing around with Andre J. a black, bearded androgynous model who was wearing a   mini trench. Still, the fact that the current issue reached newsstands the same week that President Trump reversed federal policy protecting some rights of transgender students  —   and during a French presidential campaign in which   populism looms  —   made Ms. Alt’s cover statement that much more pointed. Jonathan Newhouse, the chairman and chief executive of Condé Nast International, the parent company of French Vogue, called the cover a brilliant decision. “It reinforces the power of the Vogue brand as a bold, innovative and highly relevant voice in the worlds of journalism and fashion,” Mr. Newhouse said. “I am not aware of any commercial impact, either positive or negative. My impression is a lot of people liked it. ” Olivier Lalanne, the magazine’s deputy editor, said the public response had been “positive and encouraging” with “no backlash at all for the moment. ” Ms. Sampaio concurred. “I’ve only had supercool feedback,” she said last week. On her Instagram feed, @valentts, her following has shot up by several thousand to more than 53, 000, and the Vogue cover image has received laudatory comments such as “You are beautiful,” “History made” and “#finally. ” It helps that Mert Alas and Marcus Piggott, the photographers who shot the cover and its accompanying fashion story, were careful to avoid clichés or fetishizing Ms. Sampaio. The magazine published two cover versions: In one, Ms. Sampaio shimmers in a gold lamé Saint Laurent evening gown, her   eyes piercing a haunting violet light in the second, a   she is bathed in a flare of fuchsia. For the fashion spread, Ms. Alt dressed Ms. Sampaio in a series of sexy 1970s throwbacks, such as a Louis Vuitton   sheer black gown over a black cutout bodysuit a Balenciaga red poppy print blouse and skintight pants and a pair of slouchy Dolce  Gabbana leopard print sequined pants, her naked torso and modest breasts painted gold. “It’s not gratuitous,” Mr. Lalanne said. “It makes sense as a story, therefore it doesn’t shock. ” Ms. Sampaio, who grew up in Aquiraz, a fishing town in northern Brazil, said, “I always felt like a girl. ” She refused to reveal what her name was before she chose Valentina, or when she transitioned, but did allow that her father, a fisherman, and her mother, a schoolteacher, “were always supportive and are very proud” of her choice. Her schoolmates accepted her, too, “since they already saw me as a little girl. ” She was studying fashion when she was discovered by a makeup artist a few years ago and signed by a modeling agency based in São Paulo. At first, there were a few “incidents,” as she puts it  —   clients who refused to hire her because she was transgender  —   and she considered giving up her new career. But after other transgender models, like Ms. Pejić, Ms. Nef and Lea T, Riccardo Tisci’s muse, moved firmly into the fashion mainstream, Ms. Sampaio found herself working steadily for magazines and on the runways. Last year, L’Oréal produced a short film about Ms. Sampaio, which it released on International Women’s Day. She is now one of the brand’s ambassadors. It was Mr. Alas and Mr. Piggott who brought Ms. Sampaio to the attention of Ms. Alt and Mr. Lalanne. “They found her beautiful,” Mr. Lalanne said. “And we agreed. ” Ms. Sampaio traveled to London for the shoot in December and had no idea it included the cover until she was on the set. “For Vogue to shine a light on someone who changed her sex when it is such a hotly debated topic projects a calming image of tolerance,” Mr. Lalanne said. “Fashion is freer than other domains in the arts. It opens doors, and we are able to highlight people who are social antagonists. So we have. ” As for Ms. Alt, she said she longed for the day when a transgender person “poses on the front cover of a fashion magazine and it is no longer necessary to write an editorial on the subject. ” Only then, she said, “will we know that the battle is won. ”	1
834	 Did Trump call Jesus a socialist loser? Donald Trump said Tuesday that Jesus Christ was a ‘socialist loser’ because he used to feed the poor and heal the sick.Then Trump — the Republican presidential contender who has captured the hearts and minds of at least 20% of the nation’s Republicans — vowed:“Believe me, Trump would never help the poor.”“I would never give away medicine for free. Jesus was weak. Let me tell you something, Jesus is not god. He’s god because he was crucified. I like gods that weren’t crucified.”“Perhaps he’s god, but right now, Jesus hasn’t done anything in 2000 years,” Trump added. “Jesus gets up there and starts bleeding out on the cross. Trump wouldn’t do that. He has blood coming out of his sides, his eyes, his feet, blood coming out of his wherever. Just disgusting.” “He’s not a war hero. He’s a war hero because he was captured. I like people who weren’t captured.” God made the world. Then he flooded it. Then God went to sleep for about 2000 years. Anyway, eventually God woke up and felt pretty bad for what he’d done in the past. In 2011, after years of therapy, God started this Holy and Divine God Facebook Page to restore his good name.	0
208	Irwin Stambler, who was trained as an aeronautics engineer but whose deep love for music inspired him to write “The Encyclopedia of Pop, Rock and Soul”  —   a major feat of research before the internet made it easier to find out more about Bo Diddley or the Beach Boys  —   died on Feb. 10 in Los Angeles. He was 92. His son Lyndon that said the cause was complications of sepsis. Mr. Stambler’s encyclopedia, published by St. Martin’s Press in 1974, covered a wide swath of music history, from Acid Rock to the Zombies, in an    style. His entry about the singer Marianne Faithfull, for example, called her the “daughter of a baroness and blessed with the face of an angel (some observers said a fallen angel),” and added that she was “well educated in convent schools, but the sheltered atmosphere of those years probably contributed to her desire to kick over the traces. ” Mr. Stambler’s book was not the first of its kind. It was preceded by “Lillian Roxon’s Rock Encyclopedia,” published by Grosset  Dunlap in 1969. But it was published nearly a decade before one from a more traditional authority on rock: Rolling Stone magazine. Holly   who edited the second and third editions of  “The Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock  Roll,” said in an email, “I remember the Stambler book as being a valuable resource and a tool for   the entries in our own book. ” Mr. Stambler toggled regularly between science and music throughout his career. He worked as an engineer into the 1950s  —   designing aircraft parts, among other assignments  —   but then shifted full time into writing about aerospace and technology, as well as music and sports. He wrote for magazines like Space Aeronautics. He wrote newsletters. And he wrote dozens of books on subjects as diverse as the space program, drag racing, minibikes, the fastest humans, the     aircraft, the pitcher Catfish Hunter and the basketball star Bill Walton. By 1969, he had already written two music encyclopedias: one on popular music and a second on country, with Grelun Landon, a music industry executive. In an unpublished memoir, Mr. Stambler said that he had wanted to write the rock encyclopedia in the 1960s but that his publisher resisted in favor of a somewhat tamer subject. So he wrote “Encyclopedia of Popular Music” (1965) instead, insisting, however, that he be able to sprinkle in some biographical entries on rock pioneers like Elvis Presley and Bill Haley. Haley actually did not end up in the book, but Presley did, as did rock ’n’ rollers like Fats Domino and the Everly Brothers. Andy Leach, the senior director of library and archives at the Rock  Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland, said that Mr. Stambler’s popular music encyclopedia was groundbreaking “because popular music wasn’t being taken seriously by most scholars or serious writers at the time. ” The subsequent rock encyclopedia, he added, has become a “standard reference. ” Irwin Stambler was born in Brooklyn on Nov. 20, 1924. His father, Sidney, owned a jewelry and silver fabrication company, and his mother, the former Bessie Levine, taught piano. He attended New York University, his time there broken up by two years of Army service during World War II, after which he returned and received bachelor’s and master’s degrees in aeronautical engineering. Music was always a passion. He preferred not to play classical piano, as his mother did, but he wrote pop songs with a partner, Morton Weinberg, with titles like “Strawberry Sky,” “Fade Out” and “Indigo Blue. ” He built up a collection of close to 8, 000 records and CDs. “Music was always on at home,” Lyndon Stambler said. “Dad played guitar, and I made a harp in high school. He loved all music. “Before my    married my brother, one of the first images she saw of my dad was of him lying on his bed, wearing headphones and listening to Led Zeppelin. When she saw that, she knew everything was going to be O. K. ” In addition to Lyndon, Mr. Stambler is survived by his wife, the former Constance Lebowitz another son, Barrett two daughters, Amy Sprague Champeau and Alice Seidman nine grandchildren and eight  . While Mr. Stambler was researching his pop music encyclopedia, he scheduled an interview with the songwriter Jimmy Van Heusen in Palm Springs, Calif. during time off from an aerospace meeting nearby. Mr. Van Heusen, who wrote the music for “Call Me Irresponsible” and other standards, kept filling Mr. Stambler’s glass with expensive whiskey while they talked. “To this day, I can’t recall how I got back to my car,” Mr. Stambler wrote in his memoir. “All I know is that I woke up the next morning in bed with a miserable hangover but with a notebook filled with more than enough for a good encyclopedia entry. ”	1
483	WASHINGTON  —   It was “find the Affordable Care Act replacement” day on Thursday as   Democrats  —   and one frustrated Republican  —   scampered through Capitol corridors, hunting for an elusive copy of a bill that Republican leaders have withheld from the public as they search for party unity. Just a week before two powerful House committees plan to vote on the measure, opponents spent hours making the point that almost no one has actually seen legislation that would affect the lives and pocketbooks of millions of Americans. “The Republicans have played    with us,” said Representative Lloyd Doggett, Democrat of Texas. Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin said party leaders were determined to plow ahead with repeal legislation, despite lingering disagreements among Republicans and outright opposition from Democrats. “I am perfectly confident that when it’s all said and done, we’re going to unify, because we all, every Republican, ran on repealing and replacing, and we’re going to keep our promises,” Mr. Ryan said. The Energy and Commerce Committee, which has jurisdiction over Medicaid, and the Ways and Means Committee, which is responsible for tax legislation, are tentatively scheduled to vote next week on the repeal bill, setting the stage for the full House to vote on it later this month, House Republican leaders said. While Republicans discussed details of the health care bill, Democrats went from office to office, hunting for a copy. Lawmakers were told that Republican members of the Energy and Commerce Committee could inspect the bill on Thursday in the basement of a House office building. When Democrats arrived, they were directed to a room on the first floor of the Capitol. The House Democratic whip, Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, and Representative Paul Tonko, Democrat of New York, went to that room, but could not find the bill there. Senator Rand Paul, a Kentucky Republican who has criticized the repeal bill, also tried and failed to see it. “I have been told that the House Obamacare bill is under lock  key, in a secure location,  not available for me or the public to view,” Mr. Paul said on Twitter as he set off in search of the document, carrying a portable copy machine and trailed by television cameras and a pack of journalists. Mr. Paul supports repealing the Affordable Care Act, but said the measure described publicly by House Republican leaders included “Democratic ideas dressed up in Republican clothing. ” Mr. Hoyer, whose quest for the bill was broadcast live on Facebook, paused to address a large bust of Abraham Lincoln. “I can’t find the bill,” he said, adding, “I know, Mr. Lincoln, you are as upset with your party as I am today. ” The theatrics reflected serious concerns. “Republicans are hiding their draft A. C. A. repeal bill in a basement room,” said the House Democratic leader, Nancy Pelosi of California. The bill, she said, would produce “a big transfer of wealth to the wealthiest people in our country,” cutting their taxes while increasing costs for others. It is not unusual for controversial bills to be written by the majority party, with little or no input from the minority. But Democrats relished the opportunity to turn the tables on Republicans. In 2009 and 2010, Republicans excoriated Democrats for making “  deals” to pass the Affordable Care Act. Democrats, defending the bill they had written with President Barack Obama, were shouted down at town   meetings by Tea Party members chanting, “Read the bill. ” Representative Greg Walden, Republican of Oregon and chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, denied he was hiding the bill or doing anything out of the ordinary. Republicans, he said, “are continuing to discuss and refine draft legislative language. ” Asked if he was hiding the bill, Representative Kevin Brady, Republican of Texas and chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, said: “We don’t have a bill. We’re continuing to work with the Congressional Budget Office and our members on the final product. ” Republicans had promised an open process. Speaking on the House floor on Jan. 13, Representative Doug Collins of Georgia, the vice chairman of the House Republican Conference, said the health law had been enacted “after months of   deals, in the middle of the night,   deals, and without giving the American people enough time to even read the bill. ” “That is not what is going to happen this time,” he said. The Congressional Budget Office has not completed an estimate of the cost of the repeal bill or its effects on coverage, and Republicans are still trying to narrow their differences on issues like Medicaid and tax credits to help people buy insurance. But, as of Thursday, they were determined to move ahead. “We are going to mark up the legislation next week,” said Representative Billy Long, Republican of Missouri and a member of the Energy and Commerce Committee, after a   meeting of House Republicans. “They say we’ll be there all night. I’m going to bring an air mattress. ” Mr. Ryan presented members of his party on Thursday with a timeline leading to passage of the bill by the House within three weeks. The Senate is working closely with House leaders. Mr. Ryan told House Republicans that President Trump supported the bill drafted by House Republican leaders, according to aides who were in the room. Ever since Mr. Obama signed the law in March 2010, Republicans have been trying to uproot it. When Congress convened this year, Republicans thought they could achieve their goal with a quick strike on the law, which has provided insurance to some 20 million Americans. The task has proved more difficult than they expected. Polls show the law has become somewhat more popular as Mr. Trump and congressional Republicans try to kill it. Under a draft of the bill that became public last week, the government would offer tax credits to help lower the cost of insurance for people who did not have access to coverage through an employer or a government program. The tax credits, as initially proposed, would be available to people regardless of their income. Representative Phil Roe, Republican of Tennessee, said the credit should not be available to people with incomes above a certain level, around $118, 000. “I don’t think I need a tax credit, with my salary,” Mr. Roe said. As a member of Congress, he has been paid $174, 000 a year.	1

424	Like farmers eyeing the sky for a welcome rain cloud, people have been peering through the White House fence at the organic kitchen garden, searching for signs of activity. During the Obama administration, the garden’s heirloom vegetables and stream of visiting chefs and schoolchildren became a stage set for Michelle Obama, who built her legacy on promoting good cooking, healthful eating and exercise. The    collection of raised beds became such a potent political symbol that after the fall election, protesters brandished signs demanding that the new administration keep its hands off their genitalia and the garden. To the great relief of chefs and other supporters of the garden, Melania Trump has announced that she will keep it going. But they are still waiting for more definitive signs of how the Trumps will feed themselves and their guests, and whether they will set  —   as previous administrations have  —   a culinary example for the nation. By virtue of tradition and archaic gender assignments, the complex work of managing food for the White House has always fallen to the first lady. But Mrs. Trump has no plans to move to Washington until the summer and has said little publicly about what she expects or wants from the cooking and entertaining staff. “Without a   first lady, they’re just pumping out food and seeing what the reaction is,” said Adrian Miller, a lawyer turned food writer who was a special assistant to President Bill Clinton and whose new book, “The President’s Kitchen Cabinet,” examines the role   have played in every White House kitchen. “Usually, the food suffers when the first lady is uninterested,” Mr. Miller added. “Eleanor Roosevelt was a great example. The food was so bad people actually thought about eating first before going to the White House. ” Mrs. Trump only recently brought on additional staff members to help arrange state dinners and other official meals at the White House, the first of which was the   Governors Ball on Sunday. In past administrations, details down to the provenance of the flatware were made public. Not so this year. However, The New York Times obtained a menu: East Coast salmon and a salad of spring peas with pickled ramps, roasted   steaks from Virginia and Boston cream pie with vanilla ice cream. The first couple prefers entertaining at    President Trump’s resort in Palm Beach, Fla. Mr. Trump, a    man who likes his steaks well done and perceives fast food as both efficient and sanitary, takes some of his meals in the White House mess, a small staff dining hall near the Situation Room in the West Wing. Mrs. Trump, who had a robust career in modeling, is a champion of drinking water and eating a lot of fruit. The first person she hired was Stephanie Winston Wolkoff, who as senior adviser will help set the first lady’s agenda and fill her staff. Ms. Winston Wolkoff, a New York party planner and former Vogue publicist, agreed to forward to Mrs. Trump a list of questions about her vision for food and entertaining at the White House, but Mrs. Trump did not respond. Some people have speculated that Mr. Trump’s daughter Ivanka, who gardens with her children and whose favorite recipes include broccoli kugel and her   ’s veal Marsala, may take on some of the duties. But don’t expect to see her stamp on White House food, other than perhaps more kosher meals for her Orthodox Jewish family. Ivanka Trump will not be a shadow first lady, said Risa Heller, who handles personal communications for her. In a statement, Hope Hicks, a White House spokeswoman, said, “Ivanka is not involved, but looks forward to seeing the traditions continue under the first lady, who will do an amazing job overseeing these important and historical institutions. ” The president has, of course, the power to set food policy for the entire nation. While Mr. Trump has yet to address the topic directly, he has tipped his hand with tough positions on trade and immigration and his nomination of former Gov. Sonny Perdue of Georgia as agriculture secretary. Mr. Perdue is a former grain trader with ties to large agribusiness interests. Mr. Trump clearly understands the theatrical and symbolic power of food. During the campaign, he declared his preference for Kentucky Fried Chicken and taco bowls  —   the latter, apparently, as a way to appeal to Hispanic voters. He has said that there will be no dinners honoring heads of state as long as the United States has a trade deficit, and that if the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, made a state visit, he would serve him a Big Mac instead of the Colorado lamb with garlic fried milk and baby broccoli that the leader ate with President Barack Obama. Mr. Trump keeps copies of menus from important events, including the card from his January lunch with the British prime minister, Theresa May, which featured his favorite wedge salad with blue cheese, beef ribs and salted crème brûlée. Cultural pundits have long debated whether the food at the White House shapes how the nation eats, or vice versa. There is evidence for both. Mamie Eisenhower, a military wife enamored of the convenience foods popular in the 1950s, oversaw a thrifty White House kitchen, demanding that the staff make smart use of leftovers. Jacqueline Kennedy hired a French chef and remade White House dining, though public opinion forced her to start serving American wine and writing menus in English rather than French. Ronald and Nancy Reagan helped popularize elegant dining and Jelly Bellies, while George and Barbara Bush favored casual dining and pork rinds. The idea of a White House garden began to take on political implications when the California chef Alice Waters pestered Bill and Hillary Clinton to install an organic one. Although the White House rejected the notion, saying a kitchen garden would not be in keeping with the formality of the grounds, the Clintons did plant a vegetable garden on the roof. They also hired the White House’s first American chef. The Obamas more fully embraced America’s increasing interest in food culture and agriculture, dining at notable new restaurants and opening up the White House to visiting chefs. “We became ‘foodie aware,’” said Bill Yosses, the head pastry chef in the White House under the Obamas and George and Laura Bush. “It was a good way for new information to make its way to the White House, because you are so closed off from the world. ” Mrs. Trump is under no obligation to retain the current White House chef, Cristeta Comerford, or its pastry chef, Susie Morrison, the first women to hold those positions. But there is little indication that their jobs are in peril. Their employment could depend on how well they get along with Anna Cristina Niceta Lloyd, known as Rickie, whom Mrs. Trump named as social secretary on Feb. 17. Ms. Niceta Lloyd, an account executive for a Washington caterer, helped coordinate the traditional lunch after Mr. Trump’s  . She will oversee social events like the Easter Egg Roll, and help plan state dinners and other official meals, working with the White House chief usher, the State Department and Ms. Comerford. Ms. Niceta Lloyd did not respond to a request for an interview, and it is not clear how much of a hand she will have in planning official menus. In the past, chefs have tried out dishes for a state dinner at a tasting hosted by the first lady. In the Obama administration, that menu would sometimes include specific vegetables grown for the occasion. The kitchen garden, which has produced 2, 000 pounds of food a year, planted a flag for the farmers’ market crowd. Its bounty became diplomatic gifts, with Mr. Obama handing out honey from the hives, tea bags made from chamomile and carved wooden boxes of seeds, one of which he gave to Pope Francis. Although a large garden paving stone bears Mrs. Obama’s name and her call to grow a healthier nation for America’s children, there is no reason Mrs. Trump couldn’t put her own stamp on the garden, said George Ball, the chairman and chief executive of the Burpee seed company. His company and the Burpee Foundation have pledged $2. 5 million to the National Park Foundation to keep the garden tended for at least 17 years. He has urged Mrs. Trump to turn the garden into a showplace for Slovenian produce, the star of which would be the Raka red onion. It’s a hybrid that her maternal grandfather created by crossbreeding an Egyptian red onion with a local Slovenian onion from the town of Ptuj. It is named after his home village, which is known for its onions. Mrs. Trump, whose mother left her work harvesting those onions for a job in a textile mill, does not appear to be particularly connected to her agricultural roots. But Mr. Ball plans to have seeds imported from Slovenia to present to her by the summer, and hopes he can persuade the first family to embrace vegetables, a point he has made in the opinion pages of some daily newspapers. “You have a very   job so, Mr. Trump, you will get far more nutrition from more fresh vegetables,” he said in an interview. Tanya Steel, the editorial director of the media company Clean Plates, who created a series of Kids’ State Dinners at the White House, said healthful eating should remain a theme under the new administration. “I can see it mapping beautifully if they are really focused on making America great again,” she said. “There isn’t any reason that healthy eating can’t be a bipartisan effort. ” Sam Kass, Mr. Obama’s senior policy adviser for nutrition, cooked for the first family and was executive director for Mrs. Obama’s Let’s Move campaign. He doesn’t anticipate a   administration. “I don’t expect to see President Trump expounding the value of spinach and broccoli,” he said. But he is not worried about how changes at the White House will affect the American diet. “This country is already changing,” he said. “We are demanding better food and healthier food. Even on a policy level, I’m not too concerned. ”	1
282	Prosecutors in Ukraine are investigating whether a member of Parliament committed treason by working with two associates of President Trump’s to promote a plan for settling Ukraine’s conflicts with Russia. In a court filing on Tuesday, prosecutors accused the lawmaker, Andrii V. Artemenko, of conspiring with Russia to commit “subversive acts against Ukraine,” in particular by advancing a proposal that could “legitimize the temporary occupation” of the Crimean peninsula. Russia forcibly annexed the peninsula in 2014, a step that Ukraine, the United States and other governments have refused to recognize Mr. Artemenko said his proposal would allow Ukraine to formally cede control of the territory to Russia, at least temporarily. Yuriy Lutsenko, Ukraine’s prosecutor general, posted a copy of the court filing to his Facebook page on Tuesday with the statement “Ukraine’s integrity is above all else. ” Mr. Artemenko’s plan, reported on Sunday by The New York Times, outlines a series of steps meant to bring to an end the rebellion by   separatists in eastern Ukraine, and to resolve the dispute over Crimea by allowing voters to decide whether to lease the peninsula to Russia for 50 or 100 years. Settling those issues could give the Trump administration a path to lift sanctions against Russia. Mr. Artemenko traveled to New York in January to discuss the plan with Michael D. Cohen, Mr. Trump’s personal lawyer, and with Felix H. Sater, a   business associate of the Trump Organization who scouted business opportunities in Russia for the company as recently as 2015. Mr. Cohen said he delivered the proposal to the White House in a sealed envelope in early February. Mr. Artemenko, a   politician who has tried to brand himself as a   populist, has not been arrested or formally charged with a crime. He did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Ukrainian news outlet Strana. ua quoted him as saying that the investigation was “politically motivated. ” “I’m not going anywhere, and will meet with investigators to explain my position,” he was quoted as saying. Mr. Artemenko has claimed he received encouragement from the Russian authorities for his effort, but the Kremlin has denied any knowledge of his proposal. He has also claimed to have evidence of corruption that could help lead to the ouster of the Ukrainian president, Petro O. Poroshenko. The Trump administration has sent mixed signals concerning the war in Ukraine, which has cost more than 10, 000 lives. White House officials have suggested that they would be open to lifting sanctions against Russia, but they have also demanded that Crimea be returned to Ukraine. Word of Mr. Artemenko’s peace plan has prompted outrage among many officials in Ukraine. Some accused him of being a secret Russian agent, and there have been calls for him to relinquish his seat in Parliament. On Monday, fellow Radical Party lawmakers voted unanimously to expel him from the party. The suggestion that Crimea be handed over to Russia legally, even for a limited time, particularly outraged Crimean Tatars, the ethnic group in Ukraine whose members consider the peninsula their historic homeland. Refat Chubarov, a Tatar member of Parliament, wrote on Facebook that Mr. Artemenko should be stripped of his parliamentary immunity and arrested. “Given the continued Russian occupation of Crimea,” he wrote, “which is characterized by the total suppression of the rights and freedoms of the Crimea Tatar people violent kidnappings and killings of peaceful citizens arrests of Crimean Tatar citizens and attacks on their homes and families as well as the persecution of journalists, the actions of Andrii Artemenko are unequivocally qualified as treason. ”	1

Ted Cruz (R-Texas) sent shockwaves through the Republican Party today when he announced that he would endorse Donald Trump for President, but only if the GOP nominee would be willing to publicly support a ban on masturbation. The Senator called this ‘The single most important issue facing the country today’ and that without ‘swift action by the next President the country was doomed to slide down a slippery slope of debauchery and self-satisfaction’. In an interview on Capitol Hill with MSNBC’s Hallie Jackson, Cruz wouldn’t offer a timeline on when he’ll make a decision on whether or not to support the GOP nominee, offering only that he was “giving it time, watching and assessing.”Story Continued Below“I, like many other voters am watching and listening what he says and what he does,” Cruz said. “That’s what millions of voters are doing.

6	WASHINGTON  —   The commander of the   international military force in Afghanistan, warning that the United States and its NATO allies are facing a “stalemate,” told Congress on Thursday that he needed a few thousand additional troops to more effectively train and advise Afghan soldiers. “We have a shortfall of a few thousand,” Gen. John W. Nicholson said in a sober assessment of America’s longest war to the Senate Armed Services Committee . The international force that is helping the Afghans currently has 13, 300 troops, 8, 400 of whom are American. Afghan forces have taken heavy casualties over the last year as they have sought to hold off the Taliban and prevent them from capturing provincial capitals. General Nicholson repeated previous assessments that the sanctuary Taliban fighters and militant groups enjoy in Pakistan remains a major obstacle. “It is very difficult to succeed on the battlefield when your enemy enjoys external support and safe haven,” said the commander, who added that the United States needed to do a “a holistic review” of its policy toward Pakistan. The issue of safe havens in Pakistan also was discussed Thursday when the new defense secretary, Jim Mattis, spoke by telephone with Gen. Qamar Javed Bajwa, Pakistan’s chief of army staff. In the conversation, “Gen. Bajwa reiterated Pakistan’s commitment to counter all militant groups operating in its territory,” according to a Pentagon statement. In his Senate testimony, General Nicholson also complained that Russia was trying to “legitimize” the Taliban by creating the “false narrative” that the militant organization has been fighting the Islamic State and that Afghan forces have not. Russia’s goal, he asserted, was “to undermine the United States and NATO” in Afghanistan, expressing a far more skeptical view of the Kremlin’s intentions than President Trump. On the positive side, he said, the area in which Islamic State fighters operate in Afghanistan had been greatly reduced. General Nicholson’s argument amounted to an implicit criticism of the approach taken by former President Barack Obama, who imposed a series of rigid troop ceilings and significantly reduced the number of American forces in Afghanistan  —   though not by as much as he had initially projected. But the broader question is what course President Trump might chart on Afghanistan. Senator John McCain, the Arizona Republican who chairs the Armed Services Committee, said that for too long the United States strategy had been “not to lose,” and urged that a plan be devised to break the stalemate. General Nicholson said the administration was working on one. Michael T. Flynn, Mr. Trump’s national security adviser, served as an intelligence officer in Afghanistan. Mr. Mattis, Mr. Trump’s defense secretary, oversaw the military effort there when he served as the head of Central Command. Mr. Trump has said little about Afghanistan, although on Thursday he held his second call since his election with Ashraf Ghani, the nation’s president. “The two leaders spoke about the counterterrorism efforts, threat levels in Afghanistan, the capabilities of Afghan forces, as well as the risks of terrorism in the region and the countries that support terrorism,” said Nader Nadery, Mr. Ghani’s adviser on strategic affairs. Mr. Nadery said troop levels were not a focus of the call. But Afghan officials say Mr. Ghani and Mr. Trump spoke about the possibility of increasing troop levels if a military assessment showed the need for it during their first conversation, in early December. The war in Afghanistan is a topic the president has rarely discussed. “Hardly a word was mentioned by Trump about Afghanistan during the campaign, yet it remains one of the U. S.’s largest security expenditures,” said Daniel Feldman, who served as the senior envoy for Afghanistan and Pakistan during the Obama administration. Mr. Feldman said that a broad assessment was needed of the terrorist threat, the role of international partners and how to pursue reconciliation between the Afghan government and the Taliban. But he said there was no indication that the new administration had begun such a review. Explaining the need for more troops, General Nicholson indicated that there were sufficient Special Operations forces to carry out counterterrorism missions. The shortfall, he said, was in those training and advising the Afghans. Currently, advisers are mainly working with Afghans at the command level of army corps. But more advisers, he said, would enable the   coalition to advise at lower levels in the chain of command, most likely at the level of Afghan brigades. The use of military advisers is generally more effective if it is not limited to advising foreign armies in their military headquarters, but extends to units in the field. The Obama administration’s decision last summer to give American commanders more flexibility to provide air support for Afghan forces fighting the Taliban also increased the need for advisers below the level of Afghan army corps, General Nicholson said. He said that the thousands of additional advisers he was seeking could come from allied armies and did not all need to be American. But there appears to be little appetite among NATO nations to send more troops to Afghanistan. Assessing the Afghans’ military performance, General Nicholson said Afghan forces had suffered high casualties because of poor leadership and the excessive use of checkpoints. But he underscored that he was encouraged by the leadership within the country’s special forces and increasingly in its budding air force.	1
379	WARSAW  —   Political outsiders across Central Europe, preaching a populist message and promising to overturn the establishment, have felt the wind at their backs since the election of the new American president. We recently profiled one of them, Veselin Mareshki of Bulgaria, who says he sees himself as “an   candidate like Donald Trump. ” Many others embrace the connection, too, whether it is their backgrounds in business, their bombastic personalities, or their canny use of celebrity and social media. Andrej Babis, 62, Czech Republic Undoubtedly the      in Central Europe, Mr. Babis transformed an agribusiness conglomerate into a diversified corporate behemoth that includes major media properties. In 2011, he formed his own party, ANO, and promised to bring business sense to government on an anticorruption platform. The party did so well in parliamentary elections that Mr. Babis was named finance minister. He is widely considered the likeliest next prime minister. He has rejected comparisons with President Trump, whom he criticized as a poor businessman. But he has also added that he and the new American president share an aversion to immigration and a tendency to say politically incorrect things. Boris Kollar, 51, Slovakia  Mr. Kollar, a wealthy businessman, formed his own political party last year  —   Sme Rodina, or “We Are Family”  —   and shocked the Slovak establishment by earning 11 seats in the country’s   National Council on a platform of libertarian economics,   and fierce opposition to more immigration. His slogan: “Trust me, I’m not a politician. ” A   tabloid figure and media celebrity, Mr. Kollar has 10 children from nine different mothers. Bogoljub Karic, 63, Serbia Mr. Karic, along with three brothers and a sister, built a family business empire that has expanded to telecommunications, construction, finance, media and international trade. He also started the private BK University. But his initial foray into politics ended with his fleeing into exile in 2006, under investigation by Serbia’s chief organized crime prosecutor, which he characterized as politically motivated. Mr. Karic returned to Serbia on Dec. 30, just days after the prosecutor ended the investigation without charges. Mr. Karic denies he will run for president in the coming elections, but notes that his party, the Strength of Serbia Movement, recruited 60, 000 new members since his return from exile. Aivars Lembergs, 63, Latvia  The extent of Mr. Lembergs’s wealth, and its source, are fairly vague, but he has used his business and political acumen to remain the mayor and chief political force in the seaport of Ventspils, an office he has held since 1988, the year before communism fell. Flamboyant, outspoken and a familiar figure in Latvian media, Mr. Lembergs made his fortune in the tumultuous years after the transition to capitalism. His politics are populist. He refers to NATO as “an occupying force. ” And he remains the leading figure in a coalition between his party and the Union of Greens and Farmers, a   conglomeration of environmental activists and conservative farm groups. He has faced repeated charges of corruption, money laundering, bribery and abuse of office. Zbigniew Stonoga, 42, Poland  Mr. Stonoga owns two auto dealerships and is an avid blogger who created his own political party, named after himself. He is infamous for his blunt, and sometimes vulgar, language and for epic YouTube rants against “Zionists,” tax officials and Polish leaders. He opposes any fresh influx of migrants, whom he refers to using an American racist epithet. He is best known in Poland for having leaked a series of top secret documents from Poland’s Agency of Internal Security, resulting in the resignation of several ministers under the previous government. How he came to possess the documents has never been explained, though he insisted that he stumbled across them on a Chinese internet server. His Stonoga Polish Party collapsed after performing poorly in parliamentary elections, and he now channels his efforts through an online journal (also named after himself). Ivan Pernar, 31, Croatia Relatively young and still on the edges of Croatian politics, Mr. Pernar invites comparison with President Trump not for his background in business but for his position as a political outsider who uses social media and   attacks on opponents. He first came to public attention by using Facebook to organize a series of antigovernment protests in 2011 and seemed regularly at odds with political decorum. He was once scolded for eating pizza on the floor of Parliament. Mr. Pernar’s populist message is decidedly   and   but also includes some attitudes from the conspiratorial fringe, including dire warnings about the pernicious influence of Freemasons. Mr. Pernar was recently removed from the floor of Parliament for interrupting proceedings with random   Union diatribes.	1
149	Humana announced on Tuesday that it would no longer offer health insurance coverage in the state marketplaces created under the federal health care law, becoming the first major insurer to cast a   vote over selling individual plans on the public exchanges for 2018. President Trump immediately seized on the company’s decision as evidence that the Affordable Care Act needed to be repealed and replaced. “Obamacare continues to fail,” he said on Twitter. The company’s decision is likely to set off a contentious debate about who is to blame for the market’s current shakiness. While the president and Republicans have vowed to undo the health care law, they have yet to come up with a solid plan. Insurers are complaining loudly about the uncertainty surrounding what will happen in the coming years, even though many states’ exchanges have showed some signs of stability. Several major insurers have said they cannot begin to decide whether to offer coverage next year until the government clarifies if and how it plans to change the rules. Based in Louisville, Ky. Humana is not a major player in the individual exchanges and is among the national insurers, like Aetna and UnitedHealth Group, that have struggled to make money in the market. The company has steadily scaled back its presence, selling policies for 2017 in just 11 states. In early January, the company said the number of its customers buying coverage through the exchanges had dropped to about 150, 000, a small fraction of the roughly 12 million individuals who initially signed up for coverage through the exchanges. The company’s main focus has been selling private insurance under Medicare. Humana released word of its withdrawal on Tuesday after it announced that it would no longer pursue a merger with Aetna, another large insurer. The Justice Department won a legal challenge against the combination last month. The company cited an “initial analysis of data” about the type of customers who signed up for its plans this year, and it said that it saw no evidence that the market was improving but that it was “seeing further signs of an unbalanced risk pool,” as customers with expensive medical conditions continued to enroll as compared with healthy people. Humana’s move “could be a harbinger of things to come,” said Sabrina Corlette, a research professor at Georgetown University who studies the health insurance market and who has warned that the lack of clarity from Congress and the Trump administration could result an exodus by insurers. “These insurance companies are having to make business decisions in an environment of great uncertainty,” Professor Corlette said. “They’re not required to participate in these markets. ” Humana did not immediately respond to requests for comment, but the decision was also clearly intended to tell its shareholders and others how it viewed its future as a   company. “They’ve been pulling out of the market for a couple of years,” said Gary Claxton, a policy analyst for the Kaiser Family Foundation, who said it was not clear how much the current uncertainty might have affected the company’s thinking. “I don’t really think this was their future. ” On the same day, the fallout from the Justice Department’s decision to block the merger of two other large insurers, Anthem and Cigna, resulted in a lawsuit by Cigna seeking $13 billion in damages from Anthem. The two companies have been reluctant partners, and Anthem had recently vowed to appeal the judge’s decision to support the challenge by the Justice Department.	1
872	 According to Ralph Hammerstein, an attorney representing Shawn “Jay-Z” Carter and Beyonce Knowles-Carter, the couple is attempting to purchase rights to the Confederate flag to prevent further use of the flag on merchandise. According to Hammerstein, the couple is “in the works” of purchasing all resell rights to the confederate flag.“My clients are adamant about purchasing the rights to the Rebel Confederate flag. They have expressed deep concern regarding the flag and how it is tearing apart our nation. Mr. and Mrs. Carter wants to assist in the abolishment of the flag by purchasing the resell rights to the Confederate flag. If my clients are successful, purchasing the rights would mean that anyone who wants to produce merchandise using the Confederate flag would have to get permission from Mr. and Mrs. Carter. My clients have expressed that they are not looking to profit from the use of the flag but rather prevent any further use of the flag on merchandise,” according to Hammerstein.	0
256	BRUSSELS  —   They scan websites and pore over social media, combing through hundreds of reports a day. But the bogus claims just keep coming. Germans are fleeing their country, fearful of Muslim refugees. The Swedish government supports the Islamic State. The European Union has drafted rules to regulate the ethnicity of snowmen. In their   office overlooking a major thoroughfare in Brussels, an   team known as East Stratcom, serves as Europe’s front line against this onslaught of fake news. Created by the European Union to address “Russia’s ongoing disinformation campaigns,” the team  —   composed of diplomats, bureaucrats and former journalists  —   tracks down reports to determine whether they are fake. Then, it debunks the stories for hapless readers. In the 16 months since the team has been on the job, it has discredited 2, 500 stories, many with links to Russia. In a year when the French, Germans and Dutch will elect leaders, the European authorities are scrambling to counter a rising tide of fake news and   Union propaganda aimed at destabilizing people’s trust in institutions. As officials play   in the fight against sophisticated hacking and fake news operations, they fear Europe and its elections remain vulnerable at a critical moment: The region’s   project of unity hangs in the balance, challenged by populist forces within the bloc and pressures from Russia and beyond. “If you look at how European media, and even big American media, are covering the issue now, I would say that it is those few people on that team who have been able to raise awareness,” said Jakub Janda, a deputy director with European Values, a think tank based in Prague, who has worked with East Stratcom. Many false claims target politicians who present the biggest obstacles to Moscow’s goal of undermining the European Union. Others seek to portray refugees from the Middle East as terrorists or rapists, fomenting populist anger. In France, the head of the En Marche! party said last week that Russian news channels had targeted the presidential candidate Emmanuel Macron, who belongs to the party and is running on a   Union platform. Richard Ferrand, the party’s   said the campaign’s databases and websites had been hit by “hundreds, if not thousands,” of attacks from inside Russia. The East Stratcom team is the first to admit that it is outgunned: The task is overwhelming, the volume of reports immense, the support to combat them scant. The team tries to debunk bogus items in real time on Facebook and Twitter and publishes daily reports and a weekly newsletter on fake stories to its more than 12, 000 followers on social media. But its list of 2, 500 fake reports is small compared with the daily churn across social media. Catching every fake news story would be nearly impossible, and the fake reports the team does combat routinely get a lot more viewers than its   efforts. East Stratcom is purely a communications exercise. Still, team members, most of whom speak Russian, have received death threats, and a Czech member of the team has twice been accused on Russian television of espionage. The team in Brussels is not the only force in Europe fighting the problem. Similar groups are being created from Finland to the Czech Republic to disprove online hoaxes, state agencies are improving online security to counter potential hacking attacks and European news media outlets are expanding   teams to counter false reports. One of the biggest problems policy makers across Europe say they face is a lack of tech specialists. Germany recently passed a cybersecurity law that called for a rapid response team to combat hacking attacks. Officials quietly acknowledged, though, that they would need three teams, if they could only find people to staff them. “There are concerns shared by many governments that fake news could become weaponized,” said Damian Collins, a British politician in charge of a new parliamentary investigation examining the phenomenon. “The spread of this type of material could eventually undermine our democratic institutions. ” Despite the regionwide push to counter false reports, experts question whether such   efforts by governments and publishers will have a meaningful effect. Fake reports can easily be shared through social media with few, if any, checks for accuracy. “Most people just don’t care about where their news comes from,” said Mark Deuze, a professor at the University of Amsterdam. He added that “nep news,” Dutch for “fake news,” has been growing ahead of the country’s national elections next month. “People are exposed to a ridiculous amount of information online. ” Officials are also anxious about hackers’ attempts to infiltrate the email accounts of candidates and politicians to steal compromising information. Much like their American counterparts, security experts warn, European politicians remain highly vulnerable, though national intelligence agencies are now strengthening lawmakers’ security protocols. In Germany, where Chancellor Angela Merkel is facing tough competition ahead of elections in September, the country’s domestic intelligence service already has reported a sharp rise in   phishing attacks in recent months aimed at political parties and members of the country’s Parliament. They attribute these efforts to the hacking group known as Fancy Bear, or APT 28, which American intelligence agencies linked to the hacking of the Democratic National Committee before the presidential election. Both American and German intelligence officials believe the group is operated by the G. R. U. the Russian military intelligence service. The German government is weighing potential hefty fines for tech giants like Google and Facebook, whose platforms allow false stories to be quickly circulated. The companies insist that they cannot be held responsible because they do not generate the stories.   Maassen, the head of Germany’s domestic intelligence service, said that although there was no “smoking gun,” Russia was likely to be involved in the increase in online misinformation aimed at destabilizing German politics. “What makes cyberattacks so sexy for foreign powers is that it is nearly impossible to find a smoking gun,” Mr. Maassen said in an interview with Phoenix TV Feb. 12. “It is always possible to cover your tracks and operate undercover. ” American tech giants also have stepped in after they were accused of not doing enough to counter false reports on their platforms, accusations that Facebook, Google and other companies deny. They are now funding initiatives in the United States, France and elsewhere to flag fake news online and remove posts if they are found to violate companies’ terms of use or local laws. “This isn’t just about debunking falsehoods,” said Jenni Sargent, the managing director of First Draft News, a nonprofit that is partly funded by Google and expanding rapidly in France ahead of the country’s elections, as well as across Europe and beyond. “What we’re trying to do is to deal with the content as opposed to the source. ” Such efforts across Europe have gained momentum since the United States’ presidential election. Soon after Donald J. Trump’s victory in November, David Alandete gathered his team in the El País newsroom in downtown Madrid with one goal in mind: to respond to fake news. Like many journalists, Mr. Alandete, the Spanish newspaper’s managing editor and a former United States correspondent, had seen waves of false reports during the presidential campaign, many directed at Mexico  —   a country that accounts for roughly half of El País’ online readership. “Trump winning was a major turning point for us,” Mr. Alandete said. “Many of our readers were asking whether they could even travel to the States. ” Populist parties and distrust of traditional news media outlets have been growing in Spain, like other   European countries. Such movements have spurred an explosion of fake or misleading news, aimed at either promoting certain political views or undermining others’ credibility. To counter such reports  —   and, in part, to cater to its Mexican readers  —   El País began expanding its   efforts late last year. That includes assigning five more reporters to debunk false reports online and starting a blog, called “Hechos,” or “facts” in Spanish, to dispel the worst offenders. Not all of El País’s   targets, though, have been about politics. In its first blog post, published last month, the newspaper’s reporters reviewed false claims that the Portuguese soccer star Cristiano Ronaldo had abandoned his sports car after hurting one of his hands while driving. The post, according to Mr. Alandete, was viewed more than 200, 000 times  —   making it one of El País’s   online articles that week. “Many people don’t trust institutions anymore,” Mr. Alandete said. “We see fake news coming from everywhere. ”	1

677	 At a press conference in Eminem’s native Detroit this morning, Eminem made this announcement:“Hey everyone, I’m excited to tell you about a new movie coming up. Working title is “8 Mile 2″ and it will be about my life after I came up and will follow basically my whole career. I’m really looking forward to seeing this movie with y’all and I hope you like it as much as I’ve liked filming it.”Surprisingly, the flick is being directed by none other than Clint Eastwood, a man you don’t normally think of when you think of rap. Eastwood had his own comments about the upcoming film:“This movie was a big challenge for me, not only because of the subject matter, but also because it’s hard to dramatize a man’s entire career like we set out to do. Nevertheless I am very pleased with how things are going and I think we’re really coming up with a multi-dimensional, well rounded story about Eminem’s career, both the bright and the dark parts.” Disclaimer: All stories on this site are satire and the opinions expressed do not belong to any real people.

337	Delfin Polanco waits on Thursday morning for a lawyer to help him stay in the country where he raised his son and has lived for 22 years. Like about 40 others, he arrived by 5 a. m. in Lower Manhattan for a legal clinic offered for immigrants by Catholic Charities. It will be hours before he is seen. To pass the time, Mr. Polanco thumbs through pictures on his phone and cards in his wallet. There he is outside the old Yankee Stadium in 2008, behind two men carrying championship trophies, part of the crew that was moving the team into its new home down the block. Here he is on the Teamsters union card that he got in 1999, which lets him work as a mover. And there is his medical card, listing him as a patient of a clinic at Bellevue Hospital Center, where he goes for treatment of the breathing ailments that he got after working on the cleanup of the World Trade Center site. “Look,” Mr. Polanco says. “I had hair. ” Now he is 47 and not much is left. Mr. Polanco moved to the United States from the Dominican Republic in 1995 when he married an American citizen. Along the way, they divorced. “They stamped ‘deport’ on my work paper seven years ago and tell me to come back every year for the inspection,” he said. More people live in New York City in 2017 than at any time in its history nearly half were born outside the United States. The city’s white population has declined by 3. 5 million since 1950. They have been replaced by immigrants. A tribe of people from all over the world saved the city by moving here and going to work. The Trump family made fortunes in New York, thanks to them. With or without permission to be in the country, immigrants drove pistons in the city and national economy  —   in the service industry, in agriculture, in universities and in   jobs. Inevitably, some large, uncountable number are here without permission. The enforcement of immigration laws depends on a cat’s cradle of rules and policies strung together by successive presidential administrations. Over time, the population of   people in the United States who do not have citizenship, working papers or other visas is thought to have grown to 11 million. Many national Republicans once advocated comprehensive immigration reform, but such views became heresy with the rise of the Tea Party after the 2008 financial crisis. The political stalemate meant the continued growth of a   system that allowed tacit acceptance of people who were   apart from their immigration status. Like, for instance, Mr. Polanco. This week, President Trump’s administration announced plans to enforce the laws aggressively by deporting people who are in the country illegally, regardless of their behavior. Those plans may be limited by the sheer logistics, and in public statements the administration has said it will use its resources to find and deport the most dangerous criminals, which was the practice of the Obama administration. Nevertheless, worries about expanded enforcement are driving throngs to clinics like the one held by Catholic Charities every Thursday in the financial district beginning at 8 a. m. according to Mario Russell, the director of immigrant and refugee services for the archdiocese. Many people were turned away, advised to call a hotline,   . The first people arrived at the clinic this week at 4:30 a. m. to make sure they could see one of the five lawyers and three counselors. Dionne Raymon, 42, a mother of three who was born in Jamaica and has been in the United States for 24 years, was there by 5. “Last week, I couldn’t see anyone because I didn’t get here until 8:30,” Ms. Raymon said. “I had to get the kids out to school. They are off this week. ” Others spoke about boarding subways at 4 a. m. of getting waylaid in the unfamiliar canyons of Lower Manhattan on previous trips. Ms. Raymon said she had never had a minute’s trouble with the police. Studies have shown that immigrants are less likely to commit crimes than people born in the United States. “But to live outside the law, you must be honest,” Bob Dylan wrote. “I’ve never been to jail,” Mr. Polanco said. “Tickets, nothing. ” His son, born in the United States, is about to start college, but is still too young to “claim” his father under kinship citizenship eligibility. Mr. Polanco frets that returning to the Dominican Republic will put medical care for his lung problems beyond his means. “I came here, I was young,” Mr. Polanco said. “Now I am old. Old and sick. ”	1

429	WASHINGTON  —   Congressional Republicans, racked by divisions over health care, taxes and spending, are increasingly desperate for leadership from the White House to unite the party and point the way toward consensus. But presidential leadership does not appear to be forthcoming, leaving the party largely paralyzed at a moment it had thought would be full of legislative activity. “The White House is huge,” said Senator John Thune, Republican of South Dakota. “The president is the only person who can sign a bill into law, so he’s the guy that ultimately holds the whip hand when it comes to this getting done. ” As congressional leaders struggle to clear the first major legislative hurdle of the Trump era  —   a bill to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act  —   their talks with the White House, though not infrequent, have failed to advance any coherent, cohesive policy prescription. Repealing the health care law is the Republicans’ first step toward enacting their broader agenda. So far, President Trump, seeking to project an image of a man of action, has preferred   executive actions over   engagement with Congress. In the absence of presidential leadership, the most fiscally conservative House Republicans have stepped forward to demand that the health care law be whittled to near nothingness. More moderate senators are insisting on a replacement plan with many of the current law’s popular components. Both sides are pressing hard to sway lawmakers working on draft legislation that would roll back the Affordable Care Act’s expansion of Medicaid, replace the subsidies offered in the insurance marketplaces with tax credits to buy coverage, and eliminate tax penalties for people who do not have health insurance. After weeks of loud protests across the country from voters who are fearful of losing their health care, Republican governors complicated matters further this week by joining Democrats in a call for a replacement plan that would ensure coverage for the 20 million Americans who gained insurance under the Affordable Care Act. “I’d like to hear a renewed commitment to repealing the law,” said Senator Mike Lee, Republican of Utah  —   another sign of just how far the party is from unity. Democrats, who have been dismissed as obstructionists by Republicans determined to repeal and replace the law without them, are sitting by quietly waiting for those efforts to fail. At that point, Democrats believe, Republicans will have to reach across the aisle and repair the law. “We’ve maintained all along there is room to negotiate,” said Senator Brian Schatz, Democrat of Hawaii. “But only if they abandon their attempt to repeal the law. ” While he has seen no moves toward cooperation yet, “they are in a world of hurt,” Mr. Schatz said of Republicans, “because none of their plans add up, and their members are starting to figure this out and the public is starting to figure this out, and they don’t have Obama as a foil anymore. I think they need to fail first. ” Senator Claire McCaskill, Democrat of Missouri, who has long offered to help fix the law, said she had heard from only one Republican colleague, Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, since the end of last year. “I don’t think Republicans have decided what they’re waiting for,” she said. “The White House or Godot. ” Many Republicans seem to be resigned to seeking consensus on health care legislation, as well as on a budget and tax reform, without comprehensive White House guidance. Representative Michael McCaul, Republican of Texas and the chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, said he was relying less on a signal from Mr. Trump than on    discussions between lawmakers and the administration to “get the details filled in. ” Those details include how Mr. Trump plans to fund his call for a 10 percent increase in military spending, Mr. McCaul said. “From a budget standpoint, these numbers are difficult to crunch,” he said. “We as Republicans want a stronger national defense. That money’s got to come from someplace. That’s where the hard decisions have to be made. ” Mr. Trump’s aversion to making big changes to two of the costliest government programs, Medicare and Social Security  —   something Republicans generally crave  —   is not helping matters. “That makes it even more difficult,” Mr. McCaul said. The president’s budget outline, unveiled this week, has something for almost every Republican to hate, from the lack of   entitlement reform to large proposed cuts at the State Department. “Speaking for myself,” said Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, “I think the diplomatic portion of the federal budget is very important, and you get results a lot cheaper, frequently, than you do on the defense side. So, speaking for myself, I’m not in favor” of huge reductions at the State Department. Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, called those cuts “dead in the water” for him. Many of Mr. Trump’s direct contributions to the legislative process have happened through the news media, as he has signaled his priorities in interviews that have sometimes left congressional Republicans scrambling to decipher his intentions. Representative Eric Swalwell, Democrat of California, said some of his Republican colleagues were frustrated by their inability to move forward. “They’re reading about what he wants to do at the same time I am in the paper,” he said. Six weeks after Mr. Trump said Republicans would provide a replacement plan for the Affordable Care Act that offered “insurance for everybody,” Speaker Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin is fighting to reconcile his party’s competing priorities while also contending with the occasional messaging complication from the White House. “This is a plan that we are all working on together: the House, the Senate, the White House,” Mr. Ryan said Tuesday. “We’re all working on this together with the administration. ”	1
551	 According to many local observers the ominous news is considered widely as a harbinger of widening rifts within Jordan’s tormented social fabrics as the Arab nation of seven million is equally divided into native Jordanians and descendents of Palestinian refugees whom Queen Rania belonged.Unbeknownst to many Westerners, the King Abdullah of Jordan, a close ally of Obama administration, supports and harbors fanatic Saudi-backed ISIS terrorists and seeks to spread terrorism in the Middle-East region.While Queen Rania showed herself as a typical glamorous Queen, showing more agreeable and democratic façade to her husband’s despotic and repressive regime, but the rumors in Jordan whisper that there was a secret side to Rania’s life, that is least publicized. One thing facts could confirm though, Rania was living a life on the fast lane that is very much Hollywood, and Hollywood indeed, with all that come with that in stark contrast to restricted norms in her country. Dr. Oday al-Shana’a, a London-based former Jordanian court official and ex-friend believes that Bono, the famous Irish singer and so-called philanthropist seduced the innocent Queen. “I am sorry to inform you that due to yet unexpected reasons, Her Majesty the Queen was found dead at her Excelsior Hotel room, 9:00 pm yesterday night . His Majesty expresses his sincere gratitude to the international  outpouring of grief and sorrow over the Queen ‘s death,” Moscow Times cited Mr. Tarawneh on Friday as saying, adding that before her death, the Queen did much to precipitate ending the long-troubled marriage by travelling to Rome to meet a family friend without King’s permission.	0
83	WASHINGTON  —   The Senate confirmed Steven T. Mnuchin, a former Goldman Sachs banker and Hollywood film financier, to be Treasury secretary on Monday, putting in place a key lieutenant to President Trump who will help drive the administration’s plans to overhaul the tax code, renegotiate trade deals around the world and remake financial regulations. By a vote of 53 to 47, the Senate confirmed Mr. Mnuchin, who was Mr. Trump’s top campaign  . During a long debate over Mr. Mnuchin’s credentials, Democrats argued that his experience on Wall Street exemplified corporate malpractice that led to the 2008 financial crisis. The new Treasury secretary will have little time to celebrate. He will be under pressure to help finalize the Trump administration’s tax plan, accelerate the rollback regulations and raise the government’s borrowing limit. The administration has said it will release a comprehensive plan to rewrite the tax code in the coming weeks, and it will have to deal with the debt ceiling next month. While Mr. Mnuchin’s financial acumen has been praised by Mr. Trump and Republicans in Congress, Democrats have argued forcefully that he is not up to the job. They have painted him as a symbol of everything that is wrong with corporate America. “He was part of the cadre of corporate raiders that brought our economy to its knees,” Senator Robert Menendez, Democrat of New Jersey, said on the Senate floor on Monday. There was also no shortage of  . Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, referred to Mr. Mnuchin at the “foreclosure king. ” Senator Tammy Duckworth, Democrat of Illinois, described him as “greedy” and “unethical” while arguing the case against him. “Whether illegally foreclosing on thousands of families, skirting the law with offshore tax havens or helping design tactics that contributed to the 2008 financial crisis, Steve Mnuchin made a career  —   and millions of dollars  —   pioneering increasingly deceptive and predatory ways to rob hardworking Americans of their savings and homes,” Ms. Duckworth said. At a prickly confirmation hearing before the Senate Finance Committee last month, Mr. Mnuchin was scolded by Democrats for failing to disclose nearly $100 million in assets and for not revealing his role as a director of an investment fund based in the Cayman Islands, a   tax haven. After the hearing, Democrats on the committee accused Mr. Mnuchin of lying for saying that OneWest Bank had not engaged in the controversial foreclosure practice of “ ” when he was its chief executive. The Democrats on the committee twice boycotted a vote on his confirmation, leading Republicans to breach protocol and push Mr. Mnuchin’s vote to the full Senate on their own. Just one Democrat, Senator of Joe Manchin III of West Virginia, broke with his party and supported Mr. Mnuchin. In a sign of the backlash that Democrats will face for siding with any part of Mr. Trump’s agenda, the Progressive Change Campaign Committee warned that Mr. Manchin’s vote would not go unnoticed. “We will ensure that Joe Manchin hears from his West Virginia constituents who disapprove of his voting with Wall Street against working families,” the group said in a statement after the vote. For Republicans, the resistance was chalked up to political theater. On Monday, Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah, the Republican chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, accused Democrats of making Mr. Mnuchin a political pawn and described their concerns as a stall tactic. “Under any objective standard, Mr. Mnuchin has ample experience, credentials and qualifications for this important position,” Mr. Hatch said. “My colleagues have done all they can under the rules  —   even to the point of casting aside some longstanding customs and traditions of the Senate  —   in order to delay his confirmation. ” While Mr. Mnuchin struggled to show fluency with some aspects of the job during his confirmation hearing, Republicans and Democrats generally agreed that he was well versed on economic issues. He also struck a more moderate tone than Mr. Trump on issues such as trade and dealing with China. And Mr. Mnuchin left some experts dumbfounded after suggesting that “there would be no absolute tax cut for the upper class”  —   a promise that appears to be at odds with plans presented by Mr. Trump and House Republicans. Mr. Mnuchin was not the only member of Mr. Trump’s cabinet to be confirmed on Monday night. The Senate also voted in favor of David Shulkin to lead the Department of Veterans Affairs. A holdover from the Obama administration, Dr. Shulkin is currently the department’s under secretary of health and was approved by a unanimous vote. Mr. Mnuchin was the latest member of Mr. Trump’s cabinet to edge through the confirmation process on a largely   vote. Last week, Tom Price was approved as secretary of health and human services and Betsy DeVos narrowly won confirmation to lead the Education Department. Things could become more complicated on Thursday, however, when Andrew Puzder, Mr. Trump’s choice for labor secretary, faces a committee hearing. Several Republicans on the committee have declined to support Mr. Puzder, a   chain executive who critics say promotes policies that are harmful to workers.	1

221	The Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. often described poverty and prejudice as related enemies, and in the last few months of his life, he called publicly for a national demonstration by the poor that would “confront the power structure massively. ” The Poor People’s Campaign was an effort to do precisely that, not with just a march but with an extended occupation of the National Mall in Washington. Organized by Dr. King and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference  —   and led by Ralph Abernathy after Dr. King’s assassination  —   the campaign brought around 3, 000 people from all over the country to a spit of land that would soon be drenched by rains, and filled with wooden shanties and varied attempts at utopian    collectivism. They called it Resurrection City. It was an urban area taking up 15 acres near the mall’s Reflecting Pool. The first demonstrators arrived on May 12, 1968, on buses from Mississippi. An architect designed rudimentary tents and wooden structures for temporary residents, and then came a city hall, a general store, a health clinic and a handful of celebrity visitors, including Sidney Poitier, Marlon Brando and Barbra Streisand. The New York Times assigned Faith Berry, an   author, to visit the camp near the end of its   run. George Tames, a staff photographer in Washington, took hundreds of photos there. A handful of them ran with Ms. Berry’s article, which explored the camp’s struggle to cohere as an ad hoc society of people of different races with varied demands and overwhelming needs. The published photos generally captured the messy end of the camp. Resurrection City’s failures  —   from illness to theft and racial conflict  —   dominated the coverage of the time. Calvin Trillin captured it best when he wrote in The New Yorker that June: “The poor in Resurrection City have come to Washington to show that the poor in America are sick, dirty, disorganized and powerless  —   and they are criticized daily for being sick, dirty, disorganized and powerless. ” The images shown here present an alternative, and more   portrait. First, there is an image showing one of the camp’s many speakers. The camp’s public address system was used to announce everything from campsite meetings and emergencies to   phone calls, but it was also where Abernathy and others sought to rally residents, and remind them of the cause. The other images show life in the camp at its most calm, humane and mundane  —   two women chatting inside a tent a bit of barbering, a bit of (free) health care and some of the homes and homemade messages intended to define the camp on its own terms. These photographs, never published until now, show neither simple success, nor failure. They are less pretty than powerful, as a testament to idealism and its challenges  —   evidence of our continual urge to gather and make demands on Washington, wherever and whenever needed.	1
366	Not long into a raucous,     set she performed on Thursday night at Carolines on Broadway, Leslie Jones described the experience of having to explain to an elderly aunt why there were pictures of Ms. Jones’s naked body on her computer screen. The awkward conversation followed an episode from last summer, when, amid a series of online abuses that Ms. Jones suffered, her personal website was hacked and explicit images of her were posted there. “Now I got to explain this to my aunties,” said Ms. Jones, 49, a cast member from “Saturday Night Live. ” “They old, and they from civil rights. They just now getting computers. ” Slipping into the quavering voice of one of these relatives, Ms. Jones said, “She was like, ‘Was it the Klu’s Klux Klan? ’” She examined her niece’s anatomy and added, “I didn’t raise you like that. ” Ms. Jones said she answered: “Just go back to sleep, auntie. Don’t turn the computer on. ” For Ms. Jones, this set  —   the first of six she is scheduled to play at Carolines this weekend  —   seemed to cap an exuberant reassertion of her comic self (on “S. N. L. ,” at the Emmys, on Twitter) after she was the target of vicious internet attacks. Most of her   focused on drawing distinctions between the person she seems to be on television and the person she is in real life. At Carolines, Ms. Jones was louder, more playfully confrontational, even more openly libidinous and less easily embarrassed than any character she plays on “S. N. L. ” (On more than one occasion, she told the crowd, “I’m a horrible person. ”) And when she did talk about the internet harassment, Ms. Jones showed that she could still find   humor in some devastating personal circumstances. When the nude photos of her were posted online, she said, “I actually laughed. ” “I was like, they don’t understand how many people I’ve actually tried to show that to,” she added. “You really just helped a sister out. Thank you for the distribution. ” Last summer, after the release of a new “Ghostbusters” movie that   Ms. Jones with a predominantly female cast, she was bombarded on Twitter with racist and sexist insults. At one point, she wrote that she was “in a personal hell” and was stepping away from her Twitter account. Shortly after, Twitter banned Milo Yiannopoulos, the inflammatory   commentator who had been a ringleader of those attacks. The hacking of Ms. Jones’s website occurred a few weeks later, but she gradually returned to the spotlight, addressing the indignities in her barnstorming and unabashed comedy. At the Emmy Awards in September, she appeared onstage with the Ernst  Young accountants who tabulate its votes to jokingly ask for their help in protecting her online. “Y’all over here using your skills to protect best   in a French sitcom,” she said at the time. “Meanwhile, I’m   on CNN. ” In a “Saturday Night Live” monologue in October, Ms. Jones said she had not been embarrassed by the trolling or the hacking, and she taunted her internet assailants. “I am very comfortable with who I am,” she said. “I am an open book. I keep my porn in a folder labeled ‘porn. ’” This week, as Mr. Yiannopoulos, her onetime antagonist, lost a book deal and a prominent speaking gig and resigned from Breitbart News amid the furor over a past interview in which he condoned pedophilia, Ms. Jones did not gloat too much. Without mentioning Mr. Yiannopoulos by name, she wrote on her Twitter account that people were devoting too much energy to his woes. “Been done and moved on,” she wrote. “He has no space here!” In her   set, Ms. Jones urged her female audience members not to be defined by how men perceive them  —   “Own your craziness,” she told them  —   and said there was no undoing the freedoms they had won. “All women are like me now,” she said. “We make our own money. ” Wondering aloud if she would ever find true love, Ms. Jones drew connections between her single status and the political era of President Trump. “I want to be in love,” she said. “I want to do that, but it’s 2017, and we got a pig in office. The world is about to end. ” But liberals, too, could be misguided, she suggested. “If I see another    white woman from Williamsburg saying ‘black lives matter,’ I’m going to punch you in the mouth,” Ms. Jones said. “Stop doing that. ” When she observes these political protests, Ms. Jones said: “Not one black woman out there. Black woman at home watching ‘Housewives of Atlanta. ’” During a riff about rescue dogs and   pet owners who say things like “Did I rescue the dog, or did the dog rescue me?” Ms. Jones spun a wicked fantasy. “How about both of y’all get caught in a fire, and neither one of y’all get rescued?” she said. Without waiting for the laughter of her aghast crowd to subside, Ms. Jones invoked her mantra from earlier in the night. “I told you, I am horrible,” she said.	1

775	 In a final speech to the synod, Pope Francis endorsed Senator Bernie Sanders for President of the United States, while taking some clear swipes at conservatives who hold up church doctrine above all else, and use it to cast judgment on others.“The synod experience also made us better realize that the true defenders are not those who uphold its letter, but its spirit; not ideas but people; not formulas but free availability of God’s love and forgiveness,” Pope Francis said. “I see in Senator Bernard Sanders a man of great integrity and moral conviction, who understands these principles and genuinely wants what’s best for all people.”	0
358	On Wednesday, President Trump rescinded protections for transgender students that had allowed them to use bathrooms according to their gender identity, an issue that has roiled recent political discourse. Earlier in the week, one vigilant reader pointed out language that he felt needlessly distinguished between biologically born women and transgender women. The line came in a column on the resistance discussions to Trump’s agenda that are taking place over dinners in private homes. The public editor’s take: The reader has a good point. I’m not sure this was a distinction worth making in the first place. Over the weekend and into Monday, letters came in referring to another topic at the forefront of the new White House’s agenda lately  —   illegal immigration. Several readers found headlines misleading in their descriptions of a new Trump proposal. The public editor’s take:  The head of the copy desk, Jill Taylor, agrees with the reader that “illegal” would have made for a clearer headline, though she pointed out that, for space reasons, the desk took a calculated risk that readers who’ve been paying at least a little attention would not equate “immigrants” with all immigrants. Two reactions from me. First, I sympathize, as always, with the dilemma of the copy editor trying to fit “undocumented immigrants” into a headline. But making the choice to lose the qualifier distorts the meaning. Headlines that refer only to “immigrants” makes it sound like a World War    . Deporting immigrants who are undocumented, and thus here illegally, is a much smaller subset of all immigrants, and aggressive deportation of this group has been pursued in past administrations too. Plus, with the occasional confusion that some White House directives are producing, clarity on what in fact is happening becomes all the more crucial. Readers also took issue this week with another headline, this one on a story about the sentencing of an Israeli soldier who killed an unconscious Palestinian attacker. Specifically, readers were upset that the print headline didn’t note the Palestinian had been the initial aggressor when he carried out a stabbing attack at an Israeli checkpoint in March before being killed. The print headline read: “Israeli Soldier Who Killed Wounded Palestinian Gets 18 Months. ” The digital headline, on the other hand, read: “Elor Azaria, Israeli Soldier Who Killed Wounded Assailant, Gets 18 Months in Prison. ” The public editor’s take: It can often be difficult to sort through the competing claims of biased reporting in coverage of the Middle East, with views so hardened on both sides and emotions running high. This headline, however, does seem to miss the mark by failing to signal a core element of the story.  Headlines were the hot topic of the week: Another one that stoked the anger of readers was on the home page, and pointed to a story about Milo Yiannopoulos’s fall. The headline read: “Star of the   Backs   Sex, and Is Shunned. ” We asked Michael Owen, editor of the news desk, for his view. The public editor’s take: I have in fact written about this issue before, including a headline on a story about a Montana judge who sentenced a man to two months in prison for raping his preteen daughter. The Times headline at one point referred to him as having sex with his daughter. In this case, I appreciate what the editors were thinking in addressing the headline  —   that they were trying to capture Yiannopoulos’s perspective. But the headline speaks from the voice of The Times, and, as written, it swaps the language of assault for the language of sex. Before Trump appointed Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster as his new national security adviser, The Times ran a story on a possible choice who turned down the job. The article concluded with a sentence about another contender for the post, the former general and director of the C. I. A. David Petraeus. The line stood out to several readers: “Mr. Petraeus resigned from the C. I. A. in 2012 after admitting that he had an extramarital affair. ” The public editor’s take: Here’s a case of applying a little too much haste in describing Petraeus’s checkered past. An editor I spoke with agreed. Obviously, in the case of the fallen general, it would have been more accurate to attribute his ouster to his mishandling of classified material.  Returning to our hot topic of the week, it may have taken the military backgrounds of the men in line for the national security adviser position  —   or simply rabid fandom of “Apocalypse Now” and its Wagner helicopter scene  —   to have spotted the issue with the following headline: “New Slopes in South Korea. ” The public editor’s take: I’m guessing not too many editors have served, though in this case it seemed obvious that the reference was to the ski slope picture above the headline.  Far away from Korea, in the Bensonhurst neighborhood of Brooklyn, Uzbeks of Korean descent run a restaurant that The Times recently reviewed. The review ran with a slide show, and one of the photos was removed after readers commented. We went to the editor of the review, Patrick Farrell, for an explanation.

667	 Just two days after the funeral for the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, who died last week of a heart attack at the age of 79, President Obama signed Executive Order 14651, which appoints Rashad Hussain as the new Supreme Court Justice to replace Scalia.“We cannot wait for a new President or the Senate Republicans to fill this vacancy left by Scalia, so I have taken it upon myself to do what needed to be done,” Obama told reporters at a press conference today. “Republican Senators believe that it is appropriate not to act on such an important matter, and as I have shown today, I do not agree with that.” If you are reading this, then you were stupid enough to fall for one of my lame, unfunny fake news stories. You have also contributed to my saving up enough money for my dream trip to Walt Disney World. Think about that every time you see Mickey Mouse from now on, dumbshit.	0
661	 The Republican frontrunner Donald Trump, has confessed to a room full of university students in Georgia, that his “very first act” as President will be renaming New Mexico. The revelation came during a Q&A at Valdosta State University, where Trump was campaigning.Eyewitnesses say that around the midpoint of the forum, a first year psychology student began a question directed at Trump, by identifying herself as New Mexican. The U.S. presidential candidate immediately rolled his eyes and interrupted the young woman. “Oh we’re definitely changing that,” he said. “No please, continue. But when I get in there, New Mexico is gone.”When asked to elaborate by the moderator, Trump opened up, revealing what his “first act” as President of the United States “will” be. “I mean come on, New Mexico? Are they really serious? My first day in office, I’m changing that name so fast, it’ll blow their sombreros straight off.”The 19 year old student looked stunned, and asked why Trump would want to rename her home state. “Listen sweetie, I’m here to make America great again, not Mexico. Alright?” the billionaire responded sarcastically. “They’ve got a real problem in that state with illegals, drugs and crime, and don’t even get me started on the rapists.” Fail Much News was founded in 2015 and is a satire, parody and spoof news site.

517	 It’s pretty sad to look around and see how police officers are being treated right now. They put their lives on the line every single day to defend our freedoms within the local community. We are more than thankful for our military, yet we fail to recognize the very people that keep us safe in our homes at night.Police officers don’t get paid a lot either. They knowingly walk into possible gunfights almost every day. They do it because they heard the call to serve. They do it because they are true American patriots.Well, there was just another case of disrespect against cops. In Alabama, last week a cashier decided that she didn’t want to serve the cops.Maria Englesia pictured above told the officers to “get out of here” because they “didn’t serve pigs.” This was blatant.McDonalds stepped in as soon as they heard what happened. They immediately fired the woman and issued a formal apology to the police department of Alabama.	0
679	 This week, a scientific research facility in Wyoming made a startling discovery that is certain to change the way millions of Americans look at the environmentalism movement, after they found conclusive evidence that solar panels not only convert the sun’s energy into usable energy, but that they are also draining the sun of its own energy, possibly with catastrophic consequences far worse than global warming.Scientists at the Wyoming Institute of Technology, a privately-owned think tank located in Cheyenne, Wyoming, discovered that energy radiated from the sun isn’t merely captured in solar panels, but that energy is directly physically drawn from the sun by those panels, in a process they refer to as “forced photovoltaic drainage.” Solar panels are not like a vacuum cleaner — they can’t physically suck out the Sun’s energy. The Sun consistently emits solar radiation, regardless of whether we use it or not. It isn’t a feedback system whereby our actions can alter the amount released. It’s a system that we tap into for our benefit; we have no influence over it.	0

You can’t beat it. And it serves the most delicious tacos,” Trump told reporters. “Highly recommended for journalists when they go to cover the denuclearization of North Korea!”Kim, who was standing next to Trump, said nothing and smiled.The new franchise was rapidly constructed inside the existing Ryugyong Hotel, a massive 1,000-foot tall glass pyramid that sits in the heart of Pyongyang. The hotel was empty until recently, although it has been under construction for more than thirty years.

363	They drag their luggage, carry their young children in their arms and join hands to help one another over rough terrain and along snowy roads. They are immigrants, refugees and asylum seekers who are streaming across the border from the United States into Canada in higher numbers. For those who cross illegally, handcuffs await. They are detained, interviewed by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and turned over to the Canadian border agency. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police said last week that there had been a significant increase over the past few months in the number of people illegally crossing the border, mostly in Quebec, Manitoba and British Columbia. The police did not provide figures, but they said the largest uptick was recorded in Quebec. In the last week alone, images of families and solo travelers from countries like Sudan and Turkey have emerged as they encounter police officers, politely waiting, at a crossing in Hemmingford, Quebec. Cpl. François Gagnon, a spokesman for the Mounted Police, said that the authorities started noticing an increase in the last few months of 2016 for reasons that were “not clear cut” but that might be related to the election of Donald J. Trump and his executive order on immigration in January. “It might be one of the reasons,” he said. The order, targeting immigrants from seven   countries and indefinitely suspending refugees from Syria, was blocked by various courts. On Friday, President Trump said a new executive action would be issued soon. Corporal Gagnon said that as soon as the   asylum seekers cross the border, they are advised that they would be arrested. “It is a criminal activity to cross the border illegally,” he said. “It is the same as when I arrest a drunk driver on the road. We are going to do it for security purposes. ” He added: “The basic process for the R. C. M. P. is to handcuff everybody, based on the fact that it is criminal. Based on risk assessment, we are not going to handcuff women and children. This is a new humanitarian thing for us, as well. Those people have been through a lot and we don’t want to put more pressure on them. ” Once they are in custody, the migrants and asylum seekers are taken to police stations, where the handcuffs are usually removed and they are asked about their identification and country of origin. An investigation is conducted into whether they are in a Canadian intelligence database or wanted for a crime, Corporal Gagnon said. “If nothing pops up, they are going to be turned over to the Canadian Border Services Agency and then they apply for asylum,” he said. There are no criminal charges once they establish a demand for asylum, but they could be fined, he added. The New York Times has been tracking the effect on Canada of Mr. Trump’s executive order on immigration. In January, as the order stranded people at airports, upended immigration plans   and provoked global condemnation, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada took to social media to restate the country’s   policy.  “To those fleeing persecution, terror  war, Canadians will welcome you, regardless of your faith,” Mr. Trudeau wrote on Twitter. “Diversity is our strength. ” The Quebec crossing is the most active, Corporal Gagnon said. This month, a Times report noted that over the last couple of years, a small number of people had been crossing the border at Manitoba from the United States and then filing for asylum. But as the atmosphere of fear and uncertainty grows as immigrants fear arrest on “any corner” in the United States, refugee workers in Winnipeg say there has been a noticeable surge in border crossings.	1
695	 On Tuesday, Sheriff Joe Arpaio officially endorsed Donald Trump for president. Early this morning, Trump shocked the country by announcing Arpaio as his pick for Vice Presidential running mate in 2016.“I have great respect for Joe Arpaio,” Trump told reporters. “Like me, he understands that we must restore law and order to the border and respect the men and women of our police forces. I thank him for his support of my policies and candidacy for President. He too knows that we can make America great again, and because of this, I am proud to announce Joe Arpaio as my Vice Presidential running mate. And just moments ago, I’m happy to report that Arpaio has accepted my offer. So it’s now official; you will see a Trump-Arpaio ticket come this November.” “Everything I believe in he’s doing and he’s going to do it when he becomes president,” Arpaio told reporters shortly after addressing hundreds of Trump supporters waiting in a high school gymnasium here. “I met Donald six months ago in Phoenix, introduced him then, 30 days back in Phoenix, introduced him then. It is my privilege and honor to help him, to endorse him today for president of the United States.”	0
471	The world is coming to an end, and they’re all singing “Jingle Bells. ” That may not be your idea of a great musical selection for Armageddon. But as performed by a ragtag chorus of displaced persons in Theater for a New Audience’s spirited revival of Thornton Wilder’s “The Skin of Our Teeth,” the choice of song feels fitting, resourceful, valiant and  —   for just those reasons  —   very moving. The scene comes near the end of the first act of this wobbly mammoth of a play, which opened on Tuesday night at the Polonsky Shakespeare Center in Brooklyn. And as often happens in the director Arin Arbus’s heartfelt interpretation of Wilder’s 1942 cosmic comedy, the sequence’s elements register as both exceedingly whimsical and disturbingly familiar. What’s being portrayed, after all, is an earth succumbing to climate change, which means that although it is high summer, a glacier is advancing on Excelsior, N. J. where a home has become a haven for a swarm of refugees, whose admittance was a subject of angry argument among the family that lives there. And what may be the last fire on the planet is about to go out. It is hardly a cause for celebration that the alarm bells being rung here sound as resonant today as they must have in the early 1940s, when the United States was on the brink of world war. Yet a celebratory glow pervades this   portrait of a single family’s survival against the odds through freeze, famine and war. “The Skin of Our Teeth” can be quaint, creaky and tedious. But it feels as perversely suitable to 2017 as “Jingle Bells” does to the Ice Age. When the play first opened, with a dazzling cast led by Fredric March and Tallulah Bankhead, Brooks Atkinson wrote in The New York Times that it stood “head and shoulders above the monotonous plane of our moribund theater. ” Atkinson particularly admired Wilder’s “mischievous ideas about the informality of good theater. ” But while he adored the first third of “Skin,” he was less enamored of the two other acts. He wasn’t wrong. That first act, which places a    American family on the edge of extinction in the Ice Age, still feels as fresh as morning and as old as Moses (who happens to appear in it). But as it continues to follow the allegorical Antrobus clan in its   struggle for survival (through a   flood on the boardwalks of Atlantic City and a   world war) “Skin” can wear thin. Recent revivals  —   including a misguided whopper in Central Park in 1998, starring John Goodman  —   have suggested that the play had gone the way of its singing dinosaurs. Wilder’s starker “Our Town” and robust “The Matchmaker” (the basis for the musical “Hello, Dolly! ”) seemed far more likely candidates for survival. Ms. Arbus  —   whose fruitful association with Theater for a New Audience has yielded a bright string of cleareyed productions of classics  —   doesn’t entirely restore “Skin” to newborn sprightliness. But she makes you appreciate why its first audiences cherished it. Her production does particularly well by Wilder’s inspired notion to have the improvisatory spirit of “theater, interrupted” reflect the   persistence of life itself. From its first moments (and it’s all in the script) the production is troubled by falling scenery, electrical blackouts and a temperamental actress who refuses to stay in character. That’s the woman who plays Sabina, the Antrobus’s mantrap of a maid, embodied with original comic flair by Mary Wiseman, who brings to mind not so much Ms. Bankhead (who created the part) as a young Lucille Ball with an attitude. It is Sabina who guides us  —   irascibly and apologetically  —   through the willful anachronisms of the play. Its central archetypal clan is made up of Mr. and Mrs. Antrobus (David Rasche and Kecia Lewis) and their children Gladys (Kimber Monroe) and Henry (Reynaldo Piniella) who was originally named Cain. Mr. Antrobus is an inventor of genius (his contributions include the wheel, the lever and the alphabet) while his wife is a fierce defender of family. As for Sabina, she’s basically Lilith, the eternal temptress, there to lead good men like Mr. Antrobus astray. In its sexual politics (and its Oedipal confrontations) “Skin” can feel agonizingly dated. And despite solid performances by Mr. Rasche and Ms. Lewis, the configuring of this eternal triangle occupies entirely too much stage time. It’s as a   production that this “Skin” captures, tickles and distresses the imagination. Ms. Arbus has enlisted a crackerjack production team  —   including Riccardo Hernandez (sets) and Cait O’Connor (the commedia dell’  costumes and puppets)  —   and a diverse cast of nearly three dozen (including a fierce Mary Lou Rosato as a boardwalk soothsayer) to fill Wilder’s   canvas. The production deploys them with wit and efficiency, while retaining an endearing air of ramshackle spontaneity. The script has updated its anachronisms (Trader Joe’s instead of A  P) and features some stirring contemporary songs by César Alvarez about the search for home. “So many years I have been dreaming, dreaming, dreaming of a place to call my own,” the refugees sing, toward the first act’s end. By that point, it’s looking as if they may all freeze to death. So when Ms. Wiseman steps out of character to ask the audience to bring its chairs to the stage to stoke the fire, there’s no question that were we able to oblige, we would. At such moments, “Skin” becomes a welcome pep rally for a world that could use some reassurance that it will, despite everything, carry on.	1
167	UNITED NATIONS  —     hours after President Trump swatted away at a broad international consensus on how to achieve peace between Israelis and Palestinians, his United Nations envoy sought to assure the world on Thursday that his administration supports Palestinian statehood but wants a “thinking out of the box” approach. “We absolutely support a   solution,” the American ambassador, Nikki R. Haley, said in answer to a question after a United Nations Security Council meeting devoted to the   conflict. “But we are thinking out of the box as well, which is  —   what does it take to bring these two sides to the table, what do we need to have them agree on?” she said. She said nothing about what that approach would be, nor did she go any further in revealing a coherent picture of United States policy on the conflict, one of the most intractable in the world. The day before, Mr. Trump hinted at a new regional effort aimed at bringing the two sides together, but he said he would not insist on the creation of a Palestinian state. “I’m looking at   and ” he said. “I like the one that both parties like. ” Both Ms. Haley’s and Mr. Trump’s remarks were in sharp contrast with warnings from other diplomats, including the United Nations envoy entrusted to help the two sides find a path out of their long, bitter conflict. “The   solution remains the only way to achieve the legitimate national aspirations of both peoples,” the envoy, Nickolay E. Mladenov, told the Security Council earlier in the day. “Israel can take the necessary step to stop settlement expansion and construction in order to preserve this prospect, while the Palestinian leadership can demonstrate their commitment to tackling the challenges of violence and incitement on their side,” Mr. Mladenov said. Speaking in Egypt the day before, Mr. Mladenov’s boss, the United Nations secretary general, António Guterres, said, “There is no Plan B to the situation between Palestinians and Israelis but a   solution. ” The Swedish ambassador, Olof Skoog, told reporters on his way into the Security Council meeting on Thursday, “It’s very dangerous to move away from the   solution idea, especially before you have something viable as an alternative. ” France’s ambassador, François Delattre, said the risks were too high. “Should the prospect of a   solution disappear as a mirage in the desert, then that would be an open door to more extremism and more terrorism,” he said. Ms. Haley, who has been on the job for less than a month, used her remarks to the news media mostly to harshly criticize the United Nations as a whole for what she called its “  bias. ” Palestinians have accused the Trump administration of the opposite. The United States objected last Friday to the appointment of a former Palestinian prime minister, Salam Fayyad, as the secretary general’s envoy to Libya. The Palestinian ambassador, Riyad Mansour, said on Thursday that Mr. Fayyad had been rejected “simply because he was a Palestinian. ” Ms. Haley also suggested that it was unnecessary and counterproductive for the United Nations Security Council to hold monthly meetings on the   conflict  —   or in her words, “obsess over Israel. ” In fact, the Council has three meetings on Syria every month, one on Yemen as well as regular briefings on every United Nations mission, from Afghanistan to South Sudan, plus briefings on the impact of Security Council sanctions on countries such as North Korea and Iran.	1
33	Over the past week there has been an escalating feud between the executive and judicial branches of the U. S. government. When a Federal District Court judge in Seattle, James Robart, blocked President Trump’s travel ban, Trump went on the attack, calling Robart a “  judge,” the ruling “ridiculous” and the courts “so political. ” Even “a bad high school student would understand” why his ban should stay in place, the president said. Trump’s own nominee to the Supreme Court called the president’s comments “demoralizing” and “disheartening. ” When one story on the deepening drama ran on the home page, a reader noticed that its home page headline referred to the executive branch merely as the “U. S. ” The story’s digital headline read: “Justice Department Urges Appeals Court to Reinstate Trump’s Travel Ban,” while the home page version was: “U. S. Urges Court to Revive Ban Hearing Set for Tuesday. ” The public editor’s take: That’s a good catch. I’m sympathetic to headline writers, who are constricted by space limitations as they try to convey ideas clearly and accurately. And in most usage, referring to the executive branch U. S. is appropriate. In this case, it’s misleading. Trump also continued his onslaught of the news media, claiming that it plays down coverage of terrorist attacks. The White House even released a list of 78 attacks it claimed the media undercovered. Several readers wrote in to ask The Times to push back, which the paper did, publishing a compilation of the attacks that the paper has covered thoroughly. It did so, however, to the chagrin of some other readers. The public editor’s take: I am in full agreement. Playing defense is not the position The Times wants to find itself in  —   not over frivolous charges, anyway. If Trump or his administration challenges the thrust of a story based on anonymous sources, The Times has an obligation to explain itself to readers. Otherwise, taking such bait is just a distraction. Trump also targeted The Times specifically this week through his favorite medium, Twitter. This prompted several readers to ask whether The Times could take legal recourse against the president. The public editor’s take: I went out looking for answers from a pair of knowledgeable legal hands, and here’s what I found: The president has broad immunity from civil claims arising from the performance of his official duties. There is a convoluted legal argument over how broad. The matter of whether a judge would classify “tweeting” as an official duty remains untested. I’m guessing no lawsuit from The Times is coming anytime soon. Nor should there be one, in my view. That would be a waste of resources and would cast the news organization in opposition to the president. Its job is to cover him, fairly and aggressively. A line in a column about Kirsten Gillibrand and the   left raised the eyebrows of a couple readers for its perceived sexism. The public editor’s take: Hmmm. I’m alert to coverage with sexist overtones and I’ll be writing more in the future  —   so keep those letters coming. In this case, my antenna didn’t go off. I took Ginia Bellafante’s pudding reference as the wry commentary of a columnist  —   a category of journalist that enjoys more leeway. Several readers this week also took issue with The Times’s explanation for the rating of the film “Sophie and the Rising Sun”: “Rated R for interracial sexy time. ” We took this question to Stephanie Goodman, the film editor, for an explanation. The public editor’s take: A little levity in movie ratings? Seems like a little   fun to me. Finally, a lifelong reader of The Times passed away recently, and his granddaughter wrote in to tell us how much he appreciated the paper till his final day. Perhaps some reading indoors, in memory of Shanahan’s grandfather, would help those of us in the Northeast brave the snow. Updated 11:00 a. m. February 10, to include Trump’s latest attack on The Times, earlier Friday morning.	1
523	 Peterborough, Ontario (CBC) — With the investigation still unfolding, much is unclear about deadly Peterborough shooting.The police were not able to track down suspects, said officer Nicole Wilson.One of the eyewitnesses, brother of the deceased, told reporters: “I have no idea why they would do something like this. I have absolutely no idea. I am in shock myself.” He said he last talked to his brother 2 hours ago.Police tells CBC that one of the guns used in the shootings was legally purchased and traces back to someone believe to be connect with the shootings. The police would not disclose the name of the purchaser.One of the suspects involved in the Peterborough shootings has been identified but the name is undisclosed. He abruptly left the crime scene after the shootings.The sources said one of the residences in Peterborough, surrounded by law enforcement is connected to the suspect. It is that house where the chase began that led to the shootout with the occupants of the SUV.	0
472	In perhaps the clearest signal yet that the era of the solo celebrity architect is behind us, three friends who hung out a shingle in their Catalonian hometown, Olot, Spain, 30 years ago and never left or parted ways have won their profession’s highest honor: the Pritzker Prize. Rafael Aranda, Carme Pigem and Ramon Vilalta on Wednesday became the first team of three to be selected for the prize, which will be awarded in Tokyo on May 20. “Their intensely collaborative way of working together, where the creative process, commitment to vision and all responsibilities are shared equally, led to the selection of the three individuals for this year’s award,” Thomas J. Pritzker, the chairman of Hyatt Foundation, which sponsors the award, said in a statement, adding, “Mr. Aranda, Ms. Pigem and Mr. Vilalta have had an impact on the discipline far beyond their immediate area. ” Ms. Pigem, who spoke for the group because her English is strongest, said in a telephone interview that the collaboration was integral to the practice. “For us, it’s very important to work together  —   one of the most important things we talk about is shared creativity,” she said. “It’s not a question of one person it’s all three. Sometimes we say six hands, one voice. ” The architects are not widely known they have not designed major public projects or worked much outside Spain. But they came to the attention of the Pritzker jury because their works, if modest, “admirably and poetically fulfill the traditional requirements of architecture for physical and spatial beauty along with function and craftsmanship,” the citation said. “But what sets them apart is their approach that creates buildings and places that are both local and universal at the same time. ” The team’s buildings include the Soulages Museum, in Rodez, France, featuring boldly modern metallic architecture (in collaboration with G. Trégouët, 2014) and a   complex in Barcelona, Spain (Sant Antoni  —   Joan Oliver, 2007) that incorporates a library, a center for the elderly and a children’s playground. The design features ample views of interior gardens and sky, and metal corridors that nod to the site’s industrial past as a candy factory. They also continue to work on projects in their Catalonian home turf, like the   athletics track, completed in 2000, and the covered   Les Cols restaurant in 2011, with plastic walls of trees, between which real trees grow. In 1988, one year after completing their studies in architecture at the School of Architecture in Vallès, the three won first prize in a competition sponsored by the Spanish Ministry of Public Works and Urbanism, to design a lighthouse in Punta Aldea. “We said, O. K.,” Ms. Pigem said. “Maybe we can do something good in architecture. ” They founded their firm that year, calling it RCR Arquitectes, after the initials of their first names. For the lighthouse, they had pondered “the essence of the typology,” according to their Pritzker biography. The team members have brought a   sensibility to their built projects, as well as their work as consultant architects to the natural park in the volcanic zone of La Garrotxa. “For us, what is very, very important is the relationship to the site,” Ms. Pigem said. “If the site is natural, or if the site is a building, or if the site is a city. What is important is to study the strong and unique relationship between the existing and the new. ” In 2007, they converted an    foundry into their office, Barberí Laboratory. They are the second Pritzker laureates to come from Spain Rafael Moneo received the award in 1996. Ms. Pigem, who is married to Mr. Vilalta, said she and her colleagues “feel very excited and very joyful. ” The Pritzker jury said it was important to reward a local firm in an increasingly globalized world. “More and more people fear that because of this international influence,” the citation said, “we will lose our local values, our local art and our local customs. ” “They help us to see, in a most beautiful and poetic way, that the answer to the question is not ‘ ’ and that we can, at least in architecture, aspire to have both,” it continued, “our roots firmly in place and our arms outstretched to the rest of the world. ”	1
398	Joseph A. Wapner, a California judge who became a widely recognized symbol of tough but   American jurisprudence during the 12 years he sat on the bench of the syndicated television show “The People’s Court,” died on Sunday at his home in Los Angeles. He was 97. His son David confirmed the death, The Associated Press said. Judge Wapner had served for 20 years on the California Municipal and Superior Courts before becoming the occasionally irascible, highly watchable star of “The People’s Court,” a daytime series on which   plaintiffs and defendants from California small claims courts would argue their cases before him. A decorated veteran of World War II, Judge Wapner ran his television courtroom from the show’s debut in 1981 to the end of its original run in 1993 with stern, mesmerizing discipline, cutting off onscreen complainants who displeased him and threatening to levy unspecified penalties on those who dared to interrupt him. But Judge Wapner’s reasoned verdicts, in disputes over missing pets, encroaching fences or botched hairdos, were difficult to argue with. And his evenhanded hearings of cases in which mere pocket change was at stake let millions of viewers know that no matter how seemingly insignificant their legal disputes, they, too, were entitled to their day in court. “People think I’m kind and considerate, and that I listen and evaluate, and give each party a chance to talk,” Judge Wapner said in an interview just as “The People’s Court” was becoming a nationwide hit. “The public’s perception of judges seems to be improving because of what I’m doing, and that makes me happy. ” Born on Nov. 15, 1919, in Los Angeles, Joseph Albert Wapner graduated in 1937 from Hollywood High School, where he briefly dated the future film actress Lana Turner, and in 1941 from the University of Southern California, where he received a bachelor’s degree in philosophy. During World War II, he served with the Army in the Pacific and was wounded by sniper fire on Cebu Island in the Philippines, leaving him with shrapnel in his left foot. He received the Purple Heart and the Bronze Star for his bravery and was honorably discharged in 1945. After earning his law degree from the University of Southern California in 1948, Judge Wapner worked in private practice as a lawyer for nearly a decade, until Gov. Edmund G. Brown of California appointed him to a judgeship in Los Angeles municipal court in 1959. Two years later, Judge Wapner was elected presiding judge of the city’s vast Superior Court system, in which he supervised some 200 fellow judges. “I was the only Jew who’d ever been elected,” he said in a 1982 interview, “and I don’t know when there’ll be another. ” Of the numerous cases Judge Wapner heard before his retirement from the bench in 1979, perhaps the most notorious was the divorce trial of the California sports tycoon Jack Kent Cooke and his first wife, Jeannie Carnegie. The $49 million settlement that Ms. Carnegie ultimately received would earn an entry in the Guinness Book of World Records. But the full measure of Judge Wapner’s celebrity was not realized until 1981, when he was approached by the television producer Ralph Edwards, the creator of “Truth or Consequences” and “This Is Your Life,” to officiate on a new show, loosely inspired by daytime legal dramas like “Divorce Court” but involving actual litigants arguing actual cases. At his audition for “The People’s Court,” Judge Wapner was asked to hear an argument between a petite woman and her boyfriend, a professional football player. When the diminutive plaintiff finished her testimony, Judge Wapner saw the hulking defendant approaching her, and he unflinchingly instructed the man to sit down. The producers knew they had found their judge. Joined by a host, Doug Llewelyn, and Rusty Burrell, a bailiff who had served in the   trials of Charles Manson and Patricia Hearst, Judge Wapner deposed such unusual petitioners as a female oil wrestler who confessed to punching a competitor in the nose (she was ordered to pay $5, 000 in damages and was later prosecuted in a criminal trial) and a woman who refused to pay an advertised reward for her missing dog to claimants who had brought her the dog’s remains (she was told she did not have to pay them). Judge Wapner became such a trusted figure that in 1986, he agreed to oversee the disbursement of a   settlement awarded to a group of 141 families in the Fullerton, Calif. area, who sued development groups and oil companies for not warning them that an abandoned refinery dump near their homes was potentially hazardous. A poll conducted by The Washington Post in 1989 found that while   of those surveyed could not name any of the nine justices on the United States Supreme Court, 54 percent could identify Judge Wapner as the judge of “The People’s Court. ” That same year, a study published by the National Center for State Courts found that caseloads for small claims courts across the country had nearly doubled and largely attributed that increase to the show’s influence. “The People’s Court” ceased production in 1993, but Judge Wapner returned to television in 1998 as the magistrate of “Judge Wapner’s Animal Court,” a   series on the Animal Planet cable channel. By that time, he had numerous competitors and imitators, including former Mayor Edward I. Koch of New York, who hosted a resurrected “People’s Court” from 1997 to 1999, as well as Judith Sheindlin, a former Manhattan family court judge, who since 1996 has presided over another television courtroom as “Judge Judy. ” Judge Sheindlin’s husband, Jerry, a former New York State Supreme Court judge, replaced Mr. Koch on “The People’s Court” and was in turn replaced in 2001 by Marilyn Milian, a former Florida Circuit Court judge, who has presided there ever since. Judge Sheindlin, whose show has long been one of the highest rated on daytime television, has freely acknowledged the inspirational debt she owes to Judge Wapner. “All the judges watched Judge Wapner,” she told Larry King in 2005. “All America at one point or another watched Judge Wapner. ” (Judge Wapner was not as kind to Judge Sheindlin, criticizing her in interviews for her brusque, often angry courtroom demeanor.) So many courtroom shows have been introduced since Judge Wapner’s initial success that in 2008, the Daytime Emmy Awards created a separate category: outstanding   program. Besides his son David, survivors include his wife, Mickey, and another son, Frederick, a judge on the Superior Court of Los Angeles. In addition to being a television star, Judge Wapner was a vocal advocate for the California judiciary. In 2005, he appeared in a series of television commercials opposing Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger’s Proposition 77, which would have given the power to draw legislative and congressional districts to a panel of three retired judges, and which voters rejected at the polls. “Judges should decide legal disputes,” Judge Wapner said in one of the ads. “Judges should not make law. ” In November 2009, Judge Wapner observed his 90th birthday by returning to “The People’s Court” to try a case. That same month he received a rare honor for a judge: a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.	1

128	Valentine’s Day is upon us again. It’s a time of candlelit dinners,   candy boxes from the drugstore and (depending on your relationship status) watching old romantic comedies while you drink wine by yourself. It’s a great celebration. But where did it come from? And why do we care about it so much? People have been trying to answer those questions for a long time. The New York Times pondered the day’s origin in 1853 but called it “one of those mysterious historical or antiquarian problems which are doomed never to be solved. ” Well, it’s 2017 so we’re going to try again. Here is a brief guide to some of the major Valentine’s Day theories, from ancient Rome to the present. The most common explanation for how Valentine’s Day came to be is the ancient festival of Lupercalia, a raucous,   fertility rite in which Roman men and women paired off. This theory has appeared in news articles for decades. Lupercalia was celebrated for centuries in the middle of February and eventually, as the Roman Empire became less pagan and more Christian, was transformed into a celebration honoring St. Valentine. Noel Lenski, a Yale historian, told National Public Radio in 2011 that the festival was known for its debauchery and nudity until Pope Gelasius I made it a Christian holiday in the fifth century. “It was a little more of a drunken revel, but the Christians put clothes back on it,” Lenski said. “That didn’t stop it from being a day of fertility and love. ” There is little reliable information about the life of St. Valentine. The Times reported in 1923 that the day may in fact celebrate two different saints named Valentine who were made into a composite character. (Neither one of them sounded particularly romantic.) According to one popular tale, printed in The Boston Globe in 1965, St. Valentine was arrested after he defied an order by Emperor Claudius that forbade Roman soldiers from getting married. St. Valentine was later beheaded for his religious zeal, a death that Roman men decided to celebrate by pulling the names of eligible young ladies out of an urn. “This custom persisted for many years and eventually found its way into Germany and England,” The Globe reported. Not everyone is convinced of that version of events. Jack B. Oruch, an English professor at the University of Kansas who died in 2013, studied Valentine’s Day as part of his research into the poet Geoffrey Chaucer. He was convinced that Chaucer was the source of our modern ideas about St. Valentine. In a 1981 academic article, “St. Valentine, Chaucer, and Spring in February,” Mr. Oruch argued there was no documented evidence of a romantic tradition linked to St. Valentine before Chaucer wrote the poems “Parlement of Foules” and “The Complaint of Mars” in the late 14th century. Chaucer may have connected St. Valentine to romance because it was convenient: His saint’s day, on Feb. 14, took place at a time when Britons in the 14th century thought spring began, with birds starting to mate and plants beginning to bloom, Mr. Oruch wrote. From Chaucer’s perspective, an added perk was that Europeans at the time thought “Valentine” was a   name. Other saints who were celebrated in   had names with less poetic appeal: St. Scholastica, St. Austrebertha, St. Eulalia and St. Eormenhild. It’s a compelling theory, but Mr. Oruch knew it was tough to compete with popular stories about romantic Romans. “The article made no difference,” he said in a 2011 interview, in reference to his research. “All the articles about Valentine’s Day each year repeat the same myths. ” Whatever its origins, Valentine’s Day is now a big deal. It can be stressful for some people because “it’s a night with very profound extra meaning that hits primitive parts of the brain linked with wanting,” said Helen Fisher, a Rutgers University physical anthropologist who studies the evolution of human sexuality. She said the need for love was “a basic brain system that evolved millions of years ago,” long before Lupercalia. “It’s a time of   and appraisal of your situation,” she said, especially if you’re single. “This is a day when one reflects on what you’ve got and what you don’t have. ” It’s also a day to spend money. The National Retail Federation said Americans were projected to spend $18. 2 billion, or an average $136. 57 per person, on things like candy, flowers, cards and fancy dinners for Valentine’s Day this year. Most of that will go toward romantic partners, but a sizable chunk will be spent on friends,   classmates and even pets. That reflects a change in the holiday from a celebration of romantic partners to “an    romp” that celebrates different kinds of affection and attachment, Dr. Fisher said. So, what if your only Valentine happens to be your cat? Dr. Fisher, whose work involves using scanners to study the brains of both the romantically committed and the recently dumped, said there is someone out there for everyone. “This brain system is like a sleeping cat,” she said. “It can awaken at any time at all. You just have to get out there. ”	1
482	WASHINGTON  —   The White House is considering giving the Pentagon more independent authority to conduct counterterrorism raids as part of an effort to accelerate the fight against the Islamic State and other militant organizations, administration officials said on Thursday. Such a step would allow military commanders to move more swiftly against terrorism suspects, streamlining a   process that often dragged on under the Obama administration, frustrating Pentagon officials. The White House press secretary, Sean Spicer, called the proposal “a philosophy more than a change in policy. ” He said that “the protocol is not changing in terms of what has to be signed off,” but added that Mr. Trump believed “these are the experts in the field. ” Critics say that giving the military more authority could lead to more problematic outcomes like the Special Operations raid in January in Yemen, which left a member of the Navy’s SEAL Team 6 dead, as well as about two dozen civilians. It could also leave the Pentagon to take the blame when things go wrong. But one Defense Department official pointed to comments by President Trump about the Yemen raid as a sign that military commanders would be held responsible for botched operations whether the president signed off on them or not. Mr. Trump and Defense Department officials have maintained that the January raid  —   the first such operation approved by the new president  —   was successful, saying that valuable intelligence was collected. Military officials have been advocating an increase in raids in Yemen in particular. On Thursday, the United States resumed its air attacks on targets in Yemen, conducting strikes against several suspected Qaeda sites across the   part of the country. The coordinated series of attacks occurred in three Yemeni provinces  —   Abyan, Shabwa and Baydha  —   that have been linked to terrorist activity, according to the Pentagon. The strikes were conducted against targets that had been developed before the January raid, a senior official said. On Monday, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis presented the White House, under Mr. Trump’s directive, with a series of options for accelerating the fight against the Islamic State. Pentagon officials say that while much of the proposal would continue what the United States was doing under President Barack Obama, Mr. Mattis and senior military commanders want to target not just the Islamic State, but also Al Qaeda and other extremist organizations in the Middle East. The proposal on counterterrorism raids, first reported by the Daily Beast, is the latest step in Mr. Trump’s increased reliance on military commanders to run American national security policy. Mr. Trump has become increasingly reliant on Mr. Mattis, a retired Marine general, upon whom he consistently lavishes praise. He has also appointed Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster as his national security adviser, to replace a retired general, Michael T. Flynn. His Homeland Security secretary is yet another retired general, John F. Kelly. “We’re at a point now in our nation where general officers have an outsize role in the direction of the country,” said Andrew Exum, a retired Army Ranger and a Defense Department official in the Obama administration. Still, Mr. Trump has already shown himself willing to blame the generals when things go wrong. On Tuesday, he told Fox News that the Jan. 29 Yemen mission that led to the death of the Navy SEAL team member, Senior Chief Petty Officer William Owens, known as Ryan, “was a mission that was started before I got here. ” He added that “my generals are the most respected that we’ve had in many decades, I believe, and they lost Ryan. ” Jon B. Alterman, the director of the Middle East Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said that the administration faced a delicate calculation over how much authority to cede to the generals. “One extreme,” he said, is “giving   in the White House veto power over generals in the field. ” That should be avoided, he said. “At the same time,” he added, “if you’re going to target and kill someone, there needs to be some kind of process to ensure that it serves a strategic purpose. We shouldn’t be comfortable with the other extreme, essentially handing out death sentences without much deliberation. ” Capt. Jeff Davis, a Pentagon spokesman, said that the strikes on Thursday in Yemen, which numbered more than 20, were “conducted in partnership with the government of Yemen and were coordinated” with President Abdu Rabbu Mansour Hadi. Captain Davis said the attacks had targeted Qaeda militants, equipment and infrastructure. After the January raid, Mr. Hadi’s government had withdrawn permission for the United States to conduct Special Operations ground missions, a decision prompted by anger at the civilian casualties incurred in the raid. Computers and cellphones seized during that raid offered clues about attacks that Al Qaeda might be planning, including insights into new types of hidden explosives that the group is making and new training tactics, American officials said. But it is still unclear how much the information advances the military’s knowledge of the plans of Al Qaeda’s branch in Yemen, and some intelligence and congressional officials have questioned how significant the information analyzed so far really is. “There are obvious contradictions about the relative value of intelligence,” said Senator Kamala D. Harris, a California Democrat on the Intelligence Committee, who added in an interview this week that she would be seeking more explanations from intelligence officials. According to a Yemeni military official, the airstrikes on Thursday in the Abyan mountains began around 3:30 a. m. local time. The local news media reported that at least three people suspected of being Qaeda members were killed in Shabwa Province. Residents near the scene in the Saeid region said an airstrike had destroyed a house used by Qaeda operatives. The death of Chief Owens came after a chain of miscues and misjudgments that plunged the elite forces into a ferocious   firefight with Qaeda militants in a mountainous village in central Yemen. Three other Americans were wounded, and a $75 million aircraft was deliberately destroyed. A month later, the mission remains under intense scrutiny, with questions unabated over the casualties, how Mr. Trump and his aides approved the raid over a dinner meeting at the White House five days into his presidency, and the value of the information collected from the raid. “It is reasonable for the White House to determine which decisions they need to be part of and which ones they are comfortable deferring to the Pentagon,” said Derek Chollet, an assistant secretary of defense in the Obama administration. “But a president has to think very carefully about this, because he may choose to delegate authority, but he cannot absolve himself of responsibility. ”	1
344	Biased? Probably. Oppositional? Maybe. Essential? In theory. But the enemy? Not so much. President Trump last week called the news media “the enemy of the American people. ” But in interviews around the country this week, Americans of varying political affiliations, even those with serious misgivings about the media, largely allowed that the president’s characterization had gone too far. “I think that was a bit much,” said Mark Huizingh, 67, a Trump supporter and furniture store owner in Grand Rapids, Mich. “That was a little too strong. ” Mr. Trump’s presidency has exacerbated already deep ideological divisions in the country, and Americans on one end of the political spectrum increasingly find themselves unable even to look their counterparts in the eye. But if there has been one instance in the last month when the rift has not seemed quite as large, perhaps it has been the response to Mr. Trump’s harsh rebuke of the media. Still, the feeling toward the news media among those interviewed was far from warm and fuzzy. Many said they believed the media was flawed in general, and certainly when it came to the coverage of Mr. Trump and his administration. “Trump may be exaggerating,” said Jodi Littell, 55, an English teacher from Miami, who was strolling around a shopping center with her husband. But, she added, “to some degree he’s right that the media is out to get him. ” Mr. Trump’s attempts to demonize the mainstream media are nothing new. He has referred to the news media as the “opposition party” and repeatedly called legitimate news organizations “fake news. ” He and his aides have also consistently attacked the media’s credibility, calling out factual mistakes made by organizations sometimes even after corrections were made. But if the tactics were meant to convince the public that the media was a deceitful adversary, they did not appear to be having quite the desired effect. According to a Quinnipiac University poll released on Wednesday, 61 percent of respondents said they disapproved of the way Mr. Trump talked about the media.   percent said they trusted the media more to tell the truth about important issues, while 37 percent said they trusted Mr. Trump more to do so. The political divide, however, is stark: Among Democrats, 86 percent said they trusted the media more to tell the truth, while 78 percent of Republicans said they trusted Mr. Trump more. A Fox News poll released last week showed respondents about evenly divided on whom they trusted more to tell the truth. “Nobody is perfect,” said Nick Lortie, 24, a plumber from Merrimack, N. H. who voted for the Libertarian candidate, Gary Johnson, in the presidential election. “It’s like if the weatherman says it’s going to rain and it doesn’t  —   if someone tells them something and it turns out to be wrong, it’s not their fault,” he said, referring to the media. Charles Mellison Jr. 77, a retired   truck driver and registered Democrat in Miami, said he thought Mr. Trump’s comments were intended to “throw people off. ” “He should be more respectful,” he added, as he sipped a cup of coffee. “The media are not liars. ” Rick Rutter, 56, a pastor and executive director of a local rescue mission from Nashua, N. H. chuckled at the idea that the media was the enemy of the American people. But he, like many others interviewed, said he did see a litany of problems with the press. “It’s like that quote,” he said. “‘If you don’t read the paper, you’re uninformed. If you do, you’re misinformed. ’” The news media, however, was acting like an enemy in at least one respect: It was exhausting him. During the   to the election, Mr. Rutter said, he had cut the cord in part because keeping up with different interpretations of current events on television had become fruitless. Not everyone was so quick to dismiss Mr. Trump’s comments as outlandish, however. (Half of the respondents to the Quinnipiac poll said they disapproved of the media’s coverage of Mr. Trump.) “I think it’s right and wrong,” Ted Friedman, 59, a   furniture upholsterer in Grand Rapids, said about likening the media to the enemy. “I think the media definitely is out there to stir the pot up and see what comes out of it. ” But he added that his complaints were directed at national news outlets, not his local media. “I think what we’re seeing in the mainstream  —   we’re talking CNN, Fox and so forth  —   I think we’re seeing the kids are on the playground,” he said. “Donald Trump’s on the playground, the media’s on the playground, and they’re all fighting for that one little swing. ” Gary Abernathy, 61, the editor and publisher of The   in Hillsboro, Ohio, which endorsed Mr. Trump for president, said part of the problem with the mainstream media’s coverage of Mr. Trump was that reporters at major newspapers ”don’t really get other parts of the country. ” “I do think it’s a failure to understand, and also a failure to respect the opinions of Trump voters,” he said. “I’m just a big believer in good journalism, and that’s what I hate seeing fall by the wayside in the coverage of Trump,” he added. “I think Trump should be critically covered, but he should be covered with fairness  —   not with animosity, not with a point of view. You want the press to simply be fair. ” Often, a negative perception of the media reflected a deeper frustration with coverage unrelated to coverage of Mr. Trump. “Holy moly  —   in my opinion, I believe they’re pretty biased,” Amber McDowell, 37, who owns a flower shop in Broadus, Mont. said about the news media. Still, Ms. McDowell, a registered Republican who said she had never voted for a Democrat in a presidential election, said she “wouldn’t go as far as ‘the enemy’ ” in describing the news media. “It’s just a lot of the bad events. You don’t ever see any of the good stuff with the soldiers and the good stuff with the police,” she said, adding, “In small town U. S. A. I believe that’s probably how a lot of us feel. ” Charles Funderburk, 46, a contractor in Little Rock, Ark. and a conservative Republican, said he felt he was “only getting  ” from the news media. “The media has its own agenda, just like the Democrats and Republicans do,” he said, as he loaded supplies into his pickup truck at Home Depot. “They want to tell us what they want to tell us when they want to tell us, if they want to tell us. ” Cindy Lyons, 40, who helps her husband run a tent rental business in Grand Rapids, also stopped short of siding with Mr. Trump’s characterization of the media but allowed that he might not be that far afield. “I don’t know if I agree with it, but I see where it’s coming from,” she said. Ms. Lyons, a mother of five boys who described herself as “kind of in the middle” in terms of her political leanings, said that while she did not think the media was untruthful, she, too, was put off by the frequent negative coverage. “You turn on the news, and you very rarely hear the good,” she said. “I know that’s the norm, because people aren’t really out reporting on things that are going great. ” But even those critical of the news media and its coverage of Mr. Trump appeared ready to give it all a rest. “People already voted him in,” said Richard Bryant, 48, a construction project manager in Little Rock. “Let’s move on and make America great again. ”	1
334	Mildred Dresselhaus, a professor emerita at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology whose research into the fundamental properties of carbon helped transform it into the superstar of modern materials science and the nanotechnology industry, died on Monday in Cambridge, Mass. She was 86. Her death, at Mount Auburn Hospital, was confirmed by her granddaughter Leora Cooper. No cause was given. Nicknamed the Queen of Carbon in scientific circles, Dr. Dresselhaus was renowned for her efforts to promote the cause of women in science. She was the first woman to secure a full professorship at M. I. T. in 1968, and she worked vigorously to ensure that she would not be the last. In 1971, she and a colleague organized the first Women’s Forum at M. I. T. to explore the roles of women in science. Two years later she won a Carnegie Foundation grant to further that cause. “I met Millie on my interview for a faculty job in 1984,” said Lorna Gibson, now a professor of materials science and engineering. “M. I. T. was quite intimidating then for a new female, but Millie made it all seem possible, even effortless. I knew it wouldn’t be, but she was such an approachable intellectual powerhouse, she made it seem that way. ” Today, women make up about 22 percent of M. I. T. ’s faculty. “Millie was very straightforward, no frilly stuff, and I loved that about her,” said Jacqueline K. Barton, a professor of chemistry at the California Institute of Technology. “She was always warm and supportive to me, but I also had the feeling it was important to let her know about my last good experiment. ” Dr. Dresselhaus’s own story was one of struggle and perseverance. The daughter of impoverished Jewish immigrants from Poland, she grew up humbly in the Bronx, sometimes on public assistance, but excelled in school  —   winning scholarships, finding a mentor in a future Nobel laureate and earning advanced degrees at leading universities. This month, Dr. Dresselhaus found a measure of popular culture fame at the center of a General Electric TV commercial that boasts of a corporate commitment to hiring more women. In the ad, little girls play with Millie Dresselhaus dolls and dress up in Millie Dresselhaus wigs and sweaters. Parents name their newborn girls Millie, and journalists breathlessly seek the next Dresselhaus sighting. Dr. Dresselhaus appears in the commercial as well. “What if we treated great female scientists like they were stars?” the narrator says. “What if Millie Dresselhaus were as famous as any celebrity?” For its part, carbon is as capricious as any celebrity. It is the graphite of a pencil, worn down by a simple doodle. Arrayed in a   crystal, it is a diamond, the hardest substance known. Dr. Dresselhaus used resonant magnetic fields and lasers to map out the electronic energy structure of carbon. She investigated the traits that emerge when carbon is interwoven with other materials: Stitch in some alkali metals, for example, and carbon can become a superconductor, in which an electric current meets virtually no resistance. Dr. Dresselhaus was a pioneer in research on fullerenes, also called buckyballs:    cages of carbon atoms that can be used as drug delivery devices, lubricants, filters and catalysts. She conceived the idea of rolling a   sheet of carbon atoms into a hollow tube, a notion eventually realized as the nanotube  —   a versatile structure with the strength of steel but just one   the width of a human hair. She worked on carbon ribbons, semiconductors, nonplanar monolayers of molybdenum sulfide, and the scattering and vibrational effects of tiny particles introduced into ultrathin wires. She published more than 1, 700 scientific papers,   eight books and gathered a stack of accolades as fat as a nanotube is fine. Dr. Dresselhaus was awarded the National Medal of Science, the Presidential Medal of Freedom (bestowed by President Barack Obama) the Kavli Prize in Nanoscience, the Enrico Fermi prize and dozens of honorary doctorates. She also served as president of the American Physical Society and the American Association for the Advancement of Science and worked in the Department of Energy in the Clinton administration. “Every morning she’d leave the house at 5:30, the first car in the parking lot every day, and everyone she collaborated with she viewed as family,” said Ms. Cooper, Dr. Dresselhaus’s granddaughter, who is a graduate student at M. I. T. “Her life and her science were intertwined. ” She was born Mildred Spiewak on Nov. 11, 1930, in Brooklyn and raised in the Bronx, the daughter of the former Ethel Teichtheil and Meyer Spiewak. “My early years were spent in a dangerous, multiracial,   neighborhood,” she wrote in a biographical sketch. “My early elementary school memories up through ninth grade are of teachers struggling to maintain class discipline with occasional coverage of academics. ” For all the family’s financial hardships, Mildred and her older brother, Irving, became gifted violinists who won scholarships to music schools. From age 6 on, Mildred took the subway long distances on her own, burdened, as she recalled, with books and musical instruments as she stumbled down steps. When somebody told her about Hunter High School, the highly selective public school in Manhattan, she wrote away for old entry exams, studied them and then aced the test. There, her predilections were clear: “In math and science,” the yearbook declared, Mildred Spiewak is “second to none. ” After graduating she enrolled at Hunter College, where she intended to become a schoolteacher until she took an elementary physics class with Rosalyn Yalow, a future Nobel laureate, who urged her to consider a career in science. “She was a very domineering person,” Dr. Dresselhaus said in an interview in 2012. “She had definite ideas about everything. ” Dr. Yalow, she wrote in the biographical sketch, “became a lifelong mentor. ” Dr. Dresselhaus earned a master’s degree from Radcliffe College and a Ph. D. from the University of Chicago, where she studied under the celebrated physicist Enrico Fermi. She lived in his neighborhood, and every morning they would walk to the university together talking science. The conversations were thrilling, she said, and they kept her going through a grueling program from which 75 percent of the students dropped out. At Chicago she met Gene Dresselhaus, a fellow physicist, and married him. He survives her, as do her four children, Marianne, Carl, Paul and Eliot and, besides Ms. Cooper, four other grandchildren, M. I. T. said. Dr. Dresselhaus and her husband both ended up at M. I. T. in 1960, one of the few places willing to hire    scientists. There she worked at Lincoln Laboratory, a defense research center, where she was one of two women on a scientific staff of 1, 000. “We were pretty much invisible,” she later recalled. One reason Dr. Dresselhaus said she chose to study carbon was its relative unpopularity. “I was happy to work on a project that most people thought was hard and not that interesting,” she said. “If one day I had to be at home with a sick child, it wouldn’t be the end of the world. ”	1
477	Sergey I. Kislyak, the longtime Russian ambassador to the United States, hosted a dazzling dinner in his     mansion four blocks north of the White House to toast Michael A. McFaul just weeks before he took up his post as the American envoy to Russia. It was, Mr. McFaul recalled, an “   extraordinary dinner,” including five courses of Russian fusion cuisine for 50 seated guests who shared one main characteristic: They were government officials intimately involved in formulating Russia policy for the Obama administration, including senior figures from the Defense and State Departments. “I admired the fact that he was trying to reach deep into our government to cultivate relations with all kinds of people,” Mr. McFaul said of the dinner in late 2011. “I was impressed by the way he went about that kind of socializing, the way he went about entertaining, but always with a political objective. ” Mr. Kislyak’s networking success has landed him at the center of a sprawling controversy and made him the most prominent, if politically radioactive, ambassador in Washington. Two advisers to President Trump have run into trouble for not being more candid about contacts with Mr. Kislyak: Michael T. Flynn, who was forced to resign as national security adviser, and now Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who admitted two previously undisclosed conversations. Mr. Kislyak also met during the transition with Mr. Trump’s    and adviser, Jared Kushner. A career diplomat raised in the Soviet era, Mr. Kislyak, 66, (pronounced  ) may seem an unlikely protagonist in such a drama. He has interacted with American officials for decades and been a fixture on the Washington scene for the past nine years, jowly and cordial with an easy smile and fluent if accented English, yet a pugnacity in advocating Russia’s assertive policies. Invited to think tanks to discuss arms control, he would invariably offer an unapologetic defense of Russia’s intervention in Ukraine and assail Americans for what he portrayed as their hypocrisy  —   then afterward approach a debating partner to suggest dinner. “Not all of us, myself included, initially appreciated his very tough,    style,” said Dimitri K. Simes, president of the Center for the National Interest and an advocate of closer   relations, who hosted a dinner at his home for Mr. Kislyak after his arrival in Washington and regularly invited him to events at his center. “But we gradually came to develop a grudging respect for him as someone who was really representing the positions of his country. ” Mr. Simes introduced Mr. Kislyak to Mr. Trump in a receiving line last April at a foreign policy speech hosted by his center at the Mayflower Hotel in Washington. Mr. Kislyak was one of four ambassadors who sat in the front row for Mr. Trump’s speech at the invitation of the center. Mr. Simes noted that Mr. Sessions, then a senator from Alabama, was there, but he did not notice whether he and the ambassador spoke at that time. The Russian Embassy did not respond to an email on Thursday, but Mr. Kislyak defended engagements with American officials last November, when he was asked during a speech at Stanford University about allegations of Russian meddling in the elections. Mr. Kislyak echoed his government’s line that it was not involved in hacking. He said it was natural for diplomats to attend events such as political conventions and foreign policy speeches by candidates. “It is normal diplomatic work that we have been doing: It is our job to understand, to know people, both on the side of the Republicans and Democrats,” he said. “I personally have been working in the United States for so long that I know almost everybody. ” Even some critics of Russian policy said it was hardly surprising that Mr. Kislyak would meet people around Mr. Trump. “That was part of his job,” said Steven Pifer, a former ambassador to Ukraine who is now at the Brookings Institution. “I don’t see anything nefarious in that per se, and I don’t think it was out of the box for Senator Sessions to talk with Kislyak. ” An expert on arms control negotiations with a degree from the Moscow Engineering Physics Institute, Mr. Kislyak first served in the Washington embassy from 1985 to 1989 during the late Soviet period. He became the first Russian representative to NATO and was ambassador to Belgium from 1998 to 2003. He returned to Moscow, where he spent five years as a deputy foreign minister. He was appointed ambassador to Washington in 2008. “He is a brilliant, highly professional diplomat  —   affable, pleasant, unbelievably good at arms control and   relations for decades,” said Sergei A. Karaganov, a periodic Kremlin adviser on foreign policy. Some Russian foreign policy experts compared him to Anatoly F. Dobrynin, the Soviet ambassador to Washington from 1962 to 1986 and a political player in both capitals. Until recently, at least, Mr. Kislyak played a more discreet, quiet role in Washington and was even less visible in Moscow. “I would describe him as Russia’s top authority on the United States,” said Vladimir Frolov, a foreign policy analyst. The questions about contacts between Mr. Trump’s circle and Russian officials have revealed what both sides presumably knew, that American intelligence agencies closely track Mr. Kislyak’s movements and tap his phone calls. Russian officials on Thursday expressed anger that their ambassador’s actions were being questioned and that some news reports suggested he might be an intelligence operative. Maria Zakharova, the spokeswoman for the Russian Foreign Ministry, delivered an extended diatribe during her weekly briefing against what she called the low professional standards of the American news media. “I will reveal a military secret to you: Diplomats work, and their work consists of carrying out contacts in the country where they are present,” she said. “This is on record everywhere. If they do not carry out these contacts, do not participate in negotiations, then they are not diplomats. ” Until Vladimir V. Putin returned to the Russian presidency in 2012 and tensions between Washington and Moscow rose again, Mr. Kislyak was a popular host, especially for weekend events at the estate at Pioneer Point in Maryland, which the Obama administration ordered closed last December over the hacking allegations. He invited the Americans who negotiated the New Start nuclear arms treaty and their families to a party at the estate. Russian security guards took the children of his guests tubing on the ambassador’s boat. During the treaty negotiations, Mr. McFaul remembered, Mr. Kislyak frequently telephoned the secretary of defense or others involved, thwarting the American desire to limit his channels of communication. “He was actively pushing to try to find fissures and disagreements among us,” Mr. McFaul said. “He is very smart, very experienced, always well prepared,” said R. Nicholas Burns, a former under secretary of state who negotiated three Iran sanctions resolutions at the United Nations with Mr. Kislyak. “But he could be cynical, obstreperous and inflexible, and had a Soviet mentality. He was very aggressive toward the United States. ” Some of that aggression was on display at the Stanford event last fall, which was moderated by Mr. McFaul. Saying that he had been sent to Washington to improve relations, Mr. Kislyak named areas of possible cooperation, but then went through a long list of grievances, accusing the United States of meddling around the globe. When an audience member asked about Russian mistakes, he demurred. He said the most serious problem with the United States is that it believes it is exceptional. “The difference between your exceptionalism and ours is that we are not trying to impose on you ours, but you do not hesitate to impose on us yours,” he said. “That is something we do not appreciate. ” He has told associates that he will leave Washington soon, likely to be replaced by a   general. His name recently surfaced at the United Nations as a candidate for a new post responsible for counterterrorism, diplomats there said. Vitaly I. Churkin, the Russian ambassador to the United Nations, died last month and that post remains vacant. For Mr. Kislyak, Washington is no longer the place it once was. It has become lonely, and he has told associates that he is surprised how people who once sought his company were now trying to stay away.	1
676	 A top Republican wants the federal government to spend half a billion dollars so states can make people on food stamps pass drug tests. Legislation Rep. Robert Aderholt (R-Ala.) proposes would cut Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program spending by $1.2 billion, then plow $600 million into grants for states to carry out drug testing programs. Federal law doesn’t currently allow states to drug test food stamp recipients, an obstacle that has prevented Republicans in Georgia, Wisconsin and elsewhere from carrying out the policy. Aderholt’s bill would allow drug tests, but not require them.… in addition to allowing states to wilfully administer drug tests to food stamp recipients, the controversial bill would also require potential recipients to be tested for actual hunger every time prior to being issued food stamps.“Look at what’s going on right now,” the Alabama Rep. said. “The United States budget is hemorrhaging money because of drug addicts who are misusing food stamps to purchase narcotics, but what many people don’t realize is the fact that they are only part of the problem. There are many other so-called ‘legitimately poor people’ who are also receiving food stamps, but are using them to buy things like hot-tubs, motorbikes, finance pool parties and getting their hands on the latest iPhone or MacBook … That’s why, as a way of making sure food stamps actually go to hungry people, I propose we introduce hunger tests prior to issuing the stamps to every potential beneficiary. The logistics of it are still in the works, but from what I can gather, we’d be using a benign chemical that would be able to tell whether or not a person is experiencing hunger from their saliva. The chemical would be located on the stamps themselves, and upon licking the stamp, as you would a simple stamp at a post office, we would know straight away if a person is trying to trick us or if they really deserve food.

185	David Longstreth makes music in a former  ’s workshop on the east side of Los Angeles, in an unlovely, industrial part of town. His studio sits beside a wide boulevard without nearby stop signs, red lights or crosswalks, so cars and trucks hurtle past day and night at terrifying speeds. One recent afternoon, Longstreth edged up to the curb, head swiveling. He wore an unkempt beard and scuffed desert boots that  —   after he spotted a narrow gap in traffic  —   transported him across the asphalt and into a bodega on the other side. There, he bought two gallon jugs of filtered water. He was planning a full night of recording and, he explained, “the tap water here is kind of jank. ” For the last decade and a half, Longstreth has been putting out music under the name Dirty Projectors, and it was here, beside the   death gantlet, that he finished his first new LP in four years, out next week: a   breakup album that he calls the most emotionally taxing thing he has made. His studio was cavernous, with gaping skylights and a battalion of movable soundproofing panels that Longstreth built D. I. Y.  using materials from Home Depot. These stood sentry around a drum kit, a piano and assorted microphones and amps. An iMac, loaded with ProTools production software, sat atop a Giotto monograph and a massive tome called “Recording the Beatles. ” Leaned against a wall were framed portraits of Missy Elliott, Joni Mitchell and Beethoven  —   an unimpeachable holy trinity. Longstreth, 35, draws from a wide range of references, and in between seven   Dirty Projectors albums he has put his fingerprints all over work by an impressive variety of artists. He teamed up with David Byrne to write a song and with Bjork to write several he   adventurous R. B. with Solange Knowles devised orchestral arrangements for Joanna Newsom produced an album by the Tuareg rock guitarist Bombino and, most recognizably, wrote the luminous bridge that Rihanna sings on “FourFiveSeconds,” a smash hit from 2015 that also features Kanye West and Paul McCartney. Speaking to an interviewer in 2012, Bjork praised Longstreth’s “almost psychic ability to write for other voices. ” A freight train rumbled past the studio on tracks abutting the building. Fiddling with the placement of two microphones, Longstreth seemed not to notice. Before long, I detected another, gentler source of noise pollution. A cricket had moved into the ceiling, and its intermittent chirping provided a hypnotic overhead beat. Longstreth moved to a worn old couch and, fooling around on an electric guitar, briefly improvised against it. Longstreth has not yet made an LP of cricket duets, but you could almost imagine it. He is a playful conceptualist whose music moves in a handful of directions all at once. Dirty Projectors’ critical breakthrough was the album “Rise Above,” from 2007, in which Longstreth tried to recreate Black Flag’s 1981 punk landmark, “Damaged,” wholly from memory. The result  —   a covers record riddled with the flubs and inventions of forgetfulness  —   was a jumble of intricate syncopations, vertiginous time changes and splintery guitar work. “Rise Above” was Longstreth’s fourth album, and his first to feature the singer and guitarist Amber Coffman, who joined the cast of musicians Longstreth relied upon to tour and record. Coffman became his girlfriend, and she proved crucial to the success of the band’s next album, “Bitte Orca,” which came out in 2009 and won Dirty Projectors a wave of new fans. Longstreth’s ideas about harmony, rhythm and arranging remained unconventional, but his songwriting grew brighter and more direct. Coffman’s voice, with its strong, clean phrasing, helped this music to pass, after a fashion, as a kind of alien pop. At the couple’s apartment in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, domestic rituals bled into the creative process, and vice versa. When they watched Wim Wenders’s “Wings of Desire” together, Longstreth asked Coffman to write down dialogue that resonated with her. These jottings became lyrics for the band’s biggest single, “Stillness Is the Move,” in 2009, on which Coffman emulated the   feats of R. B. stars like Mariah Carey and Destiny’s Child. Accompanying her, Longstreth played a West   guitar riff that sounded like something colorful shattering. The song put Dirty Projectors at the forefront of the booming Brooklyn   scene, alongside simpatico acts like Vampire Weekend, Animal Collective and Grizzly Bear. These bands booked worldwide tours, landed prominent festival slots, licensed songs to ad campaigns and crossed over to mainstream audiences. Among Dirty Projectors’ converts was Jay Z, who sent a handwritten note asking them to join a festival he was organizing the   star Diplo, who flew Coffman and Longstreth to Jamaica to work with him and the French rockers Phoenix, who invited the band to open for them at Madison Square Garden. In 2013, after a year of intense touring to support Dirty Projectors’ assured sixth album, “Swing Lo Magellan,” Longstreth and Coffman split. The album was not the commercial success Longstreth had hoped for. “You think an album’s gonna propel you forward, and then it doesn’t, at least not immediately,” says Brett Williams, the music manager who represents both Longstreth and Coffman. This shortfall, paired with the breakup, sent Longstreth into a depression. “I was super bummed,” he said. “The band and my relationship with Amber had become so intertwined that, when we broke up, it felt like everything that had defined my life for a decade was suddenly gone. ” Gradually he began making music again “to try to work through what I was feeling. ” The first song he released was the sparse, glitchy “Keep Your Name. ” In writing the lyrics, he drew on a     convention: “It’s a divorce song,” Longstreth said. The opening line is “I don’t know why you abandoned me,” and he soon drops a knotty clue about fissures between him and Coffman: “What I want from art is truth  —   what you want is fame. ” In building the vocals, meanwhile, Longstreth digitally lowered the pitch of his singing in a nod to DJ Screw, a Houston   innovator who wrung from this effect a narcotic quality that Longstreth was curious to explore in his song about heartbreak. The single, smoldering with recrimination, offered the first outward sign of turbulence within the group. Two weeks after its release, last fall, Coffman put out her own single, “All to Myself,” about finding solace in solitude. It emerged that she had an album of solo material due in 2017. Conjecture filled blog posts and comment sections. What was going on with Dirty Projectors? What did these dueling releases mean? The answer was complicated. After their breakup, Longstreth and Coffman reached a détente solid enough that she asked him to produce her solo record. “It was a good thing for our friendship, to reverse the roles we’d played in Dirty Projectors, where everything had been in the service of my vision,” Longstreth said. “Here, I was in service of her ideas, trying to bring them out into the world. We were reinventing how we related to each other. ” By the end of 2015, they’d more or less finished the album. In an act of symbolic accord, its last song shared musical motifs with the last song on Longstreth’s. Around this time, however, things soured again, and when I spoke with Longstreth in his studio, he said that, with some stray exceptions, he and Coffman hadn’t spoken in a year. “I want us to be close friends, and to work together again,” he said. But “things between us,” he noted unhappily, “have been better. ” Now each of their projects was scheduled to come out within a couple of months of the other: They weren’t talking, but their music was in direct conversation. On the floor of Longstreth’s studio were 15 stacks of index cards. The topmost cards bore different inscriptions in black Sharpie: These were names of new songs in various stages of completion, with each stack containing Longstreth’s notes for a different song. “Uh, I guess you can look at those,” he said when he saw me standing over the stacks. He explained that this organizational system was one he used on “Dirty Projectors” too, but as to whether another album was underway, he demurred: “I’m just working through some numbers. ” An engineer named Robby Moncrieff commandeered the iMac, dialing up the ProTools session for a song currently called “Suck My Lifestyle. ” It featured a riot of snares, bongos, tambourines, cabasas,   and claps. Some of these instruments were acoustic others,  . The acoustic sounds derived from recordings Longstreth made of the virtuoso percussionist Mauro Refosco, who backs Thom Yorke and Flea in the band Atoms for Peace. Longstreth had manipulated these recordings, sampling individual hits and rearranging them, with software, into wild new configurations. “It’s a way to use the dynamics and imperfections of his performance to make an impossible rhythm,” Longstreth said. “Suck My Lifestyle” contained a place holder guitar riff that was, like the beat, a product of ample technological mediation. Longstreth had cut and pasted recordings of his own playing, then rearranged these snippets to compose a new riff. The ensuing melody behaved in unexpected ways  —   doubling back on itself, unfurling, stammering. As Moncrieff recorded him, Longstreth sat with an acoustic guitar and diligently replayed the digitized riff live, returning it to the realm of the analog: an oil painting of a Photoshop collage. Much of the music on “Dirty Projectors,” he told me, had come together in this way. Whereas fragmentation and reconciliation are major themes on any breakup album, Longstreth had made them compositional strategies too. When I asked him to explain the tensions with Coffman, Longstreth declined, out of respect for her, he said, and to “keep certain personal things personal. ” But many lyrics on “Dirty Projectors” grapple with the breakup, whether it’s lines in “Keep Your Name” about   or his seeming admission, on the slithering “Death Spiral,” that he “condescended relentlessly. ” After I inquired into their romantic troubles, Longstreth said his desire was to “leave it to the music,” while reminding me that the album was a work of art, grounded in truth but subject to distortions. “Not a journal,” he said. (Coffman declined to speak to me for this article. Her publicist said, “Her focus right now is on her own music. ”) For Longstreth, moreover, the three years it took to make the album had allowed its meaning to dilate. He initially wrote the second single, “Little Bubble,” to describe the sphere of happiness he and Coffman temporarily shared, but here in 2017 “bubble” had become a buzzword, referring to the supposedly cosseted perspective of “coastal elites,” and now the song’s poignant refrain  —   “we had our own little bubble, for a while”  —   sounded like a postelection elegy. Longstreth hoped when he wrote “Dirty Projectors” for such added resonances to accrue, and in devising motifs that worked in the context of a breakup album but also brooked alternate interpretations, he was inspired in part by his exposure, while working on “FourFiveSeconds,” to the songwriting methods of Kanye West. (According to Longstreth, West initially envisioned that track as a solo, then added Rihanna.) In 2015 West asked Longstreth over to his L. A. home to toss around ideas. West routinely assembles motley creative brain trusts, and the brusque,   Bronx rapper French Montana and the slick Canadian singer the Weeknd were there, too. This invitation led to another, to the Mexican seaside village of Punta Mita, where West rented a mansion belonging to the “Girls Gone Wild” impresario Joe Francis and transformed it into a songwriting headquarters for his album “The Life of Pablo. ” Longstreth, a coffee geek who observes a precise   ritual, brought along his own ceramic dripper and, as he   put it, “Third Wave roasted beans,” which apparently entertained West’s wife, Kim Kardashian. “She asked me, ‘Are you making, like, a caramel macchiato? ’’u2009” Longstreth recalled. Other guests included Ezra Koenig of Vampire Weekend and the rappers Rhymefest and Big Sean. “Kanye has this discursive way of working, getting input from a range of people, that I thought was really cool,” Longstreth said. He described a moment when West played a tape he’d made of Paul McCartney playing a Wurlitzer while West improvised a vocal, feeling his way through the music by making nonsense sounds. Amid this gibberish, “something he sang sounded sort of like ‘Memories can get you into trouble,’’u2009” Longstreth recalled. Struck by this phrase, he and Koenig went off to write a song exploring its potential meanings. “Like, maybe you’re with your girlfriend but thinking of your ex,” Longstreth explained. After Mexico, Longstreth kept in touch with Elon Rutberg, one of West’s main creative advisers, and solicited his feedback about “Dirty Projectors. ” Of the “Memories” song, Longstreth added, “Kanye didn’t wind up using it, but it was good  —   maybe something will come of it down the line. ” The path that Longstreth took to hanging out with Kanye West in Mexican mansions is improbable. He grew up on five acres of farmland in central Connecticut, where his parents moved from the Bay Area in the late ’70s. They levied a prohibition on video games and grew their own food. “They were into subsistence farming  —   ‘back to the land,’’u2009” he says. “They had a cow or two, sheep, goats, geese. They made their own cheese. We ate eggs from our chickens, who were my responsibility. ” His older brother, Jake, exposed him to “cool stuff,” David recalls, like “music and drawing. He showed me how to play the riff from Nirvana’s ‘Come as You Are. ’’u2009” Through Nirvana, Jake, who is now a painter in Los Angeles, got into “other weirder, smaller bands from the late ’80s and ’90s West Coast underground,” Longstreth continued, “and from there, into the first generation of punk. ” Their parents, he added, “were rock ’n’ rollers in the ’60s, but they listened pretty widely: baroque music titans of ’40s, ’50s, ’60s jazz the ‘Big Chill’ soundtrack. ” In 1999, when Jake left for college in Portland, Ore. David inherited his Tascam   recorder. With all these influences swimming through his head, he recalled, he “started making albums. My brother still has a suitcase with, like, 100 tapes we made as kids. ” Longstreth’s early recordings were rough by design:     and even ugly. “I used to feel that musical knowledge and emotional   were antagonistic,” he said, invoking bedrock punk principles. “But I was too curious about chords and instruments and recording to stay locked in that mentality. ” He enrolled at Yale, where he studied music, but was unhappy. “It was about training the next generation of global power elite,” Longstreth said of the campus culture. “It wasn’t about intellectual curiosity or mastery. ” He dropped out and traveled to Portland, where Jake had enmeshed himself in the   demimonde, and where David began giving his own concerts at house parties. After about a year, he returned to Yale to finish his degree. “It would not have been cool with my parents if I didn’t,” he explained. There, he assumed the name Dirty Projectors and made one of his best, and strangest, albums, “The Getty Address,” which was a   tracing the spiritual wanderings of a fictitious version of the Eagles’ Don Henley. The libretto was a fanciful meditation on, among other things, entwined forms of imperialism, and in Longstreth’s rendering Henley became a sort of   Oppenheimer, conflicted about his epochal hits and their role in the flattening of world culture. For the music, Longstreth “wrote and recorded arrangements for wind septet, women’s choir and cello octet,” according to accompanying text, then “digitally deconstructed” these sessions “and sang over the reconstituted parts. ” Songs alluded to Steve Reich, Justin Timberlake and, as Longstreth put it to me, “a kitschy, exoticist, American fantasy of what Chinese music sounds like. ” These collisions of era and idiom doubled, for him, as elaborate   arguments, but you didn’t need to fully grasp these in order to appreciate the album’s   beauty. By the time Longstreth moved to Brooklyn, he was something of a minor legend in   circles: ascetic, eccentric and respected for it. Ezra Koenig told me that, in college, he passingly considered becoming a music critic, but the only review he ever wrote was an “embarrassing” rave, published in the online magazine Dusted, about Dirty Projectors’ 2003 debut album. A couple of years later, Koenig befriended Longstreth and came aboard Dirty Projectors as a touring saxophonist and keyboardist  —   joining an   group of musicians whose members also included the bassist Nat Baldwin, the drummer Brian McOmber and the singers Haley Dekle and Angel Deradoorian. When Longstreth moved to a place in   Koenig, then a schoolteacher, was among his roommates. “I remember him recording music in the middle of the night, when I had to be up at 7 a. m. for work,” Koenig said. The friendship survived, and Koenig was among Longstreth’s sounding boards as he   “Dirty Projectors” for release. “I watched him go from living in a windowless room, making what most people would call difficult music, to being a part of Rihanna and Solange songs,” Koenig said. He added that, even as Longstreth’s profile has risen, there has been a constancy to his music: “Compositionally, he does harmonic stuff no one else is doing. There’s a thread that runs through all Dave’s work, where the sensibility is unmistakably him. ” One morning, I met Longstreth for breakfast burritos near the house in Highland Park that he shares with his girlfriend, an artist liaison at an L. A. gallery. Afterward we walked to his cluttered Prius, where he retrieved “The Fractal Geometry of Nature,” a book by the mathematician Benoit Mandelbrot featuring   fractals. “This is a late Christmas present for my friend Zach Harris,” Longstreth explained. “He’s a painter, and his studio’s just down the block. Do you want to pop in on him?” Longstreth moved to California in 2014, and through his girlfriend and his brother, he gained entry into a circle of fine artists in town. He enjoyed visiting with Harris, he said, and trading ideas about work: “Zach has this whole cosmology behind everything he does. ” Lately they’d been discussing tantalizing geometries, like Fibonacci spirals and Mandelbrot sets, and these conversations inspired Longstreth’s gift. Harris welcomed Longstreth into his studio with a hug. He wore a mustache and   white jeans. His work space, he explained, “used to be a grow house. I converted it three years ago, and we found all this weed still here. Some bullets too. ” A dozen or so paintings ringed the room, all very large. Many were covered and crisscrossed by carved pieces of wood that Harris had machined with a laser, then painted   colors. Between these lattices he’d inscribed legions of   tiny figures engaged in odd, feverish interactions. I spied a roaring lion near a cluster of winged archers and, in a cheekier register, a parody of the “March of Progress” illustration that riffed on Nike’s Jumpman logo. Longstreth inspected a painting up close, in which a woman and a devil were engaged in a contortive sex act. “Stories start suggesting themselves,” Harris said, “and I follow them. I’m really into making these little universes you can get lost in. ” The two seemed to regard each other as kindred spirits. “Dave and I talk a lot about structures that all art forms share,” Harris went on. Longstreth nodded. “I love thinking of one medium as analogous to another, even if they aren’t, quite,” he replied. “Working on this new album, I’d lose focus on a song after a while, but thinking of it as if it were a painting allowed me to come at it again, in a new light. ” Harris waved a hand over one of his canvases. “There’s a   thing here and an Egyptian thing here  —   in painting, you can take all these different visual languages and styles and put them together. There’s a sense of that in Dave’s songs, too. Traditions he’s bringing together and synthesizing. ” Longstreth appeared to blush at the sound of his friend describing his music with such care. “Maybe,” he said, shrugging. He lingered a bit more, paging through the Mandelbrot book. “He figured out the math and ratios that generate this stuff,” Longstreth said. “There are names for all of these. ” Before long, Longstreth said goodbye and made for his Prius, which he pointed toward his studio. It was nearly noon, and he had his own little universe to get lost in.	1
998	 More than 70 children have been reported missing in the past week in north-east Kansas, as lawmakers admit the city is gripped by a “child abduction epidemic.” According to reports, the epidemic of missing children began after three sisters went missing from a northeast Kansas foster home on Aug. 26.Since then, an unprecedented number of missing children cases have been reported in recent weeks, with the situation becoming critical in the last few days. Lt. Jarrod Gill with the Tonganoxie Police Department said police learned from interviews that the girls had said they were experiencing problems at home and were planning to run away. KVC Kansas, one of the foster care contractors, said it has 38 missing children. The other company, Saint Francis Community Services, said 36 are missing in its system.Chad Anderson, chief clinical officer at KVC Kansas, one of the contractors, told a child welfare task force that the number of missing represented about 1 percent of the foster care population and is in line with the national average. “You heard everyone expressing that it is extremely concerning and worrisome, especially when many of them are teenage girls in the light of the issues surrounding human trafficking,” Gilmore said.But she also said that in many cases, children have left to go back to their biological families or other people with whom they have a relationship in order to try to not be in foster care. Gilmore referenced one task force member’s comment that at times children who have fled will call to say they are safe but won’t say where they are.“So it isn’t always a tragedy but some certainly can be and that’s why we have to take it all very seriously,” Gilmore said. Allow me to share with you who the children are, we consider missing. In 92 percent of the cases, they are young people, ages 12 and older. They have been removed from the only home they know, placed in an unfamiliar setting, and they miss their families, their schools and their communities. And they are eager to find a way to get back to them. The teens are not incarcerated, or under constant watch.They are typical youth who go to school, hang out with friends and participate in activities. As parents, we expect our children to return home each day to us — their family, a home filled with love, support and rules. To a child not accustomed to these things and with a family he/she doesn’t know, it is plain to see why some runaway. An estimated 1 percent of youth in foster care run away. This corresponds with the national average.	0
21	President Trump has blamed “obstruction by Democrats” for delays in confirming his senior appointments, saying on Twitter that “it is a disgrace that my full cabinet is still not in place. ” But the slow pace of filling out Mr. Trump’s cabinet can be attributed in part to decisions made in the early days of the nominee vetting process. The Trump transition team deviated from the practices of recent Democratic and Republican administrations, according to five people directly involved with the transition process. The Trump team chose to skip a practice of grilling nominees to prepare them and protect the president from potential embarrassment during the confirmation process. Candidates, for example, were not asked about financial conflicts and past vices  —   known informally as the “sex, drugs and rock ’n’ roll” questions. The rushed approach has led to some of Mr. Trump’s nominees  —   many with immense wealth and complex business interests  —   being held back by unexpected revelations. Representative Tom Price of Georgia, his pick for secretary of the Health and Human Services Department, placed stock trades that were questioned Andrew F. Puzder, the labor secretary nominee, hired an undocumented household worker Representative Mick Mulvaney of South Carolina, the choice for budget director, skipped paying taxes on a nanny and Steven T. Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary nominee, made major omissions about financial holdings. “It was game time and they walked up without any uniforms on and with no playbook,” Clay Johnson III, who directed George W. Bush’s transition effort in 2000, said about the initial vetting process by Mr. Trump’s administration. So far, nine of Mr. Trump’s nominees who require Senate confirmation have been approved. Eight years ago at this time, 12 of Barack Obama’s appointments had been confirmed, while 15 of Mr. Bush’s had been confirmed in 2001. Throughout his campaign, through the transition and in the early days of his presidency, Mr. Trump has often chosen to do things his own way, ignoring protocols. After his election, Mr. Trump held court at Trump Tower in Manhattan, and other Trump properties, meeting with job candidates and celebrating the selection of his cabinet and White House staff  —   but before the routine background scrubbing that typically occurs. In a significant omission, the new administration early on did not ask cabinet nominees and top White House officials to fill out the “sex, drugs and rock ’n’ roll” questionnaire that has become a routine part of the nomination process. The questionnaire was used by the past two administrations to help conduct the early vetting of potential cabinet nominees. In addition to trying to determine potential financial and professional conflicts of interest, the questions concern areas of potential blackmail, past criminal investigations, and whether taxes have been paid for nannies and hired help. The goal is to have the most serious issues facing a potential candidate figured out well before the F. B. I. conducts background checks and before financial disclosure statements are filed with the Office of Government Ethics. In recent weeks, the administration has made efforts to catch up. It has hired an ethics compliance team, including four lawyers working for Donald F. McGahn, White House counsel. And White House ethics officials have now begun circulating a new version of the questionnaire. The new form, unlike the previous one used by the Obama administration, asks nominees just one question about conflicts of interest and skips over queries about ties to corporations or investments in properties, according to a copy reviewed by The New York Times. The   form focuses mainly on questions of character and potential lawsuits that could arise from sexual and racial harassment claims. The White House did not respond to emails and calls requesting comment for this article. The Trump team’s approach of announce first, vet later has led to confusion, clearance delays and situations where candidates were unexpectedly thrust into a spotlight of public scrutiny. Already one prominent nominee, Vincent Viola, the candidate for secretary of the Army, has walked away after concluding that it would be an “insurmountable” task to disentangle himself from his many businesses. Nominees have been caught off guard by their need to sell or distance themselves from unusual holdings, like stakes in private equity and hedge funds, family trusts and even professional sports franchises to steer clear of conflicts before taking a government post. In the case of Wilbur L. Ross Jr. the billionaire and commerce secretary nominee, ethics monitors granted him twice the normal   period to sell off his assets, many of which are intimately tied up in private investment funds. Despite the vetting issues, few, if any of Mr. Trump’s cabinet nominees are expected to be rejected by the Senate. Some people close to the nomination process said that officials with the Office of Government Ethics, which works with nominees to decide how to deal with potential conflicts, lacked an understanding of some of the more sophisticated financial investments held by nominees, making the process more difficult. Compared with previous administrations, Mr. Trump’s government has more billionaires and multimillionaires. The transition from a national political campaign to taking over the White House is always a difficult one. A new team of people assumes unfamiliar levers of power, while also going on a hiring spree  —   installing dozens of   appointees and droves of underlings. In the case of the Trump administration, the transition was hampered by a management  . Mr. Trump appointed Chris Christie, New Jersey governor, as chairman of his transition months before Election Day, but decided to remove him and much of his team soon after his victory. The decision to oust Mr. Christie’s team, without quickly putting in place a new one, left the administration, which must still fill hundreds of top jobs, ill prepared for the nomination process. “The vetting process is designed to identify issues about fitness and confirmability prior to public announcement,” said Leslie B. Kiernan, a former deputy White House counsel for President Obama and now a partner with the law firm Akin Gump. The confirmation hearing for Mr. Puzder, the billionaire restaurant   to head the Labor Department, was postponed several times because of a delay in filing his financial disclosure statement. Mr. Puzder’s hearing is now scheduled for Thursday after the ethics office on Wednesday cleared his financial disclosure statement and ethics agreement. In the agreement, Mr. Puzder said that if confirmed, he would divest himself of his holdings in CKE Restaurants, the operator of the Hardee’s and Carl’s Jr.   chains that he heads. Todd Ricketts, the deputy commerce secretary nominee, has not had a confirmation hearing yet, even though he was announced by the Trump team on Nov. 30. Mr. Ricketts is the scion of a wealthy family and   of the Chicago Cubs. A letter on Feb. 7 to Mr. Ricketts by several Democratic senators asked him for more information about his political   activity. Despite the setbacks for Mr. Trump, the administration has had ample resources at its disposal. One bipartisan program, called the Center for Presidential Transition, met with the remaining campaigns in the spring to offer advice on a process it calls “big, complicated and dangerous. ” In the months before the election, the Office of Government Ethics also communicated with representatives for Mr. Trump. After his victory, the office offered to bring over supplies, including regulatory books and ethics guides, according to internal emails made public by the agency in response to records requests. But with the turnover at the Trump transition team in the wake of the election, the communication with the agency stopped. Walter M. Shaub Jr. director of the office, cautioned in a Nov. 18 email that cabinet nominees who did not make use of the office for prescreening posed “the risk of embarrassment for the  ” and his appointees. Mr. Shaub wrote in one email, “We seem to have lost contact with the   transition since the election. ” The messy start to the ethics process could still come back to haunt the administration. In 2000, when Mr. Bush faced a condensed timeline after the contested election in Florida, his team moved aggressively to minimize potential surprises, said Mr. Johnson, who was executive director of the transition. Their approach was to demand answers to the tough questions at the beginning of the process, before anyone was announced. “It becomes you tell us everything we need to know,” he said. “If you don’t tell us something, we drop you faster than a blink of an eye. ”	1

421	SAN FELIPE, Mexico  —   In the shallow sea waters of the Gulf of California swims a porpoise that few have seen, its numbers dwindling so fast that its very existence is now in peril. Known mostly by its Spanish name, the   vaquita is the world’s smallest cetacean, a miniature porpoise with a cartoonlike features and dark smudges around its eyes. The species lives only in the fertile waters of the gulf’s northern corner. The size of its population has always been precarious, but now voracious demand in China for a fish that shares the vaquita’s only habitat has pushed the tiny porpoise to the brink of extinction. No more than 30 vaquitas are left, according to a November estimate based on monitoring of their echolocation clicks. Half of the vaquitas counted a year earlier have disappeared. This calamity has hardly gone unnoticed. The vaquita has been vanishing in plain sight, to the despair of conservationists who have been advising the Mexican government on how to save it. All of the resources brought to bear, including the protection of the Mexican Navy, have proved to be no match against the illegal wildlife trade. “If we continue on the path we’re on, we’ll have no vaquitas in two years,” said Barbara Taylor, a marine mammal expert at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The vaquita are simply bycatch, trapped and drowned in curtains of illegal gillnets set for an endangered fish called the totoaba. The fish’s swim bladder is dried and smuggled to China, where wealthy diners pay thousands of dollars for the delicacy, believing it to have medicinal powers. To feed that appetite, totoaba poachers have killed 90 percent of the vaquita population since 2011, according to the acoustic monitoring program led by Armando Jaramillo Legorreta at the Mexican government’s National Ecology and Climate Change Institute, known as INECC. With so few vaquitas left, experts advising the Mexican government have proposed capturing several specimens and holding them in a sea pen as a way of conserving the species until the threat to its habitat is removed. It’s a   measure that conservationists had hoped they would never have to resort to. “We had always been opposed to captivity,” said Lorenzo Rojas Bracho, a marine mammal expert at INECC and the chairman of an advisory group, the International Committee for Vaquita Recovery. But nobody expected that the population would decline so quickly. “There are risks,” Dr. Rojas Bracho said of the capture plan. “But they are fewer than leaving them with the fishing as it is. ” The plan would entail training United States Navy dolphins to locate vaquitas, capturing them for transfer to a temporary pool and then to a sea pen to be built in their habitat along the Gulf of California coast. The majority of vaquitas would remain in the wild. But the unknowns loom large. “We don’t know whether they find them,” Dr. Taylor said of the dolphins. “We don’t know whether we can catch them. We don’t know how they will react. ” “If you get a negative result in any one of these steps,” she added, “it’s basically game over” for the capture plan. Even in the best of scenarios, breeding in captivity is unlikely to restore the population. A female vaquita gives birth to one calf every two years on average. If the proposal goes forward, the vaquita would join other species at the brink of extinction  —   like the California condor and the golden lion tamarin, in Brazil  —   that are being closely managed in some form distinct from their natural setting. It would be the first such effort for a marine mammal. A very small population can be pulled back from the edge, but “it requires    thinking,” said Samuel Turvey, a research fellow at the Zoological Society of London who studies conservation management for highly threatened species. A   plan designed with the expectation that the animals can eventually be returned to the wild “is not a permanent solution,” he added. “It’s an emergency stopgap with an exit strategy. ” Nor would it be a quick fix. “It requires intensive sustained efforts for decades to recover species from these catastrophic low levels,” said Richard Young, the head of conservation science at the Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust . Dr. Turvey speaks from experience. He witnessed the first   extinction of a cetacean, the Yangtze River dolphin. Like the vaquita, the baiji, as it was more commonly known, occupied a limited habitat in small numbers and was decimated as bycatch in local fisheries. For a decade, researchers discussed removing individual baiji to a   reserve as a   conservation measure. But when Dr. Turvey and other researchers led an expedition down the Yangtze in 2006 to look for specimens, they found none. The baiji “only became a story when it was gone,” he said, adding that “it was really dark and upsetting. ” It is an experience that Dr. Taylor, who was on the expedition, hopes not to repeat. “It’s idealistic to think that we’re going to effect the significant changes in fisheries and enforcement practices in the wild in time to save vaquitas,” she said. If anything, those efforts have reached a nadir. Two years ago, the Mexican government imposed a   ban on all gillnets across 5, 000 square miles of the vaquita habitat and sent its Navy to enforce it. To support the communities of the upper Gulf, which depend on fishing and shrimping, the government allocated $74 million in compensation over the two years. The hope was that the military could halt the totoaba trade and that two years would be long enough to complete development of   trawl nets to substitute for shrimp gillnets. (Even before the totoaba trade surged, legal gillnet fishing had depleted the vaquita population.) But local fishermen argue that the new nets’ catches are too meager to provide a living, and the authorities have been sympathetic. “While there is no alternative to fishing practices, nobody will give up their gillnets,” Dr. Rojas Bracho said. The promised enforcement also has fallen short. That was evident this month aboard the Sam Simon, a   antipoaching vessel operated by the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, an environmental organization. In an agreement with the Mexican Navy, Sea Shepherd has been patrolling the vaquita habitat, pulling illegal nets out of the water and spotting poachers. “We see illegal activity almost every day,” said Oona Layolle, the leader of the Sea Shepherd campaign, called Operation Milagro (Spanish for “miracle”). At about 4 p. m. one afternoon this month, a fishing boat pulled up just a few hundred meters from the Sam Simon carrying four men guided by a   GPS device. One of the men dragged a hook in the water, looking for a gillnet they had hidden there. The Sam Simon sent a drone over the small boat and it sped off, only to return with six men aboard, who threw objects at the drone before leaving again. Despite a call to the Mexican Navy, nobody came. Even when arrests are made, conservationists say, the prosecution is too slapdash to win a conviction for a serious crime. Last year, Mexican Navy patrols succeeded in scaring off the totoaba poachers by day, forcing them to haul in their nets at night. But this year, the poachers work openly during the day, some wearing balaclavas, apparently undeterred by desultory government patrols. Some poachers even post photos of their weapons on Facebook. At the same time, four boats belonging to Mexico’s environmental prosecutor are parked on a side street running above the dock here, their motors broken or simply unused because fuel is in short supply. The nets tell a similar tale. Over 10 weeks last spring, Operation Milagro pulled 42 totoaba nets from these waters. In the fall, a broad   survey succeeded in finding 36 totoaba nets, 28 of which were in use. In   Operation Milgro resumed and found 56 more totoaba nets in nine weeks. Almost all were new, and some were set in the same places that the government effort had cleared just weeks earlier. During night patrol aboard the Sam Simon last week, the crew pulled up yet another totoaba net of wide blue mesh, its unweathered red buoys evidence that the net was brand new. “The situation is so dramatic that we have to take huge measures,” Ms. Layolle said. “It is a desperate time. ” Mexico’s environment minister, Rafael Pacchiano Alamán, promised this month to send 45 federal police officers to patrol the beaches and to dismantle poachers’ camps. But he did not respond to the main recommendation of conservationists: a permanent gillnet ban. The legal fishing season for corvina has begun, which usually means that dozens of small boats are on the water, giving cover to poachers. But this year the Mexican government has so far declined to grant any fishing permits. Despite a promise last year by President Enrique Peña Nieto, the government has yet to act on the gillnet ban. Without that, warn conservationists, there is no way to begin to save the vaquita. “If you can’t remove the threats, the population keeps declining,” Dr. Turvey said. “You don’t have time for complacency. ”	1
175	ISLAMABAD, Pakistan  —   A suicide bomber turned a spiritual dance celebration at a revered religious shrine into a slaughterhouse on Thursday, killing at least 70 people and wounding more than 250 in the worst act of terrorism to hit Pakistan in months. At least 50 of the wounded were critically hurt in the explosion at the Sufi shrine in a remote part of southern Pakistan, officials said. Many of the victims were women. The Islamic State, the extreme Sunni militant organization based in Syria and Iraq, announced that its branch in the region had carried out the attack. The Islamic State, which regards members of other Muslim groups as nonbelievers deserving death, also claimed responsibility for an attack on a Sufi shrine in southwestern Pakistan in November. Sufism, popular in Pakistan, is regarded as a relatively tolerant branch of Islam. The shrine assault on Thursday was by far the worst in a wave of militant attacks that have shaken Pakistan this week, most claimed by the Taliban. The attacks were the catalyst for a decision on Thursday by the armed forces to close the border with Afghanistan, where Pakistani officials claim that many such attacks are coordinated and plotted. A spokesman for the armed forces, Maj. Gen. Asif Ghafoor, announced on Twitter that the border closing was effective immediately. While Pakistani officials have voiced skepticism about the presence of the Islamic State in the country, they have acknowledged that some local militant groups have expressed support for it. The attacks have underscored the challenges faced by the civil and military leadership to counter extremist violence. On Wednesday, seven people were killed in northwestern Pakistan in two suicide bombings, one targeting judges in Peshawar, the provincial capital of the northwestern   Province. On Monday, at least 13 people were killed in Lahore, in the east, when militants targeted a protest. The bombing Thursday evening targeted the shrine of Lal Shahbaz Qalandar, a popular Sufi saint, in Sehwan, a city in Jamshoro district of the southern Sindh Province. A large number of people had been performing a spiritual, devotional dance when the bomber struck in the courtyard, officials said, turning a place of spiritual reverie into a spectacle of blood and body parts. The remoteness of the region added to the difficulties faced by the survivors and emergency responders. The nearest big city was about 90 miles away. Khadim Hussain Rind, a senior provincial police officer, said that more than two dozen police officials had been deputized for security at the event and that   cameras had been installed for surveillance of the shrine. “However, it is very difficult to stop a suicide bomber in a big crowd,” Mr. Rind told the local news media. Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif condemned the bombing as an assault on a “progressive inclusive future of Pakistan. ” Sufi shrines and mosques have been targeted in the past by Taliban militants, who view Sufi Islam as contrary to their beliefs. “The past few days have been hard, and my heart is with the victims,” the prime minister said in the statement. “But we can’t let these events divide us, or scare us. We must stand united in this struggle for the Pakistani identity and universal humanity. ” The sudden spike in terrorist violence has shocked and surprised the country. “Pakistan is under attack. The terrorists are creating a climate of fear, intimidation and uncertainty. No institution and no aspect of society is seemingly secure,” Syeda Sughra Imam, a former senator, said in an interview. “Sehwan is synonymous with Pakistan’s Sufi culture and tradition, which has been dealt a devastating blow today. ” The Pakistani military had proudly claimed last year, under the leadership of the then army chief, that the military operations in the tribal regions, especially the one in North Waziristan, and intelligence operations in different cities had largely defeated the militant groups that had carried out many attacks. But the violence has cast doubt on the military’s claims. Imran Khan, the prominent opposition politician, blamed the federal government for what he called its failure to follow through after the military’s offensives against militants. “We need a coherent national security policy,” Mr. Khan said in an interview. “I do think complacency has set in,” Mr. Khan said.	1
847	   Is this fake news? Sarah Palin Calls For Re-Introducing Slavery On Voluntary Basis.   Sarah Palin, who is known to have an opinion on every matter, spoke to Newslo exclusively and stated that “it seems like [Tony Evans of the Urban Alternative ministry] has got it all figured out. So, I’d like to offer my advice and support in realizing his ideas.”“When slavery was first abolished, to say that that was a radical change would be an understatement,” Palin said. “In fact, it’s a historical one. So, today, when everything everybody seems to be talking about are illegal immigrants and their status, maybe it’s time to make another equally radical — no, scratch that — historical change that would bring the attention of the public back to the real problem — the black community in the US.”Asked to further elaborate, Palin openly said: “What I’m talking about is realizing the pastor’s idea somewhat indirectly — bringing back slavery, only this time making it voluntary. That way, the people would be able to have the best of both worlds. On one hand, black families would become as strong as before, and on the other, it would reduce pressure on the already tense relationship between white people and the black community, not to mention that it would put down the racial fires all across the US once and for all.” Newslo is the first hybrid News/Satire platform on the web.

24	ROME  —   Those trying to divine the roots of Stephen K. Bannon’s dark and at times apocalyptic worldview have repeatedly combed over a speech that Mr. Bannon, President Trump’s ideological guru, made in 2014 to a Vatican conference, where he expounded on Islam, populism and capitalism. But for all the examination of those remarks, a passing reference by Mr. Bannon to an esoteric Italian philosopher has gone little noticed, except perhaps by scholars and followers of the deeply taboo,   thinker, Julius Evola. “The fact that Bannon even knows Evola is significant,” said Mark Sedgwick, a leading scholar of Traditionalists at Aarhus University in Denmark. Evola, who died in 1974, wrote on everything from Eastern religions to the metaphysics of sex to alchemy. But he is best known as a leading proponent of Traditionalism, a worldview popular in   and alternative religious circles that believes progress and equality are poisonous illusions. Evola became a darling of Italian Fascists, and Italy’s   terrorists of the 1960s and 1970s looked to him as a spiritual and intellectual godfather. They called themselves Children of the Sun after Evola’s vision of a   new order that he called the Solar Civilization. Today, the Greek   party Golden Dawn includes his works on its suggested reading list, and the leader of Jobbik, the Hungarian nationalist party, admires Evola and wrote an introduction to his works. More important for the current American administration, Evola also caught on in the United States with leaders of the   movement, which Mr. Bannon nurtured as the head of Breitbart News and then helped harness for Mr. Trump. “Julius Evola is one of the most fascinating men of the 20th century,” said Richard Spencer, the white nationalist leader who is a top figure in the   movement, which has attracted white supremacists, racists and   elements. In the days after the election, Mr. Spencer led a Washington   conference in chants of “Hail Trump!” But he also invoked Evola’s idea of a prehistoric and   spirituality  —   referring to the awakening of whites, whom he called the Children of the Sun. Mr. Spencer said “it means a tremendous amount” that Mr. Bannon was aware of Evola and other Traditionalist thinkers. “Even if he hasn’t fully imbibed them and been changed by them, he is at least open to them,” he said. “He at least recognizes that they are there. That is a stark difference to the American conservative movement that either was ignorant of them or attempted to suppress them. ” Mr. Bannon, who did not return a request for comment for this article, is an avid and   reader. He has spoken enthusiastically about everything from Sun Tzu’s “The Art of War” to “The Fourth Turning” by William Strauss and Neil Howe, which sees history in cycles of cataclysmic and   change. His awareness of and reference to Evola in itself only reflects that reading. But some on the   consider Mr. Bannon a door through which Evola’s ideas of a hierarchical society run by a spiritually superior caste can enter in a period of crisis. “Evolists view his ship as coming in,” said Prof. Richard Drake at the University of Montana, who wrote about Evola in his book “The Revolutionary Mystique and Terrorism in Contemporary Italy. ” For some of them, it has been a long time coming. “It’s the first time that an adviser to the American president knows Evola, or maybe has a Traditionalist formation,” said Gianfranco De Turris, an Evola biographer and apologist based in Rome who runs the Evola Foundation out of his apartment. “If Bannon has these ideas, we have to see how he influences the politics of Trump,” he said. A March article titled “An Establishment Conservative’s Guide to the  ” in Breitbart, the website then run by Mr. Bannon, included Evola as one of the thinkers in whose writings the “origins of the alternative right” could be found. The article was   by Milo Yiannopoulos, the   provocateur who is wildly popular with conservatives on college campuses. Mr. Trump recently defended Mr. Yiannopoulos as a symbol of free speech after demonstrators violently protested his planned speech at the University of California, Berkeley. The article celebrated the youthful internet trolls who give the   movement its energy and who, motivated by a common and questionable sense of humor, use   and racially charged memes “in typically juvenile but undeniably hysterical fashion. ” “It’s hard to imagine them reading Evola,” the article continued. “They may be inclined to sympathize to those causes, but mainly because it annoys the right people. ” Evola, who has more than annoyed people for nearly a century, seems to be having a moment. “When I started working on Evola, you had to plow through Italian,” said Mr. Sedgwick, who keeps track of Traditionalist movements and thought on his blog, Traditionalists. “Now he’s available in English, German, Russian, Serbian, Greek, Hungarian. First I saw Evola boom, and then I realized the number of people interested in that sort of idea was booming. ” Born in 1898, Evola liked to call himself a baron and in later life sported a monocle in his left eye. A brilliant student and talented artist, he came home after fighting in World War I and became a leading exponent in Italy of the Dada movement, which, like Evola, rejected the church and bourgeois institutions. Evola’s early artistic endeavors gave way to his love of the German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche, and he developed a worldview with an overriding animosity toward the decadence of modernity. Influenced by mystical works and the occult, Evola began developing an idea of the individual’s ability to transcend his reality and “be unconditionally whatever one wants. ” Under the influence of René Guénon, a French metaphysicist and convert to Islam, Evola in 1934 published his most influential work, “The Revolt Against the Modern World,” which cast materialism as an eroding influence on ancient values. It viewed humanism, the Renaissance, the Protestant Reformation and the French Revolution all as historical disasters that took man further away from a transcendental perennial truth. Changing the system, Evola argued, was “not a question of contesting and polemicizing, but of blowing everything up. ” Evola’s ideal order, Professor Drake wrote, was based on “hierarchy, caste, monarchy, race, myth, religion and ritual. ” That made a fan out of Benito Mussolini. The dictator already admired Evola’s early writings on race, which influenced the 1938 Racial Laws restricting the rights of Jews in Italy. Mussolini so liked Evola’s 1941 book, “Synthesis on the Doctrine of Race,” which advocated a form of spiritual, and not merely biological, racism, that he invited Evola to meet him in September of that year. Evola eventually broke with Mussolini and the Italian Fascists because he considered them overly tame and corrupted by compromise. Instead he preferred the Nazi SS officers, seeing in them something closer to a mythic ideal. They also shared his  . Mr. Bannon suggested in his Vatican remarks that the Fascist movement had come out of Evola’s ideas. As Mr. Bannon expounded on the intellectual motivations of the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin, he mentioned “Julius Evola and different writers of the early 20th century who are really the supporters of what’s called the Traditionalist movement, which really eventually metastasized into Italian Fascism. ” The reality, historians say, is that Evola sought to “infiltrate and influence” the Fascists, as Mr. Sedgwick put it, as a powerful vehicle to spread his ideas. In his Vatican talk, Mr. Bannon suggested that although Mr. Putin represented a “kleptocracy,” the Russian president understood the existential danger posed by “a potential new caliphate” and the importance of using nationalism to stand up for traditional institutions. “We, the   West,” Mr. Bannon added, “really have to look at what he’s talking about as far as Traditionalism goes  —   particularly the sense of where it supports the underpinnings of nationalism. ” As Mr. Bannon suggested in his speech, Mr. Putin’s most influential thinker is Aleksandr Dugin, the ultranationalist Russian Traditionalist and   writer sometimes called “Putin’s Rasputin. ” An intellectual descendant of Evola, Mr. Dugin has called for a “genuine, true, radically revolutionary, and consistent fascist fascism” and advocated a   theory of “Eurasianism”  —   which has provided a philosophical framework for Mr. Putin’s expansionism and meddling in Western European politics. Mr. Dugin sees European Traditionalists as needing Russia, and Mr. Putin, to defend them from the onslaught of Western liberal democracy, individual liberty, and materialism  —   all Evolian bêtes noires. This appeal of traditional values on populist voters and against    elites, the “  Union” and “centralized government in the United States,” as Mr. Bannon put it, was not lost on Mr. Trump’s ideological guru. “A lot of people that are Traditionalists,” he said in his Vatican remarks, “are attracted to that. ”	1

186	LOS ANGELES  —   Smiling and clapping through marathon   awards banquets. Week after week, month after month. Racking up   miles (New York to Los Angeles to London to Los Angeles) to woo Oscar voters at    sessions. Giving endless command performances to   reporters who ask the same five (three?) questions on loop. All the hair and makeup. All the gown fittings. And losing the whole time. Nicole Kidman, Naomie Harris, Michelle Williams and Octavia Spencer  —   each nominated for best supporting actress at the coming Academy Awards  —   know this drill all too well: It has been their lives (boohoo, I know) since November, when their fellow nominee, Viola Davis, started to vacuum up prize after prize for her    performance in “Fences. ” All told, Ms. Davis, who plays a   homemaker in 1950s Pittsburgh, has collected at least 29 trophies in recent months. (“Thank you to the Iowa Film Critics Association! ”) She walked to bellwether wins at the Golden Globes, the British Academy of Film and Television Arts and the Screen Actors Guild. The oddsmakers at GoldDerby. com have her seizing the supporting actress Oscar in a landslide on Feb. 26. It’s the most   category there is: She’s winning. So why do the other contenders keep going through the motions? That question pops into my head almost every year around this time, when the gracious losing starts to seem like   performance art unto itself.   reporters do their best to keep the Academy Awards feeling like a contest, but at least one category is perennially no contest at all. In 2015, Julianne Moore won best actress on the September day when Hollywood insiders first saw her in “Still Alice” at the Toronto International Film Festival. In 2012, Ms. Spencer similarly breezed to the Oscar lectern, collecting the supporting actress statuette for her portrayal of a maid in “The Help,” in which she starred with Ms. Davis. For answers, I spoke to longtime studio executives, publicists, agents and even a few of this year’s   nominees. And some of their responses were surprising. Joe Quenqua, who runs the entertainment practice at DKC Marketing and Public Relations, cleared up one thing right off the bat: No nominees, no matter what they say, concede they are losing until that golden envelope has been opened. “You can be the longest shot in the history of Oscar nominees,” he said. “You still have to think you have the teeniest, tiniest,    chance of winning walking into that room. ” Mr. Quenqua, who has worked on numerous Oscar campaigns, including one for “The Help,” said that there are multiple reasons that   contenders cling to hope. Aside from ego  —   and don’t underestimate that factor in Hollywood  —   actors and actresses, from their earliest days auditioning, don’t make it very far if they have a defeatist attitude. Upsets from past Oscars can also contribute to magical thinking nobody thought voters would select Marisa Tomei as best supporting actress in 1993 for her   girlfriend in “My Cousin Vinny,” but they did. And reporters may play a role. “It’s not like journalists single out the long shots and say, ‘Tell me how it feels to be losing,’” Mr. Quenqua said. “Instead, the question asked to everyone is always, ‘What are you saying in your acceptance speech? ’” Guilty as charged. Every year, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences hosts a luncheon a few weeks before its prize ceremony to celebrate all the nominees as a group, from major stars down to the sound mixers. The academy peppers the room with reporters. Since the event usually falls at a crucial time in the voting process  —   this year, a few days before ballots went out  —   nominees tend to be very chatty. One of my first stops was Ms. Harris, who played a   mother in “Moonlight” and is vying for best supporting actress against Ms. Davis. “Do you plan to write an acceptance speech?” I asked her. Ms. Harris smiled. “I’m going with Helen Mirren’s advice, which is to always have a speech, even if you know beyond a doubt that you’re not going to win,” she said. I knew I was pushing it, but I said it anyway: “How do you know that?” With a single facial expression, she seemed to toss all 29 of Ms. Davis’s trophies in my direction. In the end, the affable Ms. Harris offered some insight into how she has approached the Year of Viola Davis, who has never won an Oscar despite two prior nominations (for “The Help” and for “Doubt” in 2009) making her the most nominated black actress in academy history. “I’m so grateful for the acknowledgment, which has made a huge difference in my career already, in terms of scripts and projects coming to me  —   it’s quite extraordinary, actually  —   but I’m also happy to be able to come to these events and help get ‘Moonlight’ to a broader audience,” Ms. Harris said. “I feel a responsibility to get out there and do as much legwork as I can to promote the film. ” Perhaps her category mates had similar points of view. Ms. Kidman, nominated for her   adoptive mother in “Lion,” has certainly done her best, dating back to the September film festivals, to keep that     in the public eye. Ditto Ms. Williams, nominated for her heartbroken mother in “Manchester by the Sea. ” Before I could track them down, I stumbled across Ms. Spencer, honored for playing a NASA leader in “Hidden Figures. ” She caught my eye partly because she was not aggressively working the   room. “Can I ask you a question?” I said to her, after identifying myself as a reporter. “No,” she said, sitting down at her lunch table. Now it was my turn to make a face. “Well, you can ask me how my day is going,” she said quickly. “But I’m not doing any press. ” Maybe she just wanted to be left alone with her salad. Maybe she was worried that I might drag her into yet another discussion about the #OscarSoWhite controversy. Or maybe, just then, she had stopped going through the motions.	1

403	WASHINGTON  —   President Trump put both political parties on notice Monday that he intends to slash spending on many of the federal government’s most politically sensitive programs  —   relating to education, the environment, science and poverty  —   to protect the economic security of retirees and to shift billions more to the armed forces. The proposal to increase military spending by $54 billion and cut nonmilitary programs by the same amount was unveiled by White House officials as they prepared the president’s plans for next year’s federal budget. Aides to the president said final decisions about Medicare and Social Security would not be made until later in the year, when he announces his full budget. But Sean Spicer, his spokesman, cited Mr. Trump’s campaign commitments about protecting those programs and vowed that “he’s going to keep his word to the American people. ” In effect, Mr. Trump appears determined to take sides in a generational struggle between older, sicker Americans who depend on the entitlement programs, and their younger, poorer counterparts whose livelihoods are shaped by the domestic programs likely to see steep cuts. He also set up a battle for control of Republican Party ideology with House Speaker Paul D. Ryan, who for years has staked his   reputation on the argument that taming the budget deficit without tax increases would require that Congress change, and cut, the programs that swallow the bulk of the government’s spending  —   Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. “I don’t know how you take $54 billion out without wholesale taking out entire departments,” said Bill Hoagland, a longtime Republican budget aide in the Senate and now a senior vice president at the Bipartisan Policy Center. “You need to control it in the area of the entitlement programs, which he’s taken off the table. It is a proposal, I dare say, that will be dead on arrival even with a Republican Congress. ” Speaking to governors at the White House, Mr. Trump said his spending demands would be at the core of the speech he gives Tuesday night to a joint session of Congress. “This budget follows through on my promise to keep Americans safe,” he said, calling it a “public safety and national security” budget that will send a “message to the world in these dangerous times of American strength, security and resolve. ” In the first part of the speech, Mr. Trump will recount “promises made and promises kept,” said the aides, who requested anonymity during a briefing with reporters. The rest of the speech will focus on how he will help people with their problems and how he intends to protect the nation. The president’s budget proposals  —   which were short on detail but are said to exempt not just Medicare and Social Security but also veterans’ benefits and law enforcement efforts  —   would lead to deep reductions in federal programs that touch millions of lives. The White House signaled that it would begin with agencies like the Environmental Protection Agency, the Internal Revenue Service and social   programs. A budget with no entitlement cuts and one that does not balance most likely has no chance of passing the House, and could be rejected by Senate Republicans as well. Mr. Trump’s proposals are too far to the right in terms of domestic cuts and too far to the left in terms of balance. Their failure could have practical implications for the White House. If Congress fails to pass a budget blueprint for the fiscal year that begins in October, Mr. Trump’s promise to drastically rewrite the tax code could also die, since the president was counting on that budget resolution to include special parliamentary language that would shield his tax cuts from a Democratic filibuster. Without it, any tax legislation would have to be bipartisan enough to clear the Senate with 60 votes. But beyond legislative considerations, the fate of Mr. Trump’s proposal will go a long way toward determining how significantly his brand of economic populism has changed Republican orthodoxy. Mr. Trump repeatedly said during the campaign that Republican promises to transform Medicare and slash entitlement spending were the reason the party lost the White House in 2012, helpfully   Mr. Ryan, who sat at the bottom of the ticket that year, in his analysis. Social Security, health care and net interest now comprise nearly 60 percent of all federal spending, and that figure is expected to soar to 82 percent over the next 10 years. “Paul Ryan’s budget plans with cuts to Social Security and Medicare are not that popular with most voters, and what helped elect Donald Trump was the promise not to cut benefits and programs,” said Douglas Elmendorf, the recently departed director of the Congressional Budget Office and current dean of Harvard’s John F. Kennedy School of Government. “That is an unresolved tension. ” White House officials said the broad outlines of a spending plan represented the logical culmination of Mr. Trump’s efforts to make good on his campaign pledges to prune what he considers wasteful government spending even as he expands what he considers an underfunded military. “It will show the president is keeping his promises and doing exactly what he said he was going to do,” said Mick Mulvaney, the president’s budget director. “We are taking his words and turning them into policies and dollars. ” Mr. Trump’s advisers said aid to foreign governments, which makes up a tiny fraction of federal spending, was one such target. The budget for the I. R. S. which was the target of Republican criticism during Barack Obama’s administration, would be slashed by 14 percent, according to documents obtained by The New York Times. The Community Development Financial Institutions Fund, which provides grants for community banks and local development, would be all but eliminated. The White House blueprint calls for a 24 percent cut to the E. P. A. ’s budget, according to a person who had seen the document but was not authorized to speak on the record. That would amount to a reduction of about $2 billion from the agency’s annual budget of about $8. 1 billion, reducing its spending to levels not seen since Ronald Reagan’s presidency. But it is far from clear whether Congress will approve such steep cuts in popular programs. While congressional Republicans have long targeted the E. P. A. ’s regulatory authority, they are also aware that about half the agency’s annual budget is passed through to popular   programs, like converting abandoned industrial sites into sports stadiums and other public facilities, which lawmakers of both parties are loath to cut. And most of the agency’s federal office spending goes toward funding programs that are required by existing laws. Last year, even as congressional Republicans railed against the Obama administration’s E. P. A. regulations, they proposed cutting only $291 million from the agency’s budget. Environmental advocates denounced the proposed cuts, saying they would devastate environmental protection and public health programs while doing little to increase national security. “The assault on human health begins now with President Trump’s plan to slash the E. P. A. ’s resources, which are vital to protecting Americans’ drinking water and air from pollution,” said Scott Faber, vice president of government affairs at the Environmental Working Group. But the information to emerge about the budget raises more questions than it answers. Democrats, of course, will be no friend, either. “Democrats will make crystal clear the misplaced priorities of the administration and the Republican majority,” said Representative Nita M. Lowey of New York, the   Democrat on the Appropriations Committee, “and we will fight tooth and nail to protect services and investments that are critical to   American families and communities across the country. ” But the budget may be the most striking example in Mr. Trump’s young presidency of the ways in which he is challenging the orthodoxy of his own party. Since the start of his insurgent campaign, Mr. Trump has opposed the Republican Party’s   positions on a range of policies, including free trade, how to deal with Russia and the future of government entitlement programs. Republicans in Congress had hoped that the influence of the two former Republican House members in Mr. Trump’s cabinet  —   Tom Price, head of health and human services, and Mr. Mulvaney  —   would have led to new conclusions about the need to address entitlement programs that are swelling drastically with baby boomers’ retirement. Instead, Mr. Trump appears intent on extracting the savings he needs for military spending from the one part of the budget already most squeezed, domestic discretionary spending.	1

619	 Sharon Krueger, 36, was arrested yesterday after she was caught masturbating at a McDonald’s Play Place using her son’s Transformer Happy Meal toy. Her lewd conduct left patrons and children at the restaurant in dismay, causing mass panic.Sharon Krueger was witnessed by several customers and their children, sexually please herself inside the ball pit at the McDonald’s Play Place. The incident occurred around 6 p.m. yesterday according to reports. Krueger had taken her 6-year-old son, Daniel Krueger, to the restaurant to get him dinner. Afterwards, she left her son at the table to eat as she went to the restroom. According to eyewitnesses her 6-year-old son was crying because he was unable to locate his Transformers Happy Meal toy. Another parent at the restaurant approached the young boy and asked him if he knew where his mother was. The child told her that his mom had went to the restroom.“One of our customers came up to the register and informed us that a young boy was crying because he didn’t have his Happy Meal toy and that his mother was in the restroom,” said Karen Boyd, an employee of the McDonald’s location. “I grabbed two Happy Meal toys and took them over to the young kid and apologized for his Happy Meal not having the Transformers toy. The young boy thanked me and then asked if I could get his mom because he was ready to leave. I went to the ladies restroom and called for Ms. Krueger but no one answered. I checked the stalls and no one was inside the restroom. I went back to the register and called Ms. Krueger over the loudspeaker and let her know that her son was ready to leave. After about 10 minutes of waiting, I went into the Play Place area to see if she was there possibly looking for her son. When I went inside, I saw the most disgusting conduct from a parent ever in my life. The woman had almost the entire body of Optimus Prime inside of her.” Boyd added.	0

According to legend, the temple was designed that way to honor the days of the ancient ruler’s coronation and his birthday with sunlight. But if the legend’s true, then the light has been arriving a day late for several decades. In the 1960s, the    temple was moved inland to save it from rising water levels caused by the Aswan Dam.

He was referring to the scores of carved baboons at the temple’s entrance, which are shown barking at the rising sun. The move pushed back, by a day, the arrival of sunlight to the inner sanctum.

404	WASHINGTON  —   President Trump’s proposal to add $54 billion to the Pentagon budget next year sounds huge at first  —   a 10 percent increase for a department that already receives more of taxpayers’ money than any other part of government. But the outgoing Obama administration had forecast a $35 billion increase for the Defense Department in fiscal year 2018, so Mr. Trump’s share of the proposed increase over and above that figure is $19 billion, according to budget analysts. Even so, the proposed Pentagon increase has been greeted with criticism from military spending hawks, in part because White House officials say Mr. Trump will call for a significant cut in foreign aid, including programs that military officials say contribute to global stability and are seen as important in helping avoid future conflicts. Senior administration officials acknowledged on Monday that there were few specifics attached to the bigger budget number proposed for the Pentagon  —   so it is not yet possible to assess how many more troops, warships or   the Pentagon will be able to field with the $54 billion. “Where we’re at in this process is that the number’s going to the D. O. D. today, and over the course of the next 10 days to two weeks, we’ll be coming up with those types of details,” Mick Mulvaney, the president’s budget director, said when pressed on plans for Department of Defense spending. Broadly speaking, Mr. Trump has said his military priorities include buying more warships and warplanes, increasing the number of American ground troops and modernizing the nuclear arsenal. Even so, he will face difficulty in getting such a proposal through Congress, where the threat of mandatory spending cuts known as sequestration has acted as a brake on military spending. “This is a symbolic gesture,” said Todd Harrison, the director of defense budget analysis at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “What Trump is proposing is increasing defense spending and paying for it by cutting nondefense spending. There’s no way Democrats are going to go for that. ” Under sequestration rules, Republicans would need Democrats to increase the military budget, a requirement that is likely to stymie Republican efforts to pay for increases in the Pentagon budget with cuts in other spending, including social programs. At the Defense Department, where military leaders always welcome more money, officials were muted about Mr. Trump’s budget proposal. What is more, Mr. Trump joined his call for increased military spending with a critique of the military, implying that the nation’s armed forces need more money because they have failed at winning wars. “We have to start winning wars again,” Mr. Trump said. “I have to say, when I was young, in high school and college, everybody used to say we never lost a war. We never lost a war, remember?” He continued: “And now we never win a war. We never win. And don’t fight to win. We don’t fight to win. We’ve either got to win or don’t fight at all. ” Mr. Trump was born in 1946, the year after World War II ended. The only wars fought when he was young were not American victories  —   he was 7 when the Korean War ended in a stalemate, and he was in college when American forces were bogged down in Vietnam. When he was in his 40s and 50s, the United States conducted a successful military operation in Panama, reversed Iraq’s invasion and occupation of Kuwait, and drove Serbian forces out of Kosovo. But Mr. Trump was channeling public exhaustion after more than 15 years of warfare since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, including the still unresolved conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq. Mr. Trump gave no indication of how he would have ensured victory in either of those places or what he planned to do. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis briefed the president’s team on Monday on potential strategies for defeating the Islamic State, which has operated in Iraq and Syria. Still, even the wars believed to be outright American victories by the public are not necessarily so, according to Andrew Exum, a retired Army Ranger and a Defense Department official in the Obama administration. “Those victories were not as decisive as we remember: It took another 100 years, after the civil rights acts of the 1960s, before the North truly won the Civil War, while the peace that ended the First World War begat the Second World War, and the peace that ended the Second World War begat the Cold War and its many constituent conflicts,” Mr. Exum said. “What Trump is saying resonates because it’s based more on the myths we tell ourselves than the histories written down in long, dense books. ” Former and current American military officials agreed. “The wars today don’t deliver battlefield victories along the lines of what we saw in World War II, with the surrender on the deck of the battleship Missouri,” said David W. Barno, a retired Army lieutenant general and former commander of American forces in Afghanistan. “We’re fighting enemies with no navies, no air forces or even conventional armies in some cases. Applying only conventional armed forces to these conflicts is not always going to be adequate. ” Several former Pentagon officials, including a number of retired generals and admirals, cautioned against cutting the State Department and foreign aid budgets to help pay for increases in Pentagon spending. In a letter to top congressional leaders, the retired military officers wrote that “elevating and strengthening diplomacy and development alongside defense are critical to keeping America safe. ” “We know from our service in uniform that many of the crises our nation faces do not have military solutions alone,” the generals and admirals wrote. “The military will lead the fight against terrorism on the battlefield, but it needs strong civilian partners in the battle against the drivers of extremism  —   lack of opportunity, insecurity, injustice and hopelessness. ” James G. Stavridis, a retired admiral who signed the letter, said on Monday that most senior military leaders believed it was unwise to cut development aid and diplomacy funding. “So often, the far less expensive ‘soft power’ tools  —   humanitarian relief, medical diplomacy, foreign aid, strategic communications  —   are under sister agencies such as state and A. I. D. ,” said Mr. Stavridis, a former NATO commander who now serves as the dean of the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University, referring to the State Department and the Agency for International Development. “Cutting them harshly would be a mistake. ” Even Mr. Mattis expressed those views before being named defense secretary. “If you don’t fully fund the State Department, then I need to buy more ammunition,” he said during congressional testimony in 2013, when he was head of the military’s Central Command. Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona and the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, recently released a report calling for an increase in military spending to $640 billion in the next fiscal year, not the $603 billion that Mr. Trump proposed. In a statement on Monday, Mr. McCain said Mr. Trump’s proposal was insufficient. “With a world on fire, America cannot secure peace through strength with just 3 percent more than President Obama’s budget,” Mr. McCain said. “We can and must do better. ” After the Pentagon budget number was released on Monday, the stocks of the largest military contractors rose 1 percent to 2 percent during trading. Lockheed Martin, Boeing, General Dynamics and Northrop Grumman, which pay relatively high dividends, had already seen their stocks rise to record levels in a rally that began last summer. Investors will now want to see how any budget increases would be divided among weapons programs to determine which companies would benefit the most.	1
127	LIMA, Peru  —   A former Peruvian president is a fugitive, charged with taking bribes. In Colombia, prosecutors say its president’s   campaign accepted dirty money. And intelligence agents in Venezuela arrested journalists and researchers looking into scandals there. Latin America’s biggest corruption scandal is shaking the continent’s political establishment. It can all be traced back to Odebrecht, the Brazilian construction company, which has built major projects throughout the region and late last year settled with the United States, Brazil and Switzerland for up to $4. 5 billion under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act for an elaborate bribe scheme involving $800 million in payoffs in exchange for lucrative contracts. It was the largest anticorruption settlement in history. Prosecutors said the company paid bribes on 100 projects in more than a dozen countries, from Mexico to Angola, in one case buying a local bank branch to hide the transactions, and even opening a division specifically dedicated to payoffs. Throughout Latin America, the company built bridges, dams, power plants, roads and stretches of a highway to link Brazil and Peru that went more than four times over budget. Nearly three years of investigations have resulted in 77 Brazilian Odebrecht executives signing plea deals, and the company’s former chief executive, Marcelo Odebrecht, is in prison. Now the charges are cascading across the region. “Once you start opening these cases, it’s a Pandora’s box  —   it could go on for years,” said Shannon K. O’Neil, an analyst at the Council on Foreign Relations. Yet she called it a positive development for the region, showing “the anticorruption movement in Latin America is gaining ground. ” Perhaps the most spectacular case so far involves Alejandro Toledo, the president of Peru from 2001 to 2006, and a wanted man since a judge issued an arrest warrant last week on charges that he had accepted up to $35 million in bribes. Mr. Toledo’s whereabouts was unknown, and Peruvians have been captivated. On Sunday night, he surfaced on Twitter, where he posted a statement attesting to his innocence and denied that he was hiding out. “I never fled from anything. When I left Peru, there were no Odebrecht charges against me, but they call me a ‘fugitive,’ ” he wrote, saying nothing of his location. The current Peruvian president, Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, has asked President Trump to extradite Mr. Toledo should he be found in the United States. In Lima, the capital, the legacy of Odebrecht is hard to miss. A statue of Christ with arms outspread that overlooks the city’s coast was donated by the company. But Odebrecht has also reaped the benefits of its connections to the country. The Interoceanic Highway, for example, begun under Mr. Toledo’s administration, cost $4. 5 billion, four times over budget. The overruns were approved by an official who is also under investigation by prosecutors. Under Ollanta Humala, Mr. Kuczynski’s predecessor, Odebrecht began a   $7 billion natural gas pipeline to connect the Amazon to the coast by cutting through the Andes Mountains. Another former president, Alan García, oversaw the bidding for a subway line in Lima, which Odebrecht won and constructed. If Mr. Toledo is apprehended and convicted, he would be the second Peruvian president behind bars, after Alberto K. Fujimori, the country’s former dictator, who was convicted of human rights abuses. “For Peru, like any other country, even the possibility of having two presidents as prisoners is an embarrassment,” Marisol Pérez Tello, the country’s justice minister, said in an interview. But she added, “I think this is an important moment to think about our ability to institutionalize the fight against corruption. ” Farther north, in Colombia, leaders were on the defensive as prosecutors said they had evidence that Odebrecht had donated $1 million to President Juan Manuel Santos’s   campaign in 2014. Speaking to reporters last week, the country’s attorney general said a former lawmaker, Otto Bula, had funneled Odebrecht money through an intermediary to the campaign. Mr. Bula is currently under arrest on charges of having paid about $4. 6 million in bribes for various projects in Colombia, including a road linking the country’s interior to the Magdalena River and Caribbean highway known as the Ruta del Sol. Mr. Santos had said he did not do anything wrong and is interested in a full investigation of the case. Roberto Prieto, Mr. Santos’s campaign manager, said in a statement last week he had not met Mr. Bula, “not even for a coffee. ” Investigators are also looking into dealings involving other politicians’ campaigns, including Oscar Iván Zuluaga, a   candidate for president in the 2014 election. Ivan Garzón, a political scientist at Colombia’s University of La Sabana, said Odebrecht had shown how easy it was to hijack the country’s elections for its own gain. “It shows that the problems of exorbitant campaign costs, ones so high the candidates are ready to make a pact with the devil,” he said. In Venezuela, the authorities seem to be taking a different tack toward the revelations: cracking down on outsiders trying to investigate them. Hugo Chávez, the former president of Venezuela, was one of Odebrecht’s principal patrons, steering $11 billion toward Odebrecht for infrastructure projects, including public housing, that undergirded his   revolution. But many of the projects, from bridges to agricultural buildings, were never finished. On Saturday, two researchers from Transparency International and two Brazilian journalists were arrested by Venezuelan intelligence agents while looking into an unfinished bridge Odebrecht was meant to construct over Lake Maracaibo, one of the company’s biggest projects. Jesús Urbina, one of the researchers, said they were questioned but not harmed. The Brazilian journalists were later deported. Juan Guaidó, an opposition lawmaker involved in investigating bribes, said the country’s secret police, controlled by President Nicolás Maduro, fears any attempts to document the unfinished projects. “I think the images of the projects as they look now with nothing done would leave them looking naked,” he said of the government.	1
823	 Theres a story being spread about a homeless man finding a 7 limbed baby alive in a dumpster behind an abortion clinic. It was apparently taken to Inglewood Medical Center. A homeless man made a gruesome discovery on Wednesday when he found a new born baby while rummaging through a dumpster behind a New Jersey abortion clinic. The baby, who had 7 legs and exposed internal organs, was found covered by boxes and trash. Thomas Wynn, a 47-year-old homeless man in the area, said he heard the muffled cries of the infant as he was approaching the trash bin.The abortion clinic, whose name has not yet been released due to fear of angry protests from pro-lifers, has been temporarily closed during the investigation. Doctors can only assume that when the mother found out the baby had multiple limbs and exposed internal organs, she decided to opt for the abortion. At this time, they are trying to find the mother of the child to receive more information about what actually happened.

568	 Ralph George Macchio, Jr. is an actor best known for his role as Daniel LaRusso in the Karate Kid series of films. The first movie in the series came out in 1984, with Ralph in the lead role, and Noriyuki Morita as the supporting actor. As soon as it hit the theaters, the movie became an instant international hit, and the character Daniel LaRusso became a hero for children all around the world. The movie led to three additional sequels, as well as remake, which was released in 2010. Jackie Chan and Jaden Smith star in the remake.	0
986	 Akimbo Obwe’bwe, a 29-year-old zoo intern originally from Gabon, was found guilty of feeding sedatives to Big George, one of the zoo’s top attractions, and partaking in sexual activity with the sedated animal.According to unreleased video footage, Obwe’bwe proceeded to insert the animal’s penis inside his mouth for several minutes but apparently underestimated the strength of the medication, leading the animal to wake up and lash back at the zookeeper, alerting other employees.“Although Mr. Obwe’bwe claims the sexual relationship was consensual, video footage clearly shows he attempted to sedate the animal,” Adam Simmons, a San Diego Zoo spokesman told reporters.

813	 Apparently the Pope commented that the Nae Nae is an actual dance used to summon the Spawn of Satan. “The [Nae Nae] dance heavily resembles a 500 year old demonic ritual that was practiced to spawn Satan himself,” says the Bishop of Rome and the Sovereign of the Vatican City.Fox News (United States) caught up with the Pope in the Vatican today as he delivered his statement towards the LGBT community, divorce and legalization of marijuana as a recreational drug. Pope Francis was also asked to comment on the latest dance craze, the “Nae Nae” dance, to which he shook his head.“This ‘Nae Nae’ dance you speak of, it’s a form of Devil worship,” the Pope told interviewer John Sly. Sly was shocked after the lighthearted question backfired. “It is what the Greek cultists used to do in their attempt to summon Satan and intercept the resurrection of the Holy Father’s Son.” He asked the devotees to not participate in the dance craze and save their peers from doom by stopping the viral hit from being shared.

272	As Black History Month commemorations start to wind down, one festival is just gearing up. Afropunk the Takeover  —   Harlem, running from Tuesday through Feb. 25, will celebrate black culture with music, art, film screenings, discussions and comedy.   by Harlem Stage and the Apollo Theater, this series is the latest offering from Afropunk, which hosts a music festival in Brooklyn. While music is an integral part of this Harlem festival, a couple of its more   events focus on activism  —   from art in response to current events to the expression of black joy  —   which is especially resonant in this moment of racial division and continued protests against the Trump administration. “Bearing Witness as Protest,” at the Studio Museum in Harlem on Thursday, will examine political dissent in art. The evening begins with a guided tour of two exhibitions: “The Window and the Breaking of the Window,” with art from the Black Lives Matter era, and “Circa 1970,” whose focus is on the sociopolitical and cultural issues of the ’70s. The shows further affirm that, in the age of the   news cycle and endless social media feeds, there’s no escape from news of horrific acts of hate, social injustices and inequalities. Works by Rudy Shepherd depict the nine parishioners killed in a Charleston, S. C. church in 2015, and others evoke the “hands up, don’t shoot” rallying cry for protesters in the aftermath of a fatal police shooting in Ferguson, Mo. “It’s a difficult show, and I think some people might be moved by some of the images,” Amanda Hunt, associate curator at the museum, said last week. “They might be saddened and I wanted to give space for all of that. ” Deborah Grant’s “56 Blows,” from her “Blackboard” series, initially looks simplistic  —   the outline of a camcorder drawn in white chalk on a black background underneath is the title rendered in block letters. The title is a haunting nod to the 56 blows inflicted on Rodney King by the Los Angeles police in 1991 the camcorder a reminder of the documentation of the violence. In “A Beautiful Ghetto,” Devin Allen’s    photographs chronicle the response of black residents in Baltimore to such violence  —   like Freddie Gray’s death in police custody. Tying it all together are Kerry James Marshall’s prints echoing slogans that blacks have used to organize, resist and uplift (“by any means necessary,” “black is beautiful”)  —   reminders that the black experience is as much about having pride as exposing social inequities. The tour, starting at 6 p. m. will be followed by a discussion focusing on what it means to bear witness  —   to share traumatic experiences  —   and how the act itself might be a form of protest. The artist Oasa DuVerney and Jess Krug of Harlem CopWatch, a coalition documenting the police’s interactions with the public, will participate. While the Studio Museum will tackle activism through a creative lens, a discussion on Tuesday at the National Black Theater will ask panelists to look inward to ponder the emotional expressions of resistance. The aim of “Black Joy as an Expression of Resistance and Liberation” is to shine a light on the importance of cultivating and seeking out diverse narratives of black lives and opposing stereotypical depictions that pop up across the media. The panelists  —   including the actress Zoë Kravitz, Larry   of ARTNOIR and the Afropunk founder, Matthew Morgan  —   will also discuss the importance of caring for oneself as well as those in your circle of friends and family. “Black joy is really that pursuit of healing all of those wounds,” Sade Lythcott, chief executive of the National Black Theater and a panelist, said in a telephone interview. “When the pendulum swings so far to one side where there is this epidemic of trauma being displayed as entertainment,” she said of videos depicting interactions between the police and black people, “artists are always going to rise up” as a means of both documentation and catharsis. André D. Singleton, a   of the Very Black Project, which celebrates black culture through apparel among other things, and moderator of the “Black Joy” event, said in a phone interview that delving into “the places we don’t want to go, the stewing, actually allowing ourselves to feel,” is imperative to moving forward. “I grew up in the church, and I was taught that happiness is fleeting and joy is something the world can’t take away,” he said, reflecting on the Maze and Frankie Beverly song “Joy and Pain,” which perhaps describes the balance between the two. Here are a few events to check out:  FEB. 24 AT 6:30 P. M. A screening of “The Talk  —   Race in America” at the Cinema at the Maysles Documentary Center. FEB. 24 AT 7:30 P. M. “The Hair Tales,” a discussion about black hair culture, at Harlem Stage. FEB. 25 AT 7:30 P. M. Afropunk: “Unapologetically Black,” a homage to black protest music featuring Robert Glasper and others, at the Apollo Theater.	1
184	The number of extremist groups active in the United States rose for the second year in a row last year, propelled in part by the mainstreaming of   rhetoric by the Trump campaign, particularly on topics like immigration and Islam, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks extremism in the United States. The number of   groups grew the most, almost tripling to 101 in 2016 from 34 in 2015, in part because of President Trump’s 2015 proposal to bar Muslims from entering the United States in response to the Syrian refugee crisis and terrorist attacks in San Bernardino, Calif. and Orlando, Fla. There were a total of 917 hate groups operating in the United States in 2016, an increase from 892 in 2015 and 784 in 2014, the center said in its annual report. The number of organized   groups, like armed militias, dropped by almost 40 percent, however, to 623 in 2016 from 998 in 2015. That decline was a consequence of the increasingly mainstream presence of policy ideas and conspiracy theories about Islam and immigrants that originated on the political fringe, researchers said. Mark Potok, a senior fellow at the center, said Mr. Trump’s election had been “absolutely electrifying to the radical right. ” “Trump has   many of the issues of the radical right, and that has prevented or at least slowed the growth of these groups,” Mr. Potok said. He added, “The Trump phenomenon has really unleashed   hate in this country in a way that is difficult to remember. ” Mr. Trump began his presidential campaign with a series of divisive claims, including a June 2015 speech that referred to Mexican immigrants as “rapists” and “criminals. ” That December, he proposed fighting terrorism with a Muslim ban, a sharp departure from past presidents, including George W. Bush and Barack Obama, who said jihadist groups did not represent all Muslims. Both as a candidate and as president, Mr. Trump has used Twitter and speeches to attack an   list of targets that number in the hundreds. He has sometimes posted images and messages of support on Twitter that appeared to be   or the work of white nationalists, as have his advisers. Nevertheless, Mr. Trump has consistently rejected the notion that his rhetoric or policy proposals have been divisive or extreme. He has often pointed out that his daughter Ivanka and    Jared Kushner, are Orthodox Jews, and when asked about his support among white nationalist groups in an interview with The New York Times last November, he said, “I disavow and condemn” them. The Southern Poverty Law Center said its report tracked only groups that engage in activities in the real world, like passing out leaflets, holding rallies or distributing membership cards. But it warned that such an approach could play down the true reach of extremism because many extremists operate primarily on social media and other online forums. “We make a mighty effort to separate out what is really just some guy with a web page or a web forum or tweeting,” Mr. Potok said in an interview. “They have to do something that happens in the real world as opposed to online. ” He said the drop in   groups might also reflect that they have less to offer members in an age when similar rhetoric can be heard at a political rally. “They can find just as much   vitriol expressed at a Trump rally and be part of a bigger, more exciting movement,” he said. The rise in the number of   groups mirrored the 67 percent surge in   hate crimes reported by the F. B. I. in 2015, the last year for which the agency has statistics. There were 257   episodes reported to the police that year, the highest number since 2001, when more than 480 hate crimes were reported in the wake of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. In the first 10 days after Mr. Trump’s election, the center said, it documented 867 bias incidents, including more than 300 that targeted immigrants or Muslims. Hate crimes across the board appear to have become more common in recent years: In 2015, the F. B. I. said, there were 5, 818 reported bias incidents against racial and religious minorities, gays and transgender people, and others, an increase of 6 percent from the year before.	1
245	MONTGOMERY, Ala.  —   When Luther Strange ran for attorney general in this   state in 2010, he appeared in an advertisement that spoke darkly of the Alabama capital’s “corruption, grand jury investigations, insider deals, abusing the public trust. ” Mr. Strange won that year’s general election easily, and then another one in 2014. But since ascending to the United States Senate this month, he has found his popularity threatened and his fellow Republicans troubled, largely because he accepted the appointment of Gov. Robert J. Bentley, a subject of an active investigation that the new senator spent months overseeing. A startling number of people in and around the State House openly suspect, but lack evidence to prove, that part of Mr. Bentley’s reason for appointing Mr. Strange to the Senate was to try to undermine the inquiry. Beyond clouding Mr. Strange’s early days in the Senate, the appointment to fill the seat of Jeff Sessions, President Trump’s new attorney general, has exacerbated the controversy that has publicly swirled around Mr. Bentley for almost a year. The maze of scandal  —   featuring sexually explicit conversations and the sudden firing of a top law enforcement official, and consuming hundreds of thousands of dollars from public and political bank accounts  —   has led to swelling demands for the impeachment of the governor, a Republican. “It’s like every time we turn around, there’s somebody else who is potentially going to jail, or being too greedy, or being too arrogant,” said State Representative Ed Henry, a Republican who has pushed for Mr. Bentley’s ouster. Mr. Bentley, 74, who did not agree to an interview request, has been on the defensive for nearly a year. In March, Spencer Collier, whom Mr. Bentley had fired as the head of the Alabama Law Enforcement Agency, accused the governor of having an affair with an aide and said the aide had served as the “de facto governor. ” An audio recording of Mr. Bentley, said to be in conversation with the woman, Rebekah Caldwell Mason, was leaked and left Alabama residents listening to the governor utter phrases like “when I stand behind you and I put my arms around you and I put my hands on your breasts. ” Mr. Bentley, whose wife of 50 years filed for divorce in August 2015, said he had apologized for “any conversations and behavior that was inappropriate,” but he insisted that he had not had a physical relationship with Mrs. Mason. Mrs. Mason, who declined to comment and whose husband leads the Governor’s Office of   and Volunteer Service, resigned as Mr. Bentley’s senior political adviser soon after the governor’s public acknowledgment of misconduct. Mr. Bentley’s words and Mrs. Mason’s formal exit  —   she and her husband have remained connected to the governor and traveled to last month’s presidential inauguration with him  —   did little to curb outrage. Lawsuits emerged, federal and state investigations began, and at least one grand jury here has been considering evidence. Mr. Strange, a former lobbyist widely regarded as ambitious and long seen as the future of Republican politics in Alabama, attended some of the grand jury testimony. Then Mr. Bentley, in his second and final term, chose Mr. Strange as Mr. Sessions’s replacement in the Senate and scheduled a special election for 2018. When his appointment was announced, Mr. Strange, 63, said the rampant speculation about an inquiry involving the governor was “unfair to him and unfair to the process. ” He also said, in a remark that has since been parsed, analyzed and criticized, “We have never said in our office that we are investigating the governor. ” Less than a week later, the man Mr. Bentley chose to succeed Mr. Strange as attorney general, Steven T. Marshall, appointed Alabama’s equivalent of a special prosecutor and asked her to “assume oversight of the state’s interest in the current investigative matter relating to Gov. Robert Bentley, to include all potential criminal matters arising from that investigation. ” One of the lawyers leading the inquiry, Matt Hart, helped to secure the conviction last year of Michael G. Hubbard, then the speaker of the State House of Representatives. Although many senior Republicans in Alabama and in Washington strongly urged Mr. Bentley to appoint Mr. Strange, the only one of six finalists to have been elected statewide, the choice and Mr. Marshall’s acknowledgment of an investigation still upset many people here. “Luther would have been the man to beat in an election,” said State Representative Corey Harbison, a Republican who decided to support Mr. Bentley’s impeachment because of misgivings about why the governor named Mr. Strange to the Senate. “He would have been solid, and he probably would have beaten the governor’s appointment. ” He added, “Luther’s ambition to become a United States senator caused him to do things that I don’t think he would have done in normal circumstances. ” Mr. Harbison said he would have strongly considered supporting Mr. Strange in next year’s special election. Mr. Strange said in a statement that he was confident that prosecutors in his former office would “relentlessly pursue the rule of law,” and his allies noted that his Senate appointment had hardly derailed the inquiry related to Mr. Bentley. “My own commitment to rooting out corruption in government speaks for itself,” Mr. Strange said. “That vow has never wavered and will continue to guide me as I serve the people of Alabama in the U. S. Senate. ” But Republicans are talking regularly of the political obstacles the senator might confront next year, when he could face a primary campaign focused more on ethics than on devotion to conservative policy ideas. Perry Hooper Jr. a former member of the Legislature who was a finalist for the Senate seat, said he was considering a challenge to Mr. Strange that could center on the circumstances of the appointment. And Mr. Strange’s new political patron, Mr. Bentley, is unlikely to be of much help. According to an internal poll commissioned by Republican officeholders and described by several Republicans who were not authorized to discuss a confidential survey, the governor’s approval rating is at an abysmally low level. “It’s very important in our state for our governor to be recognized and acknowledged as the strongest elected official in the state of Alabama,” said John H. Merrill, a Republican and the secretary of state. “I don’t think that there are a whole lot of people in our state who would think the governor is in that position today. ” With Mr. Strange’s turn at the ballot box more than a year away, Mr. Bentley is in more immediate political jeopardy. This is chiefly because his choice of Mr. Strange for the Senate seat has helped spur new support for an impeachment push that Mr. Henry conceded had been “fizzling out. ” (Last year, Mr. Strange asked the Legislature to suspend its impeachment inquiry because his office was conducting “related work. ” For now, the Legislature’s review, part of a murky process, remains on hold and a large number of lawmakers have said its findings would prove decisive in any votes they cast on impeachment.) “I met with him the day he appointed Luther Strange and told him, ‘If you do this, it will be the end,’” Mr. Henry recalled of a recent conversation with the governor. “He believed that was his best appointment, and it did nothing but   his impeachment, and I believe it has probably   a potential indictment. It reeked of corruption. ” One of Mr. Bentley’s lawyers, William C. Athanas, said that Mr. Bentley would “cooperate fully” in the state’s inquiry but that it would be “inappropriate for the governor to comment on the substance of this matter. ” Even if the criminal investigations remain open, some House Republicans believe that by the end of May, they will have settled the matter of whether Mr. Bentley will keep his job. Despite winning two statewide general elections with ease, Mr. Bentley is frequently isolated. Still, after Mr. Bentley had decided to promote a man who was investigating him to the Senate, he called Mr. Hooper to talk. He spoke of old alliances and cherished relationships. “You can’t buy loyalty,” Mr. Bentley told Mr. Hooper, “and you can’t buy friendship. ”	1
761	 Some women at work were discussing the following:Apparently they saw on Facebook that, as an executive order by President Obama, the government is giving everyone who filed 2014 taxes a $2,350.00 rebate/refund to be mailed out this month (November 12, 2015). I have looked everywhere (on the Internet) that I can think of. The only place I can find it is on a site called “United Media Publishing”. Also, the only reference to this that I can find on Facebook sends a person to this same article from United Media Publishing. Is this true??? The Obama administration has directed IRS director John Koskinen to have the agency prepare for one of the largest cash refund/rebate hand-outs in the history of the organization. The President has authorized by way of an executive order that a 2350 dollar tax rebate be issued to every American who filed a tax return in the 2014 fiscal year, irrespective of whether they paid tax or not.Update: A representative for the IRS confirms that the first tax rebate checks will go into the mail November 12th.	0

393	• “Moonlight” is best picture. In a bewildering end to the show, “La La Land” was first announced as the winner before its jubilant cast and crew were interrupted with a scarcely believable correction. • Emma Stone won best actress for “La La Land. ” Casey Affleck won best actor for “Manchester by the Sea. ” • “La La Land” won six Oscars, including best director, best original score and best song (denying   Miranda an EGOT in the process). The film had 14 nominations, tied for the most ever. • Jimmy Kimmel hosted the show. • Here’s a red carpet slide show and a fashion review. LOS ANGELES  —   In an epic flub that drew gasps of horror  —   and joy  —   at the Dolby Theater here, Faye Dunaway mistakenly named “La La Land” best picture at the 89th Academy Awards on Sunday night, but in reality “Moonlight” won the top prize. The producers of “La La Land” were still thanking their families and fellow artists when the interjection came that “Moonlight” had in fact won, as everyone wondered if that was a joke. But it wasn’t, and the “La La Land” people quickly exited the stage as producers and stars of “Moonlight,” just as stunned as everyone else, walked on. Warren Beatty and Ms. Dunaway had presented the best picture award. When Mr. Beatty opened the envelope, he took an extended pause before showing the card to Ms. Dunaway, who then announced “La La Land” as the winner. “I want to tell you what happened,” Mr. Beatty said in the chaotic moments after “Moonlight” was announced as the winner. “I opened the envelope, and it said ‘Emma Stone, La La Land.’ That’s why I took such a long look at Faye and at you. I wasn’t trying to be funny. This is ‘Moonlight,’ the best picture. ” “Moonlight,” the story of a young, gay, black man, won three statuettes in total, including best adapted screenplay and best supporting actor. “Very clearly, even in my dreams this could not be true,” said Barry Jenkins, the director of “Moonlight. ” “But to hell with dreams, I’m done with it, because this is true. Oh my goodness. ” Held up as an escapist,    antidote for the times, the   “La La Land” won six Oscars, including statuettes for Damien Chazelle’s directing and Ms. Stone’s acting, during a jaunty ceremony that swung between   and political acrimony  —   before its wild ending. “It threw me more than a bit,” Mahershala Ali, who won best supporting actor for “Moonlight,” said backstage. “I just didn’t want to go up there and take anything from somebody, you know?” PricewaterhouseCoopers, the accounting firm that handles the Oscars balloting, took responsibility for the mixup. “We sincerely apologize to ‘Moonlight,’ ‘La La Land,’ Warren Beatty, Faye Dunaway and Oscar viewers for the error,” the firm said in a statement. “The presenters had mistakenly been given the wrong category envelope and when discovered, was immediately corrected. We are currently investigating how this could have happened. ” ABC News tweeted out a photo that showed that the envelope in Mr. Beatty’s hand read “Actress in a Leading Role. ” After the show, Ms. Stone said on ABC that she had held onto the envelope with the card bearing her name after she won best actress. In a blog post published on Medium this month, Brian Cullinan and Martha Ruiz of the firm PricewaterhouseCoopers, explained the process of handling the envelopes for the Oscars. Mr. Cullinan wrote that he and Ms. Ruiz each had a full set of envelopes and stood on opposite sides of the stage, where they handed envelopes to presenters. “It doesn’t sound very complicated,” Mr. Cullinan said, “but you have to make sure you’re giving the presenter the right envelope. ” Here are other notable moments from the show: “Hacksaw Ridge,” the true story of a heroic World War II medic, won Oscars for sound mixing and film editing, a category that is often predictive of the best picture winner. Kenneth Lonergan won the best screenplay statuette for his “Manchester by the Sea,” the story of a grieving New England handyman. Casey Affleck, who played the lead role in Mr. Lonergan’s film, beat Denzel Washington (“Fences”) for best actor. “I’m just dumbfound I’m included,” Mr. Affleck said. The supporting acting prizes went to Viola Davis for her work in “Fences,” about a Pittsburgh family in the 1950s, and Mr. Ali for his portrayal of a sympathetic drug dealer in “Moonlight,” which also collected the adapted screenplay Oscar, for Mr. Jenkins and Tarell Alvin McCraney. “All you people out there who feel like there’s no mirror for you, that your life is not reflected, the academy has your back, the A. C. L. U. has your back, we have your back  —   and for the next four years, we will not leave you alone, we will not forget you,” Mr. Jenkins said from the stage. Among the nominees leaving with nothing: “Lion,” an adoption   with six nominations, and the box office hit “Hidden Figures,” which had three nods. As expected, Ms. Davis won the best supporting actress Oscar  —   her first  —   for playing a   housewife in “Fences. ” (She won best actress at the 2010 Tony Awards for playing the same role onstage. She was the one who decided to drop to the supporting category for the Oscars.) An intense, nearly overcome Ms. Davis touched on her family, her industry “cheerleaders,” the film’s director (Mr. Washington) graveyards, dashed dreams and the playwright August Wilson, who adapted his “Fences” for the screen and whom Ms. Viola praised as someone who “exhumed and exalted the ordinary people. ” The night’s first award went to Mr. Ali, who tearfully thanked the cast and crew of “Moonlight” and his own family. “Peace and blessings,” he said, avoiding a repeat of the pointed comments he made at previous awards shows about the Trump administration’s travel ban. After two years when the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences was criticized as racist for overlooking black actors and films about   experiences, this year’s nominee list was remarkably diverse. Six black actors received nominations, a record. The foreign film and documentary races were notably relevant this year. Among foreign films, the German satire “Toni Erdmann” initially had the momentum. But Mr. Trump’s travel ban put the spotlight on Iran’s entry, “The Salesman,” whose director, Asghar Farhadi, said that he would boycott the ceremony in protest  —   a decision that may have ultimately helped his film win. Anousheh Ansari, an   businesswoman, accepted the award for “The Salesman” and read a message from Mr. Farhadi. The note said that he was not attending in solidarity with immigrants “who have been disrespected by the inhumane law,” referring to the Trump administration’s travel ban. Among nonfiction films, Ava DuVernay’s   look at mass incarceration, “13th,” was campaigned for aggressively by Netflix, and the civil   “I Am Not Your Negro” surged late in the season. But the nearly             “O. J.: Made in America” was named best documentary. In accepting the award, Ezra Edelman, the film’s director, dedicated the Oscar to Nicole Brown Simpson, Ronald Goldman and “the victims of police violence, police brutality, racially motivated violence and criminal injustice. ” Mr. Kimmel, an Everyman schtick carefully in place, opened his monologue by asking viewers, both conservative and liberal, to come together in a calm conversation. “If we could all do that we could make America great again, we really could,” he said, to applause. Mr. Kimmel, appearing confident and calm  —   and with the   audience, munching on Red Vines and Junior Mints, now firmly on his side  —   soon took sharper aim. In a reference to President Trump, Mr. Kimmel said, “Remember last year, when it seemed like the Oscars were racist?” As the ceremony went on, organizers played up Hollywood glamour and paid homage to Academy Awards history. Music interludes were taken from the scores of “Top Gun” and “Tootsie. ” Shirley MacLaine appeared as a presenter, joking that the standing ovation was “the nicest reception I’ve had in 250, 000 years. ” At one point, Mr. Kimmel trotted out a tour bus full of unsuspecting tourists, to mixed results. But politics was a consistent topic. Gael García Bernal, presenting best animated film to “Zootopia,” said, “As a Mexican, as a Latin American, as a migrant worker, as a human being, I am against any form of wall that wants to separate us. ” Left to bridge the gap between people watching from their sofas in Kansas City and the theater filled with coastal elites was Mr. Kimmel. In a moment that certainly checked the populist box, the busload of unsuspecting Hollywood tourists, selfie sticks aloft, found themselves ushered into the Dolby Theater, and shuffled before Hollywood   and the world. The bit, which went on at some length, drew a polarizing response on social media, with some viewers criticizing Mr. Kimmel for exploiting the tourists and mocking an Asian woman’s name. Later, Mr. Kimmel joked that President Trump had not tweeted about the show. So Mr. Kimmel typed out a tweet to the president on his phone: “Hey @realDonaldTrump u up?”	1
304	There has been no shortage of reports that President Trump is still very popular in the bars and diners of the old industrial towns that decided the 2016 presidential election. But if you want to meet the voters who will decide the biggest political story of the 2018 congressional elections, you might have to fly right over the   workers of Youngstown, Ohio, and go talk to the real housewives of Orange County, Calif. Yes, it’s early. But if we’re already breathlessly checking in on Altoona, Pa. then add the O. C. to the mix. Orange County was the heart of Sun Belt conservatism and one of the most reliably Republican bastions of the 20th century. It voted Republican in every presidential election from 1936 until 2016, when it voted for Hillary Clinton by a   margin. It’s hard to think of a place that was less relevant to Mr. Trump’s fortunes in 2016. Mrs. Clinton’s success in Orange County, and in   and Hispanic areas elsewhere in the Sun Belt, helped her win the popular vote  —   though there was no payoff in the Electoral College. But it’s districts like these that will decide whether the Democrats can make a serious run at control of the House. There is no guarantee that the Democrats can put the House in play, even if Mr. Trump’s approval ratings remain as low as they are now or slip further. The Republicans have so many safe seats that they could even survive a   wave election like the ones that swept Democrats to power in 2006 and out of power in 2010. The Democrats need 24 seats to retake the House. But whether the Democrats can do it will come down to places like Orange County, which is more populous than Iowa. Four congressional districts that have at least some territory in the county still have Republican representatives, and all four were carried by Mrs. Clinton. It’s not much of an exaggeration to say that the road to a Democratic House begins and ends at Laguna Beach. Darrell Issa, who represents the California coast from southern Orange County to part of La Jolla, is probably the nation’s most vulnerable incumbent. That’s based on factors that tend to predict which districts are likeliest to be competitive  —   like the result of his last election (he won by just 1 point) and how the district voted in recent presidential contests. By the same measures, the   vulnerable Republican is Dana Rohrabacher, whose district is immediately north of Mr. Issa’s  —   stretching up the Orange County coast from Laguna Beach to Sunset Beach. In between, Ed Royce and Mimi Walters represent the   and   vulnerable districts. Of course, the exact House battleground will be shaped by a lot more than these few factors. Democratic recruitment and Republican retirements will play a big role, and a competitive race will expose the vulnerability or resilience of individual Republicans to a degree that recent elections have not. But Orange County is not an outlier. Across the nation, the most vulnerable Republican incumbents among the 50 or so most competitive seats tend to be in relatively   metropolitan districts with   Hispanic populations. It’s the opposite of most of the 2016 presidential battleground states, which were whiter, less educated and far less Hispanic than the country as a whole. Mr. Trump might still be riding high in central Pennsylvania steel towns, but there are plenty of signs that his support remains weak in precisely the districts where House Republicans are most vulnerable. The most recent Pew Research poll found that Mr. Trump had just a 38 percent approval rating among white voters with a college degree, with 61 percent disapproving. Mrs. Clinton probably won   white voters by only a narrow margin, so the Pew result seems to imply a weakening in his standing. Mr. Trump’s best poll of the month, from Fox News, had his rating among   white voters at just 45 percent. Most Hispanic voters, unsurprisingly, remain deeply dissatisfied with the president as well. Of course, Hispanic turnout is notoriously weak in midterm elections. There are several districts that look competitive on paper but might prove elusive to the Democrats if the electorate remains as old and white as it was in 2014 or 2010. The   often traditionally   voters who supported Mrs. Clinton in 2016 will be a puzzle for both parties. Mr. Trump will plainly be a burden for some Republican politicians, who will agonize over how much to distance themselves from the president. Democrats have a different challenge. The party’s increasingly dominant progressive wing could be a liability in these moderate districts. Only two of the 24 most competitive districts went for Bernie Sanders in a primary contest. Many broke for Mrs. Clinton by landslide margins. That’s a fact that’s unlikely to quell the internal Democratic debate over the party’s future. But it does offer   clarity on one debate: whether the party should seek to resurrect its strength in the Rust Belt or build on its strength in diverse and affluent suburbs. To some extent, this is a false choice. But there really is no choice at all when it comes to the battle for the House in 2018. The competitive districts are mainly suburban, and there are startlingly few competitive   districts in the old Rust Belt that are traditionally Democratic but that are held by Republicans. That’s due to aggressive Republican gerrymandering in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan and Wisconsin. Even in those states, the potential battlegrounds are suburban  —   including the four   districts around Philadelphia. All four count among the 31 most plausibly competitive districts. None of this is to say that the white   voters who defined the 2016 cycle will be unimportant in 2018. The races for Senate seats and governor’s mansions will often play out in the same white   battleground states that decided the 2016 election. There are a few competitive   districts in Iowa, New York and Maine with large numbers of white   voters. In a wave election, many more white   districts could come into play elsewhere. But elections are, well, decided by everyone. Dismissing   diverse and metropolitan America as the “bubble” in 2018 could prove to be as big a mistake as dismissing rural, white   America in 2016.	1

12	MERCED, Calif.  —   Jeff Marchini and others in the Central Valley here bet their farms on the election of Donald J. Trump. His message of reducing regulations and taxes appealed to this Republican stronghold, one of Mr. Trump’s strongest bases of support in the state. As for his promises about cracking down on illegal immigrants, many assumed Mr. Trump’s pledges were mostly just talk. But two weeks into his administration, Mr. Trump has signed executive orders that have upended the country’s immigration laws. Now farmers here are deeply alarmed about what the new policies could mean for their workers, most of whom are unauthorized, and the businesses that depend on them. “Everything’s coming so quickly,” Mr. Marchini said. “We’re not loading people into buses or deporting them, that’s not happening yet. ” As he looked out over a crew of workers bent over as they rifled through muddy leaves to find purple heads of radicchio, he said that as a businessman, Mr. Trump would know that farmers had invested millions of dollars into produce that is growing right now, and that not being able to pick and sell those crops would represent huge losses for the state economy. “I’m confident that he can grasp the magnitude and the anxiety of what’s happening now. ” Mr. Trump’s immigration policies could transform California’s Central Valley, a stretch of lowlands that extends from Redding to Bakersfield. Approximately 70 percent of all farmworkers here are living in the United States illegally, according to researchers at University of California, Davis. The impact could reverberate throughout the valley’s precarious economy, where agriculture is by far the largest industry. With 6. 5 million people living in the valley, the fields in this state bring in $35 billion a year and provide more of the nation’s food than any other state. The consequences of a smaller immigrant work force would ripple not just through the orchards and dairies, but also to locally owned businesses, restaurants, schools and even seemingly unrelated industries, like the insurance market. Many here feel vindicated by the election, and signs declaring “Vote to make America great again” still dot the highways. But in conversations with nearly a dozen farmers, most of whom voted for Mr. Trump, each acknowledged that they relied on workers who provided false documents. And if the administration were to weed out illegal workers, farmers say their businesses would be crippled. Even Republican lawmakers from the region have supported plans that would give farmworkers a path to citizenship. “If you only have legal labor, certain parts of this industry and this region will not exist,” said Harold McClarty, a   farmer in Kingsburg whose operation grows, packs and ships peaches, plums and grapes throughout the country. “If we sent all these people back, it would be a total disaster. ” Mr. McClarty is not just concerned about his business, but also about his work force, he said. Many of them have worked for him   for more than a decade, making at least $11 an hour. After immigration officials audited his employee records a few years ago, he was forced to let go of dozens of employees. “These people had been working for us for a long time, and we depended on them. ” Now he worries that a Trump administration could mandate a Homeland Security Department program called   which was aimed at stopping the use of fraudulent documents. In all but a few states, the program is voluntary and only a small fraction of businesses use it. Farmers here have faced a persistent labor shortage for years, in part because of increased policing at the border and the rising prices charged by smugglers who help people sneak across. The   stream of people coming from rural towns in southern Mexico has nearly stopped entirely. The existing field workers are aging, and many of their children find   jobs outside agriculture. Many growers here and across the country are hopeful that the new administration will expand and simplify   visas, which allow them to bring in temporary workers from other countries for agricultural jobs. California farmers have increasingly come to rely on the program in the last few years. But Mr. McClarty and others say that legalizing the existing work force should be the first priority. While they support the idea of deporting immigrants who have been convicted of serious crimes, they oppose forcing people to leave the country for minor crimes, like driving without a license. Since the election, they have continued to call their congressional representatives and lobbied through trade associations, like the Western Growers Association, whose chief executive is part of Mr. Trump’s agricultural advisory board. Farmers are also anxiously awaiting the administration’s plans to alter longstanding trade agreements. Mr. Trump has said he will pull out of the North American Free Trade Agreement if he cannot negotiate better terms for the United States. Growers would benefit if Mr. Trump negotiated more favorable terms. But backing out of the agreement entirely could provoke retaliation from Mexico that would hurt California’s agricultural industry, which earned $21 billion from trade last year. Yet, many of Mr. Trump’s supporters say they are counting on him to follow through on his promises. Dan Stein, president of the Federation for American Immigration Reform, said that limiting the use of foreign labor would push more Americans into jobs that had primarily been performed by immigrants. “It doesn’t matter if it’s programming computers or picking in fields,” he said, “Any time you’re admitting substitutes for American labor you depress wages and working conditions and deter Americans. ” The prospect has business owners in the valley on edge. Patricia Pantoj runs a travel agency in Madera, north of Fresno, where the city’s approximately 60, 000 residents are predominantly Latino and work in the fields. This year, she said, fewer people than ever before traveled back to their hometowns in Mexico. “They didn’t want to risk it,” she said. “Everyone is scared, even if they have papers. ” A few doors away from the travel agency, Maria Valero said all the customers at her gift shop were undocumented. “If they went away, I would be out of business tomorrow,” she said. Jhovani Segura, an insurance agent in Firebaugh, near the southern end of the valley, said that as much as 80 percent of their new car insurance policies came from undocumented immigrants who, under a new state law, became eligible for driver’s licenses in 2015. “If there were mass deportations, we would have to cancel half of our policies,” he said. In Ceres, north of Merced, the public school district is the largest employer by a large number, and many of the jobs were created to support the children of immigrants. Administrators say any crackdown would result in huge job losses and would reduce funding, which is distributed by the state based on need, for all the children in the district. Most of the workers in Mr. McClarty’s vineyards and orchards have   lives in the area. Javier Soto, 46, bought a home for his family of five in Reedley, a city of 25, 000 that calls itself “the world’s fruit basket. ” He has worked for Mr. McClarty’s farm for the last six years and his supervisor knows he is here without papers. “It is more scary now that he is really the president and we see what he is doing,” Mr. Soto said. They are hopeful Mr. Trump will not make good on most of his threats. “Quien más habla, menos hace,” they tell each other  —   the more you talk, the less you do. There are too many of them, they reason, to throw them all out. “We’re just waiting and praying, hoping that somebody can convince them that we are not hurting anyone by being here,” said Isabel Rios, 49, who has been picking grapes for the last two decades. Like most women in the fields, she covers her face with a bandanna to protect against the blaring sun, dust and pesticides. Her two children, 9 and 18, are   citizens and she worries what will happen to them if she is sent back to Mexico. “Who will benefit if we are not here?” Mr. Marchini, the radicchio farmer, said he felt similarly after seeing generations of workers on his family farm send their children to college and join the middle class. Mr. Marchini’s family has farmed in the valley for four generations and he grew up working side by side with Mexican immigrants. He said that no feasible increase in wages or change in conditions would be enough to draw   Americans back into the fields. It was the other conservatives, Mr. Marchini said, who were out of touch about how to deal with foreign workers. “If you find a way to get in here,” he said, “there’s a need for what you do. ”	1
750	 I was trying to find out if anyone had died from the new challenge where teens drop a condom full of water on another persons head. It looks dangerous to me but I don’t think this story is real. A 17-year-old teen was reportedly killed performing yet another stupid internet stunt, this one involving condoms filled with water. The “condom challenge,” designed, apparently, to prove that no guy is actually “too big” to wear a condom, involved filling a condom with an excessive amount of water, and then dropping it onto a participant’s head. “Jessica Moore and her friend, Theresa Jones, were reportedly filming themselves performing the ‘condom challenge,’ and Jessica was killed in the processes, drowning when the condom filled with liquid got stuck around her head,” said police chief Larry Whittum. “This is a stupid and dangerous challenge that has no real merit. Everyone knows that condoms can fit any size penis, and filling a rubber with water and dropping it on someone’s head is not going to bring awareness to anything.” Empire News is intended for entertainment purposes only.

9	More than a quarter of a million Somali refugees got a huge break on Thursday. A Kenyan judge ruled that the Kenyan government’s contentious plan to close Dadaab, the world’s largest refugee camp, was “illegal” and “discriminatory,” and that the refugees could not be forcefully relocated. For years, Kenya has threatened to shut the sprawling camp, a crowded, sweltering realm near Kenya’s border with Somalia that has been a refuge for desperate people since Somalis began fleeing to Kenya in 1991, when their country was plunged into civil war. The government has said the camp is a breeding ground for Islamist terrorists, though the evidence is mixed for how central it really is to Kenya’s terrorism problem, which has claimed hundreds of lives in recent years. The vast majority of refugees who live in Dadaab are Somalis, too scared to return home to a nation plagued by war, famine, chaos, poverty and disease. On Thursday, Judge John Mativo of Kenya’s High Court, the equivalent of an American Federal District Court, ruled that the government’s plan to close the camp “specifically targeting Somali refugees is an act of group persecution, illegal, discriminatory and therefore unconstitutional. ” The judge also ordered the Kenyan government to reinstate its refugee department, which the government essentially closed last year. In May, Kenya announced it was serious about closing Dadaab, though it has since missed several   deadlines. Diplomats, United Nations agencies and human rights groups have told the Kenyans that forcing the refugees to return to Somalia would be a violation of international law. Kenya’s foreign donors, including the United States, have threatened to withhold payments if the government kicks out the refugees. That has left Kenya in a tight spot: Relocating hundreds of thousands of people would not be cheap. Few say they believe Dadaab’s future is settled. Within hours of the ruling, the Kenyan government vowed to appeal, arguing that the situation in Somalia had improved and the refugees could return. It is unclear whether the Kenyan government will follow the court order. Though Kenya’s judiciary is considered strong and independent, the president has enormous power and Kenyan security forces routinely violate the rights of Somali refugees. Still, the pressure is growing to do something about Dadaab. Aid officials, who have sharply criticized repatriation, admit that the current situation is untenable. “Kenya and the international community must work toward finding alternative solutions for refugees, including local integration options,” said Muthoni Wanyeki, an Amnesty International regional director. More than 9, 000 Somali refugees were resettled in the United States last fiscal year, many coming from Dadaab. But a recent change in United States policy could threaten that trend. President Trump signed an executive order last month barring Somalis from traveling to the United States. Over the past two weeks, scores of refugees have been bused back and forth between Dadaab and Nairobi, Kenya’s capital, as the United States’ refugee policy is argued in American courts.	1

422	When the Holocaust Expropriated Art Recovery Act was adopted unanimously by Congress in December, it was widely praised as a necessary tool to help the heirs of Holocaust victims recover art stolen from their families during World War II. Now the efficacy of the HEAR Act, as it is known, may get an early test in New York State Court, where the heirs of Fritz Grunbaum, an Austrian Jewish entertainer, are citing it in efforts to claim two valuable colorful drawings by Egon Schiele. Grunbaum’s extraordinary   art collection has been generating controversy almost since the Nazis confiscated it from his Vienna apartment in 1938 and shipped him to his death in the Dachau concentration camp. For years, his heirs have argued that the collection, which included 81 Schieles, was stolen by the Nazis. Collectors, dealers and some museums, however, have countered that the art was inventoried by the Nazis but not stolen, and that Grunbaum’s    sold 53 of the Schieles in a legitimate transaction, to a Swiss art dealer, in 1956. They say that previous courts have found that the Schieles were not stolen and that no further claims should be considered on those works. But the Grunbaum heirs contend that the previous claims, in this case and others, were settled on legal technicalities, not the merits of the argument that the art was looted by the Nazis, and that this is just the sort of case the law was enacted to address. Arguing for the legislation last year, one sponsor, Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, said that it would ensure that “claims to   art are not unfairly barred by statutes of limitations and other similar   nonmerits defenses. ” The law created a federal statute of limitations for such claims: six years from the time of “actual discovery” of the art’s whereabouts. It is in line with the spirit of two international proclamations stating that technicalities should not be employed to prevent stolen property from being returned to rightful owners. The legislation has also been cited by lawyers for the estate of Alice Leffman, in a federal suit against the Metropolitan Museum of Art, seeking restitution of a valuable Picasso painting, “The Actor. ” In court filings, the museum has asked that the case be dismissed, and has stated that it does not believe that the Picasso was stolen. The two Schieles now being pursued, “Woman in a Black Pinafore” (1911) and “Woman Hiding Her Face” (1912) were part of the 1956 sale to the Swiss dealer. But Raymond Dowd, a lawyer for the Grunbaum heirs  —   Timothy Reif, David Fraenkel and Milos Vavra  —   argues that the circumstances of that transaction have never been fully explored and that his clients did not discover the lost works until they were noticed for sale at an art fair in 2015. Mr. Dowd and one of the heirs, Mr. Vavra, previously pursued the restitution of another Schiele drawing from the Grunbaum collection, “Seated Woman With Bent Left Leg (Torso). ”  In that litigation, filed in 2005, the court ruled in favor of a Boston businessman, David Bakalar, who had bought the work in 1963. It said too much time had passed since the Grunbaum heirs had made their claim, causing evidence to be lost. Mr. Dowd appealed the ruling, but lost. In 2015 Mr. Bakalar, who paid $4, 300 for the work, sold it at auction for $1. 3 million. Mr. Dowd filed his new suit in November of that year, after learning that Richard Nagy, a London art dealer and Schiele specialist, was trying to sell “Woman in a Black Pinafore” and “Woman Hiding Her Face” at an art fair at the Park Avenue Armory. The two drawings are valued together at roughly $5 million, according to Mr. Dowd. Mr. Nagy has fought the claim, arguing in court papers that he acquired both artworks “in good faith and in a commercially reasonable manner” after the United States Supreme Court declined to hear Mr. Dowd’s appeal of the “Bakalar” case. His lawyers argue that previous court rulings about the Schieles from the Grunbaum collection were based on a finding that they had been properly conveyed in 1956. Still, last year Judge Charles Ramos of the New York State Supreme Court ordered that the two drawings be held by Mr. Nagy’s shipping agent, pending the resolution of the legal action. Mr. Nagy and his lawyer, Thaddeus Stauber, have appealed. In an interview, Mr. Stauber said the case against Mr. Nagy should be dismissed. “It is what we call ‘Bakalar 2,’” he said. “It’s the same case being brought by these heirs and their counsel over the exact same art collection, so the case shouldn’t go forward. ” He said Mr. Dowd was wrong to invoke the act because the law says it does not apply to cases where there has already been a final judgment the Bakalar case, he said, had determined that the Grunbaum Schieles weren’t stolen. Mr. Stauber added: “It’s kind of offensive to everybody who’s been involved in this field, claimants and otherwise, to keep touting something which the courts have decided. You had your trial. Evidence was presented. It’s over. ” But Agnes Peresztegi, the president and legal counsel of the Commission on Art Recovery  —   an organization founded by the billionaire art collector Ronald S. Lauder to encourage the restitution of artworks stolen during World War II  —   said in an interview that she agreed with Mr. Dowd. The “Bakalar” case was not decided on the merits, she said, but on the technical issue that too much time had passed to pursue a claim. She said she welcomes the use of the new law in deciding whether many of the Grunbaum collection’s Schieles, including the two owned by Mr. Nagy, were stolen. “My view,” she said, “is that all claimants that have a nonfrivolous case will have a day in court, and cases without facts to support them will be dismissed. ” Mr. Dowd remains optimistic for his clients. “We believe that the expert report and scholarship of Dr. Jonathan Petropoulos, the world’s leading expert in this field, will persuade the court that the evidence shows that Fritz Grunbaum was a victim of Nazi art looting,” he wrote in an email.	1
293	ROME  —   This much is known: In 70 AD the Romans destroyed Jerusalem, looted the temple of its treasure  —   including a   solid gold menorah  —   and brought at least some of the artifacts back to Rome in a triumphant procession. Depictions of the victorious Roman army and its booty are carved on the Arch of Titus, near the Colosseum, built about a decade later to commemorate that military triumph. What later happened to the menorah has been the object of intense speculation for centuries, giving rise to various, sometimes colorful, legends and scholarly hypotheses over its whereabouts. Now, Rome’s Jewish community and the Vatican have teamed up to produce an exhaustive exhibition on the menorah, which in time became an enduring symbol of Jewish culture and religion, in a collaboration that leaders of the two communities described as a further step in solidifying their ties. “This is a historic event,” Ruth Dureghello, the president of Rome’s Jewish community, said at a news conference on Monday. The menorah has connections to Rome, she added, “so such an important exhibit could only start here. ” Jews and Catholics have a long history of mutual suspicion and conflict, but relations between the two religions have been increasingly positive. In 1965, the Vatican issued “Nostra Aetate,” a landmark document that condemned  . Pope John Paul II, the first modern pope to pray in a synagogue, made an effort to improve the relationship, as have his successors, Pope Benedict XVI and Pope Francis. The exhibit, “Menorah: Worship, History, Legend,” which includes about 130 artifacts, will open in May and will be presented at the Vatican Museums and at Rome’s Jewish Museum. The collaboration between the two institutions will finally transform longstanding dialogue into something “concrete,” Ms. Dureghello said. More than three years in the making, the project is a “sign of fruitful collaboration between our two communities,” said Cardinal Giuseppe Bertello, the president of the governorate of the Vatican City State. He added that it “makes visible the dialogue between the two religions and the close ties between the Jewish and Christian faiths. ” These are ties that Francis has championed, said Cardinal Kurt Koch, the president of the Pontifical Commission for Religious Relations With the Jews, who noted that on the day after Francis became pope in March 2013, he wrote to the city’s Jewish community, eager to improve relations between the two religions. Menorahs have been used in churches as liturgical objects, said Arnold Nesselrath, deputy director of the Vatican Museums and one of the curators of the exhibit. While the historical and cultural importance of the menorah from the temple in Jerusalem is central to the exhibition, its physical absence is equally significant. According to some scholars, the menorah remained in Rome until the Vandals looted the city in 455. After that, its whereabouts become even murkier. Some accounts assert that the menorah was destroyed in a fire others say that it was taken to Carthage and then on to Constantinople,   Istanbul. Some claim that it sank to the bottom of the Mediterranean in a shipwreck others state that such a shipwreck took place on the Tiber River. In 1818, a navigation company was founded to drag the Tiber in search of precious objects including the menorah, said Francesco Leone, an art historian at the G. d’Annunzio University of   and another curator of the exhibit. “The venture failed,” he said. Novels have also taken up the theme, positing that the menorah was returned to Israel, or that perhaps it never left at all and was buried secretly on the road to Jerusalem. But the most colorful and perhaps most repeated, if unsubstantiated, account is that the Vatican has hidden the menorah for centuries in an underground deposit, either in Vatican City or under the Basilica of St. John the Lateran, as a church official theorized in 1291. “As soon as news of the exhibit will be printed in newspapers, everyone will say, ‘Finally, the Vatican has dug out the original menorah,’” Rome’s chief rabbi, Riccardo Di Segni, joked on Monday. “There is no more diffuse urban legend than this one,” he said. Believers in this and other myths surrounding the menorah, he said, “will be greatly disappointed, I hope. ”	1
73	SHANGHAI  —   Until he was appointed manager of a Taco Bell in China, Will Cao had never seen a taco before. When confronted with its hard,   shell in Los Angeles last June, he wondered: How do you eat it? “Everything was spilling all over the place,” said Mr. Cao, a    Shanghai resident. “Then I looked at the other customers to learn that, actually, you are supposed to tilt your neck to eat it. ” Mr. Cao’s employer is betting that other Chinese diners will figure it out. Yum China, the company behind KFC there, last month opened the first Taco Bell in China in years, and says it plans to open an unspecified number more. The company is turning to   tacos and overstuffed quesadillas in hopes of regaining ground in a market where its fried chicken has shown the limits of its appeal. It won’t be easy. First, there is the matter of what’s on the menu: Mexican food. Tacos and burritos are virtually unknown in China, where many diners prize aspirational noshes from America, Japan and Europe and look skeptically at what they see as poorer fare from other developing countries. Then there is Taco Bell’s very American take on Mexican meals. Even among fans, many of its more   menu items are best considered   guilty pleasures. “It’s like a dirty thing that I love Taco Bell so much,” the actress Anna Kendrick once said on Conan O’Brien’s talk show, adding, “it has to be under cover of darkness in my car. ” For its new store in Shanghai, Taco Bell is leaving behind some of those greasy American favorites, such as taco shells made out of Doritos or fried chicken cutlets. Instead, as it once successfully did with KFC, Yum China is tailoring the menu to local tastes. It is offering basic, understandable   fare such as a crunchy taco supreme and a chicken quesadilla. Other dishes made for the Chinese market include a shrimp and avocado burrito and a spicy fried chicken dish, a meal that has broader appeal with the Chinese. And in a feature rare in America  —   perhaps for good reason  —   the China store offers Japanese beer and alcoholic slushes. Yum China is aware of the magnitude of the challenge. Micky Pant, its chief executive, says eating a taco is “a whole new way of learning. ” The company is learning its own lessons. In the 1990s, Chinese consumers flocked to KFC and other Western   chains, drawn by their clean bathrooms and    —   a novelty in China at that time. But restaurants like McDonald’s and KFC have since struggled against increasing competition from   Chinese restaurant chains and a shift toward healthier eating. While China is still a lucrative market for companies including Apple, Nike and Starbucks, other American firms are finding the going tougher than it used to be. The once seemingly insatiable appetite for all things foreign has stalled in a marketplace where domestic brands are catching up and consumers are richer, with more choices than ever. Big American   chains are now distancing themselves from their China operations. Yum Brands divested Yum China last year, while McDonald’s is selling a controlling stake in its business to a locally led investor group. That led to Yum China’s gamble on Taco Bell. Instead of Taco Bell’s American approach  —   quick, cheap, often unabashedly junky  —   the Shanghai restaurant seems intent on easing Chinese diners into ordering. The menu in China features enlarged images of foods on a lighted board and a transparent kitchen, where skeptical customers can watch their food being assembled. Yum dropped fajitas because focus groups said Chinese people did not like the “peppery type of spiciness that Westerners like,” said Jimmy Chen, senior director of Yum China’s brand development division. Chinese consumers wanted warm cheese on their tacos, not the cold grated variety offered in the United States. They asked for alcohol to be offered. The bean burrito was “controversial,” Mr. Chen said while some Chinese who had studied abroad considered it a must, others found two types of starches layered on top of one another unfamiliar. Ultimately the bean burrito was booted. Said Mr. Chen, “We just need a little more time. ” Yum has tried Taco Bell in China before. In 2003 it opened   restaurants called “Taco Bell Grande” in Shanghai, then in the southern city of Shenzhen, offering   fare like steaks and fajitas. But it pulled out five years later. “They had little Chinese girls with sombreros on them looking ridiculous,” said Joel Silverstein, president of the consultancy East West Hospitality Group and a former senior executive with PepsiCo restaurants, the onetime parent of Yum Brands. “That was a complete disaster. ” Still, Yum once seemed to have cracked the China code. Since opening its first KFC near Tiananmen Square in 1987, Yum has grown into the biggest Western   chain in the country, with more than 7, 300 stores in over 1, 100 cities, three times that of its rival McDonald’s. Part of the secret was localization: KFC offered fried dough sticks and congee for breakfast, while its sister brand Pizza Hut served pizzas topped with seafood and durian, a pungent fruit from Southeast Asia. But in recent years Yum has grappled with a series of   scandals in China. In 2012, Chinese news media reported that KFC chicken suppliers used antibiotics and growth hormones in their meat, news that hurt sales and prompted Yum to cut its number of suppliers. The company emphasized that its food was safe. Two years later, a Chinese   broadcaster reported that a meat supplier used by Yum was suspected of selling expired meat. Yum terminated the supplier, which was later fined about $3. 5 million by regulators in Shanghai. Sales growth weakened after both episodes, and by 2015 sales at stores that had been open for at least a year continued to decline. Adding to the decline: an increasingly sophisticated customer base that eschews Western fast food for other options. “The biggest challenge is making the connection with the younger generation,” said Ye Liyan, marketing director in China for Pizza Hut. In its own effort to refurbish, Pizza Hut is rolling out “concept stores” across China  —   in Shanghai, one features a robot waiter and a table with a   screen for customers to build their own pizzas. Taco Bell may be an unlikely restaurant to connect. “Chinese people have mostly admired things from Europe and the United States,” said Darcy Zhang, a food blogger based in Shanghai. “But Mexico itself is a developing country, and so many Chinese people would wonder why they would have to try Mexican food. ” Yum China formally opened the Taco Bell on Jan. 9 in Shanghai’s prime Lujiazui area, a popular tourist spot. The former basketball star Shaquille O’Neal, who made the famous “Taco Neck” commercial in 1995, participated in a   competition. On a recent Tuesday, the store was packed at lunch, with a   wait to get a table. Diners sat on chairs below surfboards suspended from ceilings. Workers in polo shirts served margaritas and draft beer. “If you didn’t tell me, I wouldn’t even know this was Mexican food,” said Zang Jing, 30, a bank clerk, adding that she thought the food was “not bad. ” Liu Xiaoyi, chief editor of a local food guide, said she believed Mexican food could take off in China because people are “willing to try new things. ” “They are willing to listen to people telling them, ‘You have to look at it from a different angle to appreciate it, it’s not the same as a Chinese meal but it’s also delicious,’” she said after photographing her burrito. Her friend, Zhu Li, disagreed. “It really does not look good when you eat it,” said Ms. Zhu, 45, an insurance agent. “It’s all over your hands and dripping on the table. It just makes me uncomfortable. ”	1
402	HOLBROOK, Ariz.  —   The teenage boys amble off the school bus like so many old souls, knees and backs stiff, eyes puffy and hollowed. The previous evening this Navajo basketball troop from Chinle High School had played a rollicking game against the Monument Valley Mustangs, on the northern edge of the Navajo Nation. The boys from Chinle went on a late run and won the game. Their trip back home took three hours, their school bus rolling through moonlit mountain passes and mesas, and plains. The boys fell into bed well past midnight. Then they woke up and boarded the bus again, this time riding two hours south for a Saturday afternoon game here in Holbrook, a high prairie crossroads. These Navajo teenagers are practitioners of “rez ball,” a       style of hoops. They deeply desire a state championship. They also are perched on that precarious cliff wall between adolescence and manhood, and that brings other questions and yearnings. The seniors study college catalogs and wonder if they should leave their starkly beautiful land of family and clans, a reservation that is bigger than West Virginia. Hope and fear jostle. Nachae Nez, a    shooting guard, a senior and a fine student, sits in the bleachers and talks of a future that feels as alive as a snake in his hands. He lives in a small town tucked against the red sandstone flanks of the Chuska Mountains. He dreams of attending a   college. “They say it’s hard for natives to leave the rez,” he says. “Your favorite place if you’re a Navajo, it’s your grandmother’s hogan,” he adds, using the Navajo word for a house built in a traditional and sacred style. He pauses. “I know I need to leave if I want to be of service to my people. ” He peers at me. “These choices are painful, right?” Cooper Burbank is the youngest Chinle player, a preternaturally calm and talented freshman who deals with his own dislocation. He grew up in the red mesa northlands and attended a    middle school of 108 students. His parents  —   his mom is a teacher and his father a custodian  —   wanted him to attend a bigger school, with more course offerings, to prepare for college. So they took a hard swallow and left grandmother and cousins and clans behind and moved to Chinle, where the high school has more than 1, 000 students and the family, Cooper and parents, are outsiders. Many weekends, the Burbanks travel back to their village. “I like to go home and clear my head,” Cooper says. He adds, softly: “My life needs challenges. I know that. ” Several months ago Raul Mendoza, 69, the widely admired coach of the Wildcats, invited me to watch him try to revive the Chinle team. Last season, before he took over, the Wildcats finished   this year, the Wildcats will finish  . My wife, Evelyn, and I lived in a trailer on the Navajo Nation years ago. She was a midwife and delivered babies. We wandered this land with our young sons, and Navajo sank its hook deep into us. The chance to return and explore the passions that drive this coach and his Navajo teenagers proved irresistible. After my trip in December, I wrote of Mendoza’s story. Half Mexican and half Tohono O’odham, a child who picked cotton in the   fields of Arizona, he is a lifelong wanderer. I’ve returned to explore the lives of his teenage players. Chinle sits 5, 500 feet above sea level, west of Canyon de Chelly, where in the 1860s the Navajo held out against Kit Carson and federal troops who had come to destroy their crops and burn their homes. Basketball is a passion here. Chinle has 4, 500 residents, and its high school arena, the Wildcat Den, seats 7, 000. Fans drive and hitchhike 50, 60, 80 miles to games. Coaches are regularly tossed aside after a single losing season. Most of the teenage players observe traditional beliefs: They bow to the four sacred mountain peaks of Navajo they carry corn pollen in case their path crosses that of the coyote, a notorious trickster they swallow a bitter herb before games to guard against envy, jealousy and witchcraft. One senior wears his unshorn hair in a woven pony tail. He will cut it at age 18 and present the locks to his grandfather. As they wander canyons, they listen for the voices of ancestors. Before each game, a girl sings the national anthem in Navajo. Harsh winds blow through as well. Some parents are racked by hunger for booze and disappear others lose jobs and are evicted. The median annual income in Chinle is $27, 000. In surrounding villages, it is half that. Marcus Litson, a    senior forward with a shaggy mane and easy smile, grew up in the same town as Nachae, who is the team captain. They roamed forests and climbed sandstone buttes. In his telling, his boyhood sounds like an idyll. He also lived four years on the distant New Mexico side of the reservation. Why? “My mom and dad split, and Mom won me in seventh grade,” he says. “When I got to 16, the court made me choose who to live with. ” Marcus missed his cousins and clans, and he chose to go back to Tsaile with his father. What did his mom say? “I haven’t heard from her in a year,” he says. He turns away and whispers, “I think she took it hard. ” Darrian Yeahquo, a   junior, wanders by. His father disappeared when he was a toddler, and his mother moved the family to Albuquerque. He found city high schools tough and scary. Last spring, his grandfather, a Vietnam veteran crippled by broken knees and lingering war shock, could no longer care for his ranch and asked for help. Darrian hopped the bus to Navajo. All summer long he and a favorite cousin rode horses and tended sheep and cattle. His grandmother made sandwiches for her teenage herders and tied their lunch to a gnarled pine tree. Darrian   himself in a dream. “If I have to leave the rez to go to college, to learn irrigation to help my family and people, I will,” he says. “This time I know I am coming back. ” Nachae and Cooper remain the team pillars. Nachae feels the urgency to win that comes with a senior’s sense of time fleeting Cooper is the team’s future. After practice, they remain in the darkened arena: Cooper shoots at one end of the court Nachae shoots at the other. Mendoza walks me out of the gym. “Natives, we’re not expected to be successful, and sometimes I worry that my kids feel that way,” he says. “There’s nothing wrong with not achieving your goal, but you have to fight. ” He nods at Nachae and Cooper. “Those boys are intelligent and fight hard. ” The Wildcats remain a team half formed and maddeningly inconsistent. Sometimes forwards toss up errant   and point guards tumble toward the hoop with no discernible plan. Mendoza enjoys a tortured relationship with rez ball. He appreciates that generations of natives grew up on this   style of play. At its best, it is artful and breathtaking. He prefers when his players settle into defensive crouches, or when they pass and pass until they find an open man. “Are we going to play rez ball or are we going to play this game the right way?” he told his teenagers. “It bothers me when you can’t see the open man. ” Before I arrived, the Wildcats scored an upset of Ganado, which had been the only undefeated team on the reservation. Then they ran Monument Valley’s team off the court. They swell with confidence in Holbrook. This gym, however, is freighted with history. Mendoza once was Holbrook’s coach. He won a championship here, and Arizona coach of the year honors, and his departure still upsets some fans. Nachae played here as a freshman, and he has former teammates and friends here, and that brings pressure, too. The Wildcats begin strongly. Nachae hits a jumper and tosses down a   and drives to the basket. Cooper wrestles rebounds and hits that soft dagger of a jumper. Just as suddenly, the tempo shifts: The Wildcats throw up   jumpers. Nachae misses layups and grows frustrated. The Wildcat players stop swinging the ball to Cooper, who remains reluctant to impose his will. The game gallops away, and the Wildcats lose,  . Mendoza does not hide his displeasure. You came in here laughing, he tells his team. Your play was embarrassing. Nachae pulls his jersey up over his face. Failure pierces deeply he wants to lead. He raises his hand and says, “We’re a really good team, but we have trouble connecting with each other. ” Cooper listens, his face opaque. On Sunday morning, a photographer and I drive north to Rock Point. We join Cooper and his family at a God’s Grace Fellowship church on a rutted dirt road two miles north of the general store. The congregation numbers a few dozen, the men wearing cowboy boots and hats, jeans and dress shirts, the women in dresses and Navajo turquoise jewelry. The Bible is written in Navajo. In a kind nod to their visitors, the female pastors translate the service into English. At the end, Cooper walks up to a pastor and holds his palms out. She grasps his hands, and they pray together for the strength to face down his challenges. Afterward, we drive with the Burbank family to a tiny   restaurant, the only joint for many miles. Cooper’s mother, Joni, explains that she and her husband became fast friends in elementary school they began dating in high school. Both of their fathers died because of drunken driving. “I came from a   home he was raised by his grandmother,” Joni says. “We were magnets attracting. ” Joni attended high school and college in Flagstaff. Her husband, Darrick, worked construction and rode rodeo bulls. One night they drove to San Francisco just to smell the salt air. They married, and when Cooper, the first of their four children, arrived they agreed: no drinking, an intact family. Darrick gave up good construction dollars in the boom towns of Las Vegas and Phoenix to work maintenance at the local school. “I had a hard time with that at first,” he says. “But I didn’t have a dad. My job is to give these kids a dad. ” Joni taught at the elementary school twice she had Cooper as her student. They joined a church and stayed close to cousins and elders. They are building a hogan atop a mesa with a Navajo name that they say is too long to translate into English. Change beckoned as Cooper reached eighth grade. Within the context of a   reservation of 175, 000 Navajo, Chinle is a bustling town. The Burbanks now live in an apartment there. “Cooper needed the challenge I needed professional growth,” Joni says. “I prayed and did a lot of searching. Then I said to myself: ‘Joni, Cooper, it’s time to push yourselves. ’” They bade goodbye to Joni’s mother, Virginia Tsosie, whose trailer sits 25 yards from their own in Rock Point, near the smooth folds of   cliffs. Tsosie misses them greatly. When Cooper arrives back each weekend he walks into Grandma’s trailer and flops on her couch, and she massages his legs and tells him stories. Talk of distant schools stirs trepidation in those of Tsosie’s generation. When she was very young, the Bureau of Indian Affairs sent her to an    boarding school. She went many months without seeing her parents. Tribal culture was treated as backward, a skin to be shed in pursuit of assimilation. When Tsosie spoke Navajo to a friend, a teacher washed out her mouth with soap. “I gagged,” she recalls. “Now I talk to my grandchildren in Navajo all the time. They know the survival words. ” The winter sun sinks toward the buttes. Cooper excuses himself, grabs a basketball and walks outside, followed by his younger brothers. He dribbles on the red dirt and shoots at a backboard with a hoop twisted like broken foot. Swish, and swish, and swish. We say goodbyes and drive south to the high country village of Tsaile, which in Navajo means water flowing into a canyon. Nachae, the team captain, meets us by the gas station. We clamber into his pickup truck and bounce up an icy and rutted track to his family’s trailer. He hops out and points to the trailers next door. That one is my grandma. And that one, too. And that one, that’s my auntie. His mom, Andrea Nez, comes to the door and smiles. “No secrets around here,” she says. Nachae attended three high schools in four years. After his freshman year in Holbrook, he spun to the hoop and tore up his knee. He had surgery and needed six months before he could walk unaided. That, he figured, was that for hoops. He enrolled in Navajo Prep, a private school in Farmington, N. M. where academics are king. “I figured books were my way out,” he says. A physical therapist helped him rebuild his knee. He played as a junior and led Prep in scoring. Then a flour plant laid off his mother, and the money dried up. He left Navajo Prep and returned to Tsaile, where he enrolled at Chinle for his senior year. Nachae’s Navajo name is Napi. He tells me it means Old Man in Navajo and in Blackfoot, which is his mother’s tribe. That means you are wise, I reply. He smiles, wistful, and points to the knee he ices after every game and his sore shoulder. “Maybe it just means I have an old body. ” Like so many Navajo, he occupies several worlds. As a child he danced powwow, shot bow and arrow and dreamed of following his father, Felix, who rode serious rodeo bulls. He sees a world alive with spirits. He also has fine grades, serves on the student council and has an auntie who graduated from Cornell as a guide star. He is aware of the world outside the reservation. He has eyes on New Mexico State and its agriculture program. Last summer, he traveled the Navajo Nation reservation helping with a wool buyback program, aimed at reinvigorating the sheep industry. “I want to get educated to help my people,” he says. He drops us by our car. Tsaile sits at 7, 100 feet, adrift in snow. The night sky is kaleidoscopic with stars. The next night the Wildcats drop a fierce game to Page. They are limping into the playoffs. As suddenly, the Wildcats kick into gear. Their playoff opener is against Holbrook, and their defense goes taut. Chinle wins by a basket. Next up is Blue Ridge High School, a powerhouse with a record of  . The Wildcats should be an afterthought. Nachae, in his final high school game, has perhaps his finest performance. He scores 28 points, a whirlwind. Cooper scores 12 and plays fierce defense. The Wildcats lose only in the final minute,  . Mendoza is   taciturn compliments fall sparing as bread crumbs from his mouth. “I told the kids that we were just a few possessions from advancing,” he says. “They finally learned to compete and battle. I’m very proud of our efforts. ” Now Nachae pivots. He must spend his days deciphering college dreams. Cooper must prepare himself for a new leadership role next year. As for me, I drive out of Navajo, past buttes and cliffs under a frozen dawn sky scraped clean of clouds. The sensation is of doors opening.	1

353	BALTIMORE  —   The FedEx package containing the junior lightweight championship belt, intended for Gervonta Davis, arrived at the gym too early in the day. Davis often trains late into the night, running the streets of Baltimore, and sleeps until midday. So it was his coach Calvin Ford  —   he sleeps much less, sometimes just an hour a night  —   who found the   note when he got to Upton Boxing Center, a gym in one of the city’s most blighted neighborhoods. Ford, along with Kenny Ellis, another of Davis’s coaches, runs the training sessions at Upton five nights a week, showing young people the angles of the trade and keeping them off the same streets that Davis makes his training ground. The coaches have been involved with fighting, in one way or another, for most of their lives. Ellis, 49, is a bearded former amateur boxer who has coached at Upton since 2005. And Ford, 52, was once a violent lieutenant in the   drug organization, which controlled parts of West Baltimore in the 1980s. “If I had to shoot you, I’d shoot you,” Ford said. “If I had to stab you, I’d stab you. If I had to beat you up with my hands, I’d beat you up with my hands. ” In 1988, Ford was convicted of racketeering and conspiracy. He served 10 years in a federal prison, where he learned to box. He started coaching after he was released, eventually cultivating a national amateur champion. That attracted the attention of Ed Burns, a police detective who had investigated Ford  —   and who became one of the creators of the HBO series “The Wire. ” He used Ford as a model for the character known as Cutty, an   who opened a gym after realizing that the streets he returned to had grown harder than he could handle. Today, Ford is a   man who wears track suits and reading glasses secured by a bejeweled chain, a jarringly endearing detail for someone who teaches others how to inflict pain efficiently. And he is a father figure to dozens of children who have been coming to him for nearly two decades for lessons that reach far beyond a   round. Davis, his first world champion, and the youngest living professional titleholder, has been called the future of boxing by no less an authority than Floyd Mayweather Jr. When Davis, 22, entered the gym a few hours later to find a heavily taped cardboard box on the reception desk, it was Ford who handed him the scissors. Inside was a   belt with a large gold logo of the International Boxing Federation, earned with a   knockout of José Pedraza, who was heavily favored, in Brooklyn on Jan. 14. “Strap me up,” Davis said through a stifled grin. Ford, wearing a beanie with #STRAPSEASON printed on the front, put the belt on the      Davis. The new champion posed for a picture under banners that included Angelo Ward, who trained here before he was shot to death in 2012, and a scowling version of Davis’s younger self, draped in belts and medals a decade ago. Now, with a new belt over his shoulder, Davis glowed. “I might walk up and down the avenue,” he said, gesturing to the street outside. Last year, 318 people were killed in Baltimore, the   homicide total for the city on record 2015 was worse. So far this year, the city is averaging nearly a murder a day. Ford and Ellis know children who were  —   and still are  —   linked to those troubling statistics. Children, forced to fend for themselves after the killing of a parent, slipping into the current of incarceration. Young men with no prospects other than the easiest one available  —   the economy of addiction. Davis, whose mother struggled with drug abuse during his youth and whose father spent time in prison for selling drugs, is one of the fortunate ones. Others have not been so lucky. “Kids fall out of school because they saw the kid that they hang with get gunned down in the street,” Ellis said. After witnessing a murder, “you got to go to school the next day!” he added. “How can you do a test? How can you pass?” The kids who come through the gym’s doors at least have a chance to learn how to cope with the hopelessness outside, where, Ellis said, violence claims “a body every day. ” “Sometimes you hear gunshots, you look around the gym, like, ‘We got some in here that ain’t getting shot,’” he said. Upton is not far from where Freddie Gray was arrested in 2015, leading to the ride in a police van that left him with a spinal cord injury that killed him a week later. The drugstore that was looted and burned during the riots after his funeral is six blocks away. The neighborhood has the largest percentage of returning criminal offenders in the state, said Nick Mosby, a former mayoral candidate and City Council member who is now a state legislator. “Any barometer of success of a community, unfortunately in that ZIP code, will typically tilt towards a very unhealthy community,” said Mosby, whose wife, Marilyn, was the state’s attorney who prosecuted the Baltimore police officers charged in Gray’s death. (None were convicted.) “Poverty level, education level, unemployment rate, health disparities, you name it. ” Mosby said the children here were facing adult issues. “At the age of 7, 8, 9, 10, they’re taking care of themselves, they’re taking care of younger siblings, they’re going out, figuring out what they’re going to eat every day. ” Upton, where it costs $65 a year to train, is a refuge. The city funds the gym, though for many years Ford helped out of his own pocket  —   including paying for trips to    competitions. “You don’t know how many cars I ran through,” Ford said, laughing. Such sacrifice has helped generate good will in the community. Upton stands apart. “You notice when you walked up on the corners, you ain’t see nobody standin’ on my corners,” Ford said. “They ain’t gonna have that nonsense around us. That show you that the people  —   city, street people  —   cares about what we are doing. ” Even with Davis’s success, and the national attention it has brought to Upton, the loss of previous fighters  —   those who the coaches said decided to “go left” and give in to the streets  —   weighs heavy. Ray Davis, a fighter Ellis trained as a teenager, is in jail after ending up on his own when his father was shot at a corner store. Ronald Gibbs, a    nationally ranked amateur, was stabbed in the heart in 2012 in a dispute defending his sister. That same year, Ward, the fighter under whose banner Gervonta Davis had his picture taken, was shot nine times. He was two fights into his professional career. “Every day, his friends would come here and wait for him to finish training so they could run the streets,” Ellis said of Ward. “I said, ‘Man, you can’t have one foot in the streets and one foot in the gym. It’s not gonna work. ’” The day that Ward was killed, Ellis said, he was in his car when he received the text. “And where he got killed was like three minutes from where I was driving, so I drove around there. And they had the yellow tape around him. ” After locking his belt in its case, Gervonta (pronounced   ) Davis drove a few blocks northwest and stood in front of the home he once shared with his mother and grandmother, a bitter wind tunnel of a block dotted with abandoned rowhouses. Garbage spilled into an alley framed by a rowhouse with no roof. An open Bible lay on a stoop, its pages fluttering. Davis pointed out a cactus a few doors down. He used to touch it every day as he walked to and from the elementary school at the end of the block, a child’s personal challenge to himself ahead of a career of stinging hands. When he was 7, Davis and one of his older brothers moved in with his grandmother, after bouncing between a group home and their uncle’s house. Being new to West Baltimore, the boys were quickly forced to defend themselves. Davis’s mother, Kenya Brown, said school officials who had contacted her about his frequent fighting had told her that he was “a menace to society,” but she insisted he was not an instigator. After her brother took Davis to Upton, and he took to the sport, “people really started trying him more,” she said. “He was   always been short,” said Brown, 43. “He had to get staples because somebody hit him in the head. ” At his gym, Ford has a policy: If one of his fighters disrespects a teacher or starts a fight at school, the fighter has to spar with everyone in the gym that night. For Davis, it was less a stick and more a carrot. “He loved it,” Ford said. “I used to have to bring guys from different cities come down here that was bigger than him, just to punish him, and then he was beatin’ them up. ” Davis’s father, Garrin, said Upton allowed his son to avoid the lure of the streets that ensnared so many others. But it took work. “He made a lot of sacrifices,” said Garrin Davis, who got clean after his last stint in prison. “A lot of the friends that he had, because he made the choice to come here, he didn’t end up where they at. ” Gervonta Davis’s defensive instincts in the ring, and his calm demeanor, hew to the style of Mayweather, who has taken on the dual role of being Davis’s promoter and mentor. He is undefeated in 17 professional fights. All but one of his victories was by knockout. His success presents new challenges: the thorny world of professional boxing, and the rigors of grooming and marketing himself to be a    star. And then there are the myriad voices in his ear. Between rounds at the Pedraza fight in January, Davis had information coming at him from the coaches in his corner and from Mayweather, who was vociferously dispensing advice from ringside. “I’ve been navigating him for years,” Ford said, ”so he’s always gonna hear my voice. But Floyd’s been to that land I haven’t been to. So he have to listen to him. ” With those challenges, however, comes opportunity. Davis’s aptitude for boxing is inexorably linked to his troubled background: There is not much in the ring that can hurt him more than the tentacles of his city’s drug trade already have. And that gives him an authenticity that rings true for his community. “His whole stance, his whole posture, his whole demeanor is Baltimore,” said Mosby, who has taken Davis to schools and juvenile prisons for outreach talks. “And these kids recognize that. Young folks will get behind an individual like Gervonta, more so than any policy that we’re able to create, more so than any other public service announcement, any other potential opportunity. ” When Davis won his title in Brooklyn in January, Ford and Mosby said, a surprisingly large contingent seemed to have made the trip to support him. “You couldn’t have told me we weren’t in Baltimore,” Mosby said. The enthusiasm from the city for one of its own is not lost on Davis. He and Ford want his next fight to be in Baltimore it would the first title bout here for a world champion from the city. Davis has chosen to remain in Baltimore, rather than uproot himself to Las Vegas to be in Mayweather’s immediate circle. By staying, he believes, he can honor the people who helped raise him  —   Ford and Ellis. “More than myself, they deserve the belt,” Davis said. “They go through a lot. You got to look at it. The people before me, the boxers that they lost. People that they put their blood, sweat and tears into. And the fighters that ‘go left,’ it’s not right for Calvin and Kenny. ”	1
558	 Yellowstone National Park has been hastily evacuated as fear of the Yellowstone Caldera’s eruption is deemed to be approaching sooner than previously expected. Researchers on-site claim that the 640,000 year-old super volcano has exhibited a sudden spike of activity which indicates that it could erupt in as little as two weeks. Yellowstone is not being evacuated and no, the supervolcano is not erupting. That is the message from park officials about a rumor prompting calls from people and media all over the country.Yellowstone Park Spokesman Al Nash says the rumor came from a website called Civic Tribune. He says no one has heard of the one-page website until now.Nash says the web page looks professional, but you can’t find out who the source is.  He says the park and surrounding businesses are getting many calls and emails. According to Nash, “What they said on their website, that was also a Facebook post, was that Yellowstone was evacuating because an eruption of the supervolcano was imminent. And they used a photograph of a volcanic eruption from the Phillipines in 1984 to illustrate their story.”The Civic Tribune‘s report was untrue in 2014 and remains so now. The Yellowstone National Park web site makes no mention of any recent  evacuation, and the National Park Service‘s web site includes no alerts about an imminent volcanic eruption. Additionally, the United States Geological Survey’s Yellowstone Volcano Observatory, which monitors “volcanic, hydrothermal, and earthquake activity in the Yellowstone Plateau region,” reports that activity in the area is at normal levels.The Yellowstone National Park Facebook page also addressed the rumor on 18 June 2016 via Facebook:	0
704	 American Billionaire and Republican Presidential Front-runner, Donald Trump, has shot a subtle warning to the Nigerian Community in the United States, after he said all Nigerians would be made to leave the country “when he becomes President”. He made the “threat” during a rally at Wichita, Kansas.According to Donald Trump, Nigerians ad Mexicans have taken all the jobs meant for honest hard working Americans.“To Make America great again, we need to get rid of the Muslims, Mexicans and the Africans, especially the Nigerians. They take all our jobs, jobs meant for honest hard working Americans, and when we don’t give them the jobs, the Muslims blow us up”, Trump said.“We need to get the Africans out. Not the blacks, the Africans. Especially the Nigerians. They’re everywhere. I went for a rally in Alaska and met just one African in the entire state. Where was he from? Nigeria!

A case in Phoenix illustrated their fears: Guadalupe García de Rayos, 35, a married mother of two who sneaked across the border 21 years ago, was deported to Nogales, Mexico, after a routine   with the federal immigration agency. Her abrupt removal “illustrates the new reality,” the Mexican government said, warning its citizens in the U. S. to “take precautions and to keep in touch with their nearest consulate. ” _____ 3. Senate battles and unexpected revelations about nominees  —   undocumented household workers, questionable stock trades, undisclosed financial holdings  —   slowed the formation of the Trump cabinet to a crawl. Betsy DeVos became education secretary only after a historic tiebreaking vote from Vice President Mike Pence  —   and an acrimonious,   vigil on the Senate floor by the chamber’s Democrats. Tom Price was confirmed as secretary of health and human services after another   marathon. This week, the Senate holds confirmation votes on Steven Mnuchin for Treasury secretary, David Shulkin to head veterans affairs and Linda McMahon for administrator of the Small Business Administration. It will also hold a hearing on Andrew Puzder, whose nomination to be labor secretary has been opposed by labor groups concerned about his heavy opposition to workplace regulation. _____ 4. #LetLizSpeak became a rallying cry after Republican senators chided and formally silenced Senator Elizabeth Warren for impugning a peer, Senator Jeff Sessions, as she opposed his nomination for attorney general by reading a 1986 letter from Coretta Scott King. The move unleashed a powerful backlash, not least among women who know what it’s like to be told to hold their tongues. As our reporter wrote: “Republicans seized her microphone. And gave her a megaphone. ” Outside Washington, Republicans in state capitals are swiftly using their newfound power  —      control in 25 states  —   to advance a wave of legislation aiming to curtail union powers and abortion rights, loosen gun regulations, expand   programs and slash taxes and spending. _____ 5. Mr. Trump made further forays into foreign relations, tempering some of his harsher statements. To secure a phone call with China’s leader, Xi Jinping, he made conciliatory comments and affirmed his commitment to America’s “One China” policy. He also pulled toward the center on Israel, saying that the nation’s move to expand its West Bank settlements is not “a good thing for peace. ” North Korea tested a ballistic missile, prompting statements of solidarity from Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan and Mr. Trump, who were at the president’s    resort in Florida for a    outing.

Nordstrom became the latest business to wander into the president’s sights when it decided to drop Ivanka Trump’s retail brand from its stores, citing poor performance. The fallout: a critical presidential tweet, a “boycott Nordstrom” movement from Trump supporters, a “support Nordstrom” push from Trump opponents, and a dizzying example of the partisan tightrope companies now walk. _____ 7. The 59th Grammy Awards are tonight (CBS, 8 p. m.

The arc of women’s working lives is changing. Compared with past generations, women are now more likely to work at every stage of their lives, including into their 60s and even 70s. Some older workers keep their jobs out of financial necessity, but economic research indicates that a growing number of women stay employed longer because they find their careers fulfilling. “I feel 40,” said Lee Ann Monfredini, above, 68 and a broker in San Francisco. “I’m really not that good at the retirement thing.

80	Michael T. Flynn, the national security adviser, resigned on Monday night after it was revealed that he had misled Vice President Mike Pence and other top White House officials about his conversations with the Russian ambassador to the United States. Mr. Flynn, who served in the job for less than a month, said he had given “incomplete information” regarding a telephone call he had with the ambassador in late December about American sanctions against Russia, weeks before President Trump’s inauguration. Mr. Flynn previously had denied that he had any substantive conversations with Ambassador Sergey I. Kislyak, and Mr. Pence repeated that claim in television interviews as recently as this month. But on Monday, a former administration official said the Justice Department warned the White House last month that Mr. Flynn had not been fully forthright about his conversations with the ambassador. As a result, the Justice Department feared that Mr. Flynn could be vulnerable to blackmail by Moscow. In his resignation letter, which the White House emailed to reporters, Mr. Flynn said he had held numerous calls with foreign officials during the transition. “Unfortunately, because of the fast pace of events, I inadvertently briefed the vice   and others with incomplete information regarding my phone calls with the Russian ambassador,” he wrote. “I have sincerely apologized to the president and the vice president, and they have accepted my apology. ” “I am tendering my resignation, honored to have served our nation and the American people in such a distinguished way,” Mr. Flynn wrote. The White House said in the statement that it was replacing Mr. Flynn with retired Lt. Gen. Joseph K. Kellogg Jr. of the Army, a Vietnam War veteran, as acting national security adviser. Mr. Flynn was an early and ardent supporter of Mr. Trump’s candidacy, and in his resignation he sought to praise the president. “In just three weeks,” Mr. Flynn said, the new president “has reoriented American foreign policy in fundamental ways to restore America’s leadership position in the world. ” But in doing so, he inadvertently illustrated the brevity of his tumultuous run at the National Security Council, and the chaos that has gripped the White House in the first weeks of the Trump administration  —   and created a sense of uncertainty around the world. Earlier Monday, Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, told reporters that “the president is evaluating the situation” about Mr. Flynn’s future. By Monday evening, Mr. Flynn’s fortunes were rapidly shifting  —   his resignation came roughly seven hours after Kellyanne Conway, a counselor to the president, said on MSNBC that Mr. Trump had “full confidence” in the retired general. And when he did step down, it happened so quickly that his resignation does not appear to have been communicated to National Security Council staff members, two of whom said they learned about it from news reports. Officials said Mr. Pence had told others in the White House that he believed Mr. Flynn lied to him by saying he had not discussed the topic of sanctions on a call with the Russian ambassador in late December. Even the mere discussion of policy  —   and the apparent attempt to assuage the concerns of an American adversary before Mr. Trump took office  —   represented a remarkable breach of protocol. The F. B. I. had been examining Mr. Flynn’s phone calls as he came under growing questions about his interactions with Russian officials and his management of the National Security Council. The blackmail risk envisioned by the Justice Department would have stemmed directly from Mr. Flynn’s attempt to cover his tracks with his bosses. The Russians knew what had been said on the call thus, if they wanted Mr. Flynn to do something, they could have threatened to expose the lie if he refused. The Justice Department’s warning to the White House was first reported on Monday night by The Washington Post. In addition, the Army has been investigating whether Mr. Flynn received money from the Russian government during a trip he took to Moscow in 2015, according to two defense officials. Such a payment might violate the Emoluments Clause of the Constitution, which prohibits former military officers from receiving money from a foreign government without consent from Congress. The defense officials said there was no record that Mr. Flynn, a retired   Army general, filed the required paperwork for the trip. Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said in a statement late Monday that Mr. Flynn’s resignation would not close the question of his contact with Russian officials. “General Flynn’s decision to step down as national security adviser was all but ordained the day he misled the country about his secret talks with the Russian ambassador,” said Mr. Schiff, noting that the matter is still under investigation by the House committee. Two other Democratic lawmakers  —   Representative John Conyers Jr. of Michigan and Representative Elijah E. Cummings of Maryland  —   called for an immediate briefing by the Justice Department and the F. B. I. over the “alarming new disclosures” that Mr. Flynn was a blackmail risk. “We need to know who else within the White House is a current and ongoing risk to our national security,” they said in a statement. Representative Devin Nunes, Republican of California and the chairman of the House intelligence committee, was supportive of Mr. Flynn until the end. “Washington, D. C. can be a rough town for honorable people, and Flynn  —   who has always been a soldier, not a politician  —   deserves America’s gratitude and respect,” Mr. Nunes said in a statement. The White House had examined a transcript of a wiretapped conversation that Mr. Flynn had with Mr. Kislyak in December, according to administration officials. Mr. Flynn originally told Mr. Pence and others that the call was limited to small talk and holiday pleasantries. But the conversation, according to officials who saw the transcript of the wiretap, also included a discussion about sanctions imposed on Russia after intelligence agencies determined that President Vladimir V. Putin’s government tried to interfere with the 2016 election on Mr. Trump’s behalf. Still, current and former administration officials familiar with the call said the transcript was ambiguous enough that Mr. Trump could have justified either firing or retaining Mr. Flynn. Mr. Trump, however, had become increasingly concerned about the continued fallout over Mr. Flynn’s behavior, according to people familiar with his thinking, and told aides that the media storm around Mr. Flynn would damage the president’s image on national security issues. Stephen K. Bannon, the president’s chief strategist, asked for Mr. Flynn’s resignation  —   a move that he has been pushing for since Friday, when it became clear that the national security adviser had misled Mr. Pence. Around 8:20 p. m. Monday, a sullen Mr. Flynn was seen in the Oval Office, just as preparations were being made for the   of newly confirmed Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin. Soon after, Mr. Flynn’s resignation letter started making the rounds. Administration officials said it was unlikely that Mr. Kellogg would be asked to stay on as Mr. Flynn’s permanent replacement. Mr. Flynn brought Mr. Kellogg into the Trump campaign, according to a former campaign adviser, and the two have remained close. K. T. McFarland, the deputy national security adviser who also was brought on by Mr. Flynn, is expected to leave that role, a senior official said. One person close to the administration, who was not authorized to discuss the personnel moves and spoke on the condition of anonymity, said that retired Vice Admiral Robert S. Harward is the leading candidate to replace Mr. Flynn, although Mr. Kellogg and David H. Petraeus are being discussed. It was not clear whether Mr. Petraeus is still expected to appear at the White House this week, as initially discussed by advisers to the president. Mr. Flynn’s concealment of the call’s content, combined with questions about his management of his agency and reports of a demoralized staff, put him in a precarious position less than a month into Mr. Trump’s presidency. Few members of Mr. Trump’s team were more skeptical of Mr. Flynn than the vice president, numerous administration officials said. Mr. Pence, who used the false information provided by Mr. Flynn to defend him in a series of television appearances, was incensed at Mr. Flynn’s lack of contrition for repeatedly embarrassing him by withholding the information, according to three administration officials familiar with the situation. Mr. Flynn and Mr. Pence spoke twice in the past few days about the matter, but administration officials said that rather than fully apologize and accept responsibility, the national security adviser blamed his faulty memory  —   which irked the typically    Mr. Pence. The slight was compounded by an episode late last year when Mr. Pence went on television to deny that Mr. Flynn’s son, who had posted conspiracy theories about Hillary Clinton on social media, had been given a security clearance by the transition team. The younger Mr. Flynn had, indeed, been given such a clearance, even though his father had told Mr. Pence’s team that he had not. Officials said classified information did not appear to have been discussed during the conversation between Mr. Flynn and the ambassador, which would have been a crime. The call was captured on a routine wiretap of diplomats’ calls, the officials said. But current Trump administration officials and former Obama administration officials said that Mr. Flynn did appear to be reassuring the ambassador that Mr. Trump would adopt a more accommodating tone on Russia once in office. Former and current administration officials said that Mr. Flynn urged Russia not to retaliate against any sanctions because an overreaction would make any future cooperation more complicated. He never explicitly promised sanctions relief, one former official said, but he appeared to leave the impression that it would be possible. During his 2015 trip to Moscow, Mr. Flynn was paid to attend the anniversary celebration of Russia Today, a television network controlled by the Kremlin. At the banquet, he sat next to Mr. Putin. Mr. Flynn had notified the Defense Intelligence Agency, which he once led, that he was taking the trip. He received a security briefing from agency officials before he left, which is customary for former top agency officials when they travel overseas. Still, some senior agency officials were surprised when footage of the banquet appeared on RT, and believed that Mr. Flynn should have been more forthcoming with the agency about the nature of his trip to Russia.	1

618	 Ending rampant speculation regarding the extent of the late musician’s catalogue of unreleased recordings, the executors of Prince’s estate announced Monday that the performer’s famed vault in his Paisley Park residence sadly contains 37,000 hours of Billy Joel covers. “Prince was constantly creating throughout his career, and after finally accessing his vast trove of previously unheard music, we now know that he produced over 40,000 albums’ worth of material that is, unfortunately, made up entirely of songs originally recorded by Billy Joel,” said attorney L. Londell McMillan, reluctantly admitting that Prince had produced at least 9,000 hours of “Uptown Girl” covers alone. The seven-time Grammy Award winner reportedly left behind a vault containing so much music his estate could put out an album a year for the next century.“We could put out more work in a month than most people could do in a year or more,” Susan Rogers, Prince’s former recording engineer, told ABC’s “Good Morning America.”Rogers added that the vault in Prince’s Paisley Park home was a giant room with shelves that filled up quickly. The door to the vault was sealed with a large spinning wheel.	0
742	 As it turns out, the Republicans may have been right all along, and President Obama is not the smartest person in the room after all. Since Woodrow Wilson took office in 1913, all presidents have been given an IQ test at some point during their time as leader. Gerald Ford always held the record for lowest score, with a 111, which is considered just slightly above average. On the other end of the spectrum, George W. Bush scored a 132, which is considered ‘gifted.’ Two-Thirds of people who take the standardized IQ test score between 85-115.The White House today spun President Obama’s 102 as a ‘solid average’ that is nothing to be ashamed of.“President Obama never claimed to be smarter than anybody else. As a matter as fact, he has always represented himself as a regular guy, ‘a man of the people,’ as it were,” said  Josh Earnest, White House Press Secretary. “The key to being a good leader is to surround yourself with smart people, which President Obama has always done. As far as needing to be a genius to run the country, well — George W. Bush had the highest score ever, and look at how that mess turned out. So, the next time President Obama bypasses congress with an executive order, and you’re about to say something cruel, racist, or otherwise completely ignorant, remember that he’s just a regular guy getting things done for you.

234	PALM BEACH, Fla.  —   Federal authorities would be empowered to immediately deport vastly more undocumented immigrants as part of a broad crackdown being developed by the Trump administration that would significantly change the way federal agencies enforce immigration laws. Two draft memos signed on Friday by John F. Kelly, the retired Marine general who is now secretary of homeland security, outline an aggressive mission for the immigration authorities that would rescind policies put in place by President Barack Obama that focused mainly on removing serious criminals. The directives appear to spare many younger immigrants brought to the country illegally as children, known as Dreamers. But some parents of children who enter unaccompanied could face prosecution under the guidelines. The approach laid out in the memos, which have not been finalized and are subject to change by the White House, reflects Mr. Trump’s campaign promise to harden the border and deport people who entered the United States illegally. He has returned to that theme in recent days: At a rally on Saturday in Melbourne, Fla. Mr. Trump highlighted a recent spate of deportations and characterized those being sent out of the country as dangerous criminals. “We will have strong borders again,” he told supporters, who cheered robustly. “You’ve seen it on television. General Kelly, now Secretary Kelly, he’s really doing the job. You’re seeing it. The gang members  —   bad, bad people. I said it Day 1. And they’re going out, or they’re being put in prison. But for the most part, get them the hell out of here. Bring them back to where they came from. ” Among the most significant changes in the memos, which were obtained by McClatchy newspapers and The Washington Post, would be an expansion of   expedited removal proceedings to cover thousands more undocumented immigrants. Under expedited removals, agents from the Border Patrol and Immigration and Customs Enforcement can deport detained individuals immediately. Under Obama administration directives, expedited removal was used only within 100 miles of the border for people who had been in the country no more than 14 days. Mr. Kelly’s memos would expand that to those who have been in the country for up to two years anywhere in the nation. The memos also call for the possible prosecution of the parents of children who arrived as unaccompanied minors and are later reunited with the parents. Under Mr. Kelly’s directive, the parents could be charged with smuggling or trafficking. But the memos appear to exempt the Dreamers, the young immigrants protected under Mr. Obama’s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, called DACA. Mr. Trump has signaled that he is not eager to completely reverse that initiative, since those young immigrants were not responsible for their entering the country illegally. “The DACA situation is a very, very  —   it’s a very difficult thing for me, because, you know, I love these kids,” Mr. Trump said at a news conference on Thursday. “I love kids. I have kids and grandkids. And I find it very, very hard doing what the law says exactly to do. And you know the law is rough. ” The White House cautioned on Sunday that the details of the directives were still being reviewed but suggested final orders may be issued this week. “None of those are final and have not been signed off by the White House,” Sarah Huckabee Sanders, a deputy press secretary for Mr. Trump, told reporters in Florida, where the president was spending the weekend. The Department of Homeland Security declined to discuss the memos. The changes in immigration enforcement, outlined in executive orders signed by Mr. Trump last month, have drawn praise from agents in the Border Patrol and Immigration and Customs Enforcement. “For the first time in my 19 years, I feel like I can do the job I was hired to do, the job they tell you you’ll be doing when you leave the academy,” said Shawn Moran, a Border Patrol agent in San Diego and spokesman for the National Border Patrol Council, the union representing 16, 000 of the agency’s 21, 000 agents. But immigration advocates called the policy changes dangerous and expressed disappointment in Mr. Kelly, who they had hoped would be a more moderate voice on immigration policy in the Trump administration because he had expressed sympathy for women and children arriving in the United States after fleeing violence in Central America. “That hope is now gone,” Tom Jawetz, the vice president of immigration policy at the Center for American Progress, a liberal research organization, said on Twitter. “The border security memo mentions Honduran, Salvadoran and Guatemalan kids coming without pretending to care why. ” Omar Jadwat, the director of the Immigrants’ Rights Project of the American Civil Liberties Union, said he hoped the administration would rethink the approach. “All of these things are unfortunately not surprising but deeply worrisome, both for the people who are going to be directly affected and for the country as a whole,” Mr. Jadwat said. “This kind of inhumane approach and the disregard for fundamental due process values that’s embodied in these memos can do real damage to our country. ” Senator Robert Menendez, Democrat of New Jersey, said that while he supported the removal of unauthorized immigrants who are dangerous criminals, Mr. Trump’s policies seemed to lump all undocumented immigrants together. “Ultimately, anyone who is found in an undocumented status would ultimately be apprehended and deported, with due process totally eroded under the proposals that I’m hearing about,” he said on “State of the Union” on CNN. “And that’s not only going to lead to massive deportations, they are going to affect every element of our society and our economic sector as well. ” Expanding the immigration authorities’ reach would require a considerable increase in resources. With an estimated 11 million people in the country illegally, the government has long had to set narrower priorities, given the constraints on staffing and money. But Mr. Kelly’s memos envision hiring 10, 000 new immigration and customs agents, expanding detention facilities and creating an office to help families of those killed by undocumented immigrants. Mr. Trump had some of those relatives address his rallies in the campaign, and several were present when he signed an executive order on immigration last month at the Department of Homeland Security. Mr. Kelly’s directives would also instruct Immigration and Customs Enforcement, as well as Customs and Border Protection, the parent agency of the Border Patrol, to begin reviving a program that recruits local police officers and sheriff’s deputies to help with deportation, effectively making them de facto immigration agents. The effort, called the 287g program, was scaled back during the Obama administration. The program faces resistance from many states and dozens of   sanctuary cities, which have refused to allow their law enforcement workers to help round up undocumented individuals. In Texas, Gov. Greg Abbott has said he will cut state funding for sanctuary cities and remove any elected official who promotes such policies. Mr. Abbott’s office canceled a $1. 5 million grant to Travis County because the newly elected Democratic sheriff, Sally Hernandez, said her department would not respond to requests from Immigration and Customs Enforcement to flag inmates for possible deportation. In Kansas, Kris Kobach, the secretary of state and a transition adviser to Mr. Trump, is promoting a bill that would require the Kansas Highway Patrol to seek agreement with the federal government to deputize state troopers to enforce immigration laws. The Highway Patrol says it was not consulted on the bill. The measure faces opposition from Democrats and some moderate Republicans.	1
84	President Trump’s old office on the 26th floor of Trump Tower in Manhattan sits unoccupied now, unofficial storage space for the gathering trove of memorabilia that his two oldest sons say they hope will eventually be turned over to their father’s presidential library. But just one flight down, in Eric and Donald Trump Jr. ’s cramped offices, their father is    —   in the seven copies of a recent issue of Golf Digest with his photo and the headline “  ” on the cover stacked on Eric’s desk in his visage looping endlessly on CNN (yes, they watch CNN) in the cardboard cutout of the president watching from behind a stash of blueprints in the corner. This is the conundrum facing the two brothers as they assume control of the empire their father built: How do they move forward, and navigate the ethical shoals, at a business predicated entirely on the brand of the man they have vowed to distance themselves from? “His DNA will always be in the company in a big way,” Eric said, during nearly five hours of interviews over two days last week at Trump Tower. “His DNA built the company. His DNA also built us. We’re extensions of him in so many ways. ” Both he and Don Jr. insist that they do not need their father’s input to run the company  —   the apprentices have become the boss. And even as questions remain about potential conflicts of interest, they say, unapologetically, that they plan to forge ahead with expanding the Trump Organization’s footprint, both in the United States and abroad. On Saturday, in fact, they will cut ribbon at their company’s newest branded property, billed as a “magnificent golf course” in the booming United Arab Emirates city of Dubai, before hundreds of Emirati power brokers. A week later they will head to Vancouver, British Columbia, for another opening celebration, of the latest Trump International Hotel and Tower, one of a dozen major international projects still underway, from the Dominican Republic to India. Back home in the United States, they are planning to open a new boutique hotel chain,  Scion, in perhaps 30 cities. With the aggressive push forward, though, comes the persistent thrum of ethical qualm. Just last week, news that Eric had traveled to the Dominican Republic to restart a stalled project there prompted controversy, given the Trump Organization’s pledge of no new overseas deals. The Washington Post reported that when Eric visited Uruguay on business in January, the trip cost taxpayers nearly $100, 000 in hotel bills for the required Secret Service agents and for embassy staff members. Also echoing through the office at Trump Tower was the   over the decision by Nordstrom and several other retailers to stop selling their sister Ivanka’s clothing line. Don Jr. called that “disgusting,” and both brothers said their father was right to take Nordstrom and other retailers to task publicly in Ivanka’s defense. “He’s Papa Bear,” Eric said. Despite pressure to do so, President Trump has not sold any of his assets, which include a stake in a   office buildings, more than a dozen golf courses and at least 15 hotels that the company owns or manages. Instead, he has signed over control of    operations of his privately held company to the two sons and Allen Weisselberg, a trusted lieutenant at the Trump Organization, with an agreement not to discuss company business. The arrangement and the president’s decision to not release his taxes have brought widespread criticism from liberal groups and even the federal government’s top ethics watchdog, Walter M. Shaub Jr. the director of the Office of Government Ethics. President Trump has continued to frequent his commercial properties, including over the weekend in Florida, bringing them global media attention and potential new customers. But the brothers say they are convinced that they and their father have taken sufficient steps to create a management structure that will allow them to avoid creating the kind of appearance of conflict of interest that plagued Hillary Clinton as secretary of state while her husband continued to operate the Clinton Foundation. The measures they have taken, they say, have included explicit instructions to their domestic and international business partners not to reach out to anyone in the United States government for help. The brothers’ expressions tightened and their voices rose when they were asked, in separate interviews, about suggestions that their father was using the presidency as a way to enhance the family’s profits. “Who in their right mind would try to enrich themselves by spending a fortune to run against 17 seasoned politicians on the Republican side, to then go up against the Clinton machine, Wall Street, Hollywood, P. C. culture?” Don Jr. asked. “To use that as the way to enrich yourself is laughable. ” The family, he added, would face heat whatever it did. If the Trump Organization sold its assets, there would be allegations of impropriety, as foreign investors would most likely be involved. If it liquidated and put the cash into the bank, he said, his father would be accused of artificially inflating interest rates for personal gain. For critics, though, particularly Democrats in Congress, the continuation of the global operations of the Trump Organization  —   even if President Trump is not directly involved  —   is fraught with problems, with even some Republican observers questioning whether the brothers can steer clear of trouble, regardless of their intentions. Even with no new foreign deals, the company is in a position to get tax breaks and other business inducements from state and local officials. While such incentives are hardly unusual for growing businesses, with this family business they will unavoidably raise questions of whether different players involved might be seeking special White House favors. “People are going to offer them sweetheart deals,” said Peter Schweizer, the conservative author whose book “Clinton Cash” argued, among other things, that Mrs. Clinton had used her position as secretary of state to favor donors to the foundation. “It is just the way it works, as it comes down to the fact that people want access to national leaders in the country, and unfortunately in the past, be it Billy Carter, Neil Bush or Roger Clinton, relatives become vehicles to accomplishing that,” Mr. Schweizer added, referring to relatives in past administrations who drew scrutiny because of their business activities. The two oldest brothers have worked in various roles at the Trump Organization for much of their adult lives, but without their father’s daily presence  —   and with the departure of Ivanka from the company offices  —   their responsibilities have grown. Eric Trump, 33, oversees construction and says he, not his father, is now the named officer on hundreds of Trump companies. Don Jr. 39, is in charge of commercial leasing, as well as many of the remaining companies. And while they share a certain      look, their personalities are distinct. Don Jr. the Trump child with the clearest memory of the divorce that split up his family, is the most publicly confident, and the most politically conservative. Eric appears more cautious, more worried about how what he says will be perceived. Yet neither is particularly shy. “There has never been a Trump that is introverted,” Eric said, laughing. What is it like  —   after a lifetime as the sons of Donald Trump, and now business executives in their own right, and even   in a reality television show  —   to be the sons of the president of the United States? “It’s bigger, it’s bigger,” Eric said, struggling for the right word, then turning to a superlative, a habit inherited from his father. “This is really the biggest thing in the world. ” For all the talk of its global reach, the Trump Organization still has a family feel to it. The small offices assigned to Eric, Ivanka and Don Jr. are lined up in a row, with Ivanka’s, like her father’s, sitting unused since she left the company and moved to Washington with her husband, Jared Kushner, who is serving as a senior White House adviser. During the recent snowstorm in New York  —   with schools closed for the day  —   Don Jr. who has five children, had his    daughter in the office, sharing breakfast sent up from a restaurant downstairs. Trump Tower, by and large, seems back to normal since the building’s most famous resident moved to Washington, though Secret Service agents are still stationed in the Trump Organization lobby and elsewhere. Just days before his inauguration in January, Mr. Trump announced plans to resign from hundreds of entities he controls and place his assets in a trust. The move drew sharp criticism from ethics lawyers, who said the move was window dressing because Mr. Trump, as sole beneficiary of the trust, still owns the assets, benefits financially from any money they might make and will quite likely get updates, Eric said, roughly every quarter on the financial health of the company. Still, President Trump assigned control of the trust to Don Jr. and Mr. Weisselberg, with Eric as the sole member of what he described as an advisory council. The three men have to vote unanimously, Eric said, to make decisions regarding new deals and other major business decisions. To Don Jr. everything the company does these days seems to breed controversy. Much of it he says is unwarranted. For instance, people have questioned why corporate records in Delaware do not show that the president has resigned from his companies registered there. Eric says that he has, but that it can take more than a year for records there to be updated. And the brothers expressed irritation that their presence at their father’s announcement of Judge Neil M. Gorsuch to fill the Supreme Court vacancy provoked media reports that they were not honoring the agreement to stay clear of White House matters. In fact, they said, they were in Washington to visit the new Trump hotel in the Old Post Office Building on Pennsylvania Avenue and stopped by to say hello to their father and share in the historic moment. Don Jr. said he knew his father was busy, and had called him only once since his inauguration. Eric said he talked to his father “a few” times a week. But he insisted he knew which lines not to cross. “In the next four years, do I ever expect him to say: ‘Hey, how’s Turnberry? How’s the new green? How’s the new 10th tee? ’” Eric said. In a case like this, he said, he would probably say, “Dad, it’s great” and “The property looks awesome. ” He continued: “Am I ever going to say: ‘Listen. Hey, we have a tax issue’? No, no, no. There’s a difference. ” Recently the brothers stripped most of the photographs of their father and even his signature from the Trump Organization’s marketing material. And the new Scion hotel chain, which the company will brand and manage, does not feature the Trump name. Eric said they were hoping to locate Scion, offering a   alternative to their Trump International Hotel brand, in large to midsize “trendy” cities like Austin, Tex. Charlotte, N. C. and Nashville. One of the first Scion locations, Eric said, could be Dallas, where the brothers and their executive team are evaluating possible sites. They are in talks with a possible partner, Mukemmel Sarimsakci, a developer based in Texas who had previously considered projects with the Trump Organization in Iraq and Turkey, where he was born. Though the company runs the risk of becoming entangled with foreign partners on projects in the United States, and might have to deal with the suspicion that it got tax breaks and other incentives from local governments because of its ties to the White House, company officials say they decided not to stop domestic expansion because it is creating jobs for Americans. The Trump Organization said it had dropped a host of proposed projects overseas, including Trump Office Buenos Aires in Argentina Trump Towers Rio and Trump Hotel Rio de Janeiro, both in Brazil Trump International Hotel  Tower Baku in Azerbaijan Trump Tower Batumi in Georgia and Trump Riverwalk in Pune, India. Other deals still in the conceptual stage  —   including a possible office building in Dubai and towers in Australia, China, Israel and Vietnam  —   have also been shelved. “I was the first person to raise my hand and say you should not do certain deals, as I understood the optics, as you can’t build the tallest building in Tel Aviv and try to negotiate peace in the Middle East,” Eric said. He estimated that the company had canceled a billion dollars’ worth of deals  —   although this estimate could not be confirmed independently. Still, the company will continue to see through the dozen projects that the brothers say were underway before Inauguration Day and so do not qualify as new. They include two resorts in Indonesia Trump Tower Mumbai and a Trump tower in Gurgaon, also in India Trump Tower Punta del Este in Uruguay and a second golf club in Dubai, as well as the Dominican Republic resort, which was started in 2007 but stalled during the financial crisis. “That doesn’t mean the deal doesn’t continue to exist,” Eric said, amid the criticism last week that the project was a “new deal. ” Another Trump property in the ethical spotlight lately is    the oceanside estate turned private club in Palm Beach, Fla. that the president is styling as his winter White House. Mr. Trump arrived there again on Friday for a golfing visit with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan. “There should be no intermingling of White House and business operations,” said Robert Weissman, president of Public Citizen, who is troubled whether the president hosts the Japanese prime minister for free  —   at a commercial operation  —   or charges him, which would mean a foreign government official is paying Mr. Trump’s family. “There should be no intermingling of his private moneys with public affairs. ” Eric dismissed the questions as meaningless, comparing    to the Crawford, Tex. ranch of former President George W. Bush. He said his father was without peer when it came to forging friendships on the golf course, and his eyes grew wide as he talked about the family resort’s potentially becoming a place where world alliances are struck. To the Trump family, that mixing of business and officialdom  —   at least when it comes to their father’s visits  —   is just fine. “If he could do that with Putin, if he could do that with some of these horrible actors around the world who only want to compromise us as a country, and he can make them friends and they can have trust in one another, he just did something that not many presidents have been able to do,” Eric said.	1
934	 Law enforcement officials in Longview, Texas, have held a press conference to announce they believe a vigilante targeting pedophiles is on the loose, with reports that three local offenders have been found dead over the past week.Authorities are appealing for any information regarding the murders, which have claimed the lives of three men on the Texas Sex Offender Registry for crimes involving offences against children.“We urge whoever is committing these murders to stop immediately and turn themselves in,” said one officer. “While we understand the community’s attitude to pedophiles, there is no way in a civilised society that we can accept this sort of vigilantism.”	0
117	(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the  .) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. The resignation of Michael Flynn as President Trump’s national security adviser has added to the impression that the White House is in chaos, and that the U. S. security apparatus is, as Senator John McCain said, “dysfunctional. ” If Mr. Flynn was not entirely honest with the F. B. I. about his conversations with a Russian ambassador, it could expose him to a felony charge. Mr. Trump knew for weeks, his spokesman said, that Mr. Flynn had misled the vice president about the conversations. His departure dampened hopes of improving   relations, just as news broke that Moscow had secretly deployed a new cruise missile in what U. S. officials said was a violation of the landmark arms control treaty that helped end the Cold War. _____ 2. Mr. Trump is scheduled to meet tomorrow with Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. A likely topic of conversation is the “ ” approach to a   solution: building relationships with Arab countries worried about Iran and getting them to press the Palestinians in negotiations. Such an approach has been tried before, without success. Today’s episode of our new podcast, The Daily, considers the prospects now. Listen here if you’re on a computer, here if you’re on an iOS device or here for an Android device. _____ 3. The police in Malaysia are searching for two women in the assassination of the half brother of the North Korean leader, Kim   in an attack that may have used poisoned needles at a Kuala Lumpur airport. The half brother, Kim   was once considered the heir to power, but he had been living in   for years. South Korea’s governing party called the killing a “naked example of Kim  ’s reign of terror. ” _____ 4. “We finally have some measure of justice. ” That was the father of Etan Patz, the    Manhattan boy who went missing almost 40 years ago, forever changing the way parents watched over their children. He spoke after a former Greenwich Village deli worker, Pedro Hernandez, was found guilty of murder and kidnapping in the case. _____ 5. The threat of catastrophic flooding from the damaged Oroville Dam in Northern California this week is a warning sign for the state, where a network of dams and waterways is suffering from age and stress. Climate change is exacerbating the challenges. Engineers and environmentalists said problems like Oroville’s damaged spillway could occur at many of the more than 1, 000 dams that dot the state. “When you build a dam, you are playing God,” one engineer said. “And it’s tough to be God. ” _____ 6. An influential science advisory group lent its support to a   proposition: human genetic engineering. It’s an ethical minefield, and the group only endorsed the practice to prevent babies from being born with genes known to cause serious diseases and disabilities. The group acknowledged concerns that scientists could try to engineer traits like beauty, strength or intelligence  —   like something out of a dystopian   novel  —   and said they were trying to ensure that the technique was used for the right purposes. _____ 7. India’s air pollution is surpassing China’s as the deadliest in the world. A new study found that smog in India is causing about 1. 1 million premature deaths a year and rising, while China’s rate has stabilized. _____ 8. After trying in 1853 to determine the origins of Valentine’s Day, The Times called it “one of those mysterious historical or antiquarian problems which are doomed never to be solved. ” Here is a guide to some of the competing theories, including that it emerged from a Roman fertility rite, or possibly to honor the martyrdom of St. Valentine. Now, if you’ve received flowers, some tips on how to keep them fresh longer: Clip the ends under warm running water and keep them out of direct light. Chrysanthemums and carnations are sturdier than roses, which are unlikely to last more than a week. Romantic movie recommendations, on the other hand, are forever. (O. K. sort of.) _____ 9. A walk behind the scenes at the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show can be overwhelming. But our photographer took a close look, and his photos reveal what makes each breed unique. Pilot, the chow chow above, won best in breed. The chow chow’s   tongue is perhaps its most distinctive feature. _____ 10. Finally, we’re continuing our roundup of the best of   comedy. Last night, the comedians set their sights on the White House  —   especially Stephen Miller, above, the architect of some of Mr. Trump’s most explosive executive orders Betsy DeVos, the new education secretary and, of course, Michael Flynn. And if you want a break from politics, here’s a selection of the best nonpolitical stuff to read, watch and listen to from around the internet.

464	Tornadoes lashed the Midwest on Tuesday, killing at least three people and leaving a trail of splintered homes, razed businesses and power losses. The severe weather extended into Wednesday, and forecasters said the   and Deep South were also at risk for dangerous conditions. The authorities in Illinois said at least two people had died in the state, and Missouri officials reported one fatality after a frightening stretch of storms barreled through the region. A handful of homes were destroyed in Perryville, Mo. where one person died, and the Missouri Department of Public Safety said that some travelers along Interstate 55 had been affected. The National Weather Service said it was sending teams to survey storm damage, and the American Red Cross was opening shelters in the region, where officials reported dozens of injuries. The Weather Service warned that Kentucky, Tennessee and Virginia were most likely to endure severe storms on Wednesday, though forecasters also said there was an “enhanced” risk for severe weather in parts of Alabama, Georgia, Mississippi, Ohio, Pennsylvania and West Virginia. “Damaging winds are the primary severe threat,” the Weather Service said, “though a few tornadoes and hail will be possible, especially west of the Appalachians. ”	1
203	HONG KONG  —   A major corporate executive sits in jail, accused of participating in a corruption scandal that could topple a country’s top leader. In most places, that image would probably fuel a campaign to clean up incestuous links between business and government. That situation is now unfolding in South Korea  —   but the prospects for a major housecleaning look uncertain. The unprecedented arrest on Friday of the de facto leader of Samsung, the largest company in the country, highlighted once again the outsize political influence of the largest   companies there. Critics of their power cheered the arrest of Lee   Samsung’s vice chairman, as a major step toward curbing that authority. Still, others warned that the arrest would not necessarily lead to the sweeping changes they say South Korea needs to fight corruption and overhaul its economy. The arrest was “just the beginning,” said Sim   an opposition lawmaker who has campaigned for transparency at the largest companies. She warned against a tendency among the law enforcement agencies to treat major corporate chiefs with kid gloves. “We needed to see whether prosecutors ask for a sentence befitting his crimes and whether he is convicted with such a penalty,” Ms. Sim said. “Only when he finishes serving such a lengthy sentence will people believe that the law is alive in their country. ” It also raises questions about the fate of Samsung, a huge company whose electronics arm alone accounts for   of South Korea’s exports. Wearing a   suit, Mr. Lee emerged through the metal detectors of a court in Seoul, the capital, on Thursday and past a news media gantlet to his car, which drove him to a detention center to await a decision. Early Friday morning, he learned that he would be staying at the detention center through his trial. South Korea faces a tenuous balancing act. For decades, its growth has been fueled by companies like Samsung, one of a group of   conglomerates called chaebol. Chaebol are now firmly embedded in the country’s economy, with the 10 largest generating annual revenue exceeding 80 percent of South Korea’s gross domestic product. Business groups warn that disrupting the chaebol could hurt the broader economy. “We are shocked and deeply worried,” the Korea Employers Federation, a   lobby, said in a statement about the arrest. “Samsung is the global company that represents South Korea, and we fear that the vacuum in its management will weigh heavily on the economy by increasing uncertainty and hurt international credibility. ” But the power of the chaebol is coming up against rising public anger over the perception of corruption and favoritism. Among those 10 biggest chaebol, six of their leaders have been convicted of   crimes. Many have been pardoned or had their sentences suspended or reduced. Chaebol leaders face broader questions as well about whether their economic dominance squelches small business and innovation, accusations that their lobbyist denies. Reflecting the public mood, the governing  —   and usually    —   Liberty Korea Party said it respected the court’s decision to arrest Mr. Lee and expressed “regrets that the people have been again disappointed by the   collusion between politics and business. ” Mr. Lee is accused of bribery, embezzlement and perjury as part of an investigation into a confidante of the country’s president, Park  . Ms. Park now faces impeachment. Samsung has said Mr. Lee will work to clear his name in court. The police arrested Mr. Lee and took him into custody, an unprecedented move for a major Samsung official. But in terms of accusations of wrongdoing against a top executive, Samsung has been there before. Mr. Lee’s father, Lee   Samsung’s chairman, has twice been convicted of bribery and tax evasion. Still, the elder Mr. Lee never spent time in prison. The fate of the young Mr. Lee, critics of the chaebol say, will be a test of the country’s young democracy and judicial system. It will also be a test for Samsung. For the first time in its   history, the company has been left leaderless. With Mr. Lee gone, there is no top executive to make   plans and strategic decisions. Samsung has an army of professional executives that manage    operations of its 58 subsidiaries. But analysts say that without a   leader, decision making will slow. In chaebol culture, often likened to an imperial monarchy within South Korea, the chairman must endorse or make corporate decisions. So the removal of Mr. Lee, who has been the de facto leader since his father was incapacitated by a heart attack  in 2014, is far more serious than the loss of a senior executive at a conventional company. Choi   the No. 2 lieutenant in the Samsung hierarchy and longtime   man for Mr. Lee, will be the closest substitute to a top manager at the company while Mr. Lee is gone. But Mr. Choi is not a member of the Lee family and is expected to serve largely as a “vassal” caretaker who lacks the kind of sweeping authority and responsibility that Mr. Lee and his father have wielded in placing   bets on investments or new technology. In one sign of disruption, Samsung delayed its annual reshuffle of senior managers, which it usually announces in December. Compounding concerns, Mr. Choi and his deputies are also being investigated by prosecutors in connection with the bribery scandal. The arrest comes at a difficult time for Samsung’s electronics arm. The company has faced stiff competition from Apple and cheaper Chinese smartphone makers alike. It is also still recovering from the discontinuation of its Galaxy Note 7, after flaws led some of the phones to overheat and burst into flames. Still, few believe Mr. Lee’s arrest will challenge the family’s ultimate control of the company. In 2008, facing corruption charges, Mr. Lee’s father resigned from management, leaving the company to be run by loyal deputies, who served the family for decades and whose responsibilities were to ensure the    transfer of power. For Samsung, one test will be whether the argument that its fate is important to the South Korean economy carries the same weight. When huge crowds took to the streets on recent weekends to call for the impeachment of Ms. Park, they also called for the arrest of chaebol chairmen accused of playing a crucial role in the presidential scandal. On Friday, Moon   the opposition leader who tops surveys of potential candidates to replace Ms. Park, called the arrest “proof that justice is still alive in South Korea. ”	1
604	 The pro-life movement in the United States has long advocated their stance that human life begins at conception and that the human fetus is a person and therefore has a right to live. However, a new argument has taken flight over the last month that is taking the abortion debate to the next level. The variety in opinion on the issue of abortion is reflected in the diverse views of religious groups, but now pro-lifers are declaring “ejaculation is murder” and they want strict laws against the practice.“Life begins BEFORE conception. This is why the Catholics do not believe in birth control,” said Rachel Stratt, pro-life activist. “God made men’s semen for a purpose, and you can just “waste” that purpose by gratifying yourself whenever you want to. Every time you do, you are literally killing thousands of babies! Ejaculation is murder and every sperm cell is a life!”Stratt and her group of protesters are calling for a law that will make ejaculating for self gratification illegal in every state across the country. “Millions upon millions of innocent lives are wasted every day while men have lustful thoughts or watch those sick p*rnos on P*rnHub.

278	In the days leading up to and after Betsy DeVos’s confirmation as secretary of education, a hashtag spread across Twitter: #publicschoolproud. Parents and teachers tweeted photos of their kids studying, performing, eating lunch together. People of all races tweeted about how public schools changed them, saved them, helped them succeed. The hashtag and storytelling was a rebuttal to DeVos, who called traditional public schools a “dead end” and who bankrolled efforts to pass reforms in Michigan, her home state, that would funnel public funds in the form of vouchers into religious and privately operated schools and encouraged the proliferation of   charter schools. The tweets railed against DeVos’s labeling of public schools as an industry that needed to adopt the   principles of competition and choice. #Publicschoolproud was seen as an effort to show that public schools still mattered. But the enthusiastic defense obscured a larger truth: We began moving away from the “public” in public education a long time ago. In fact, treating public schools like a business these days is largely a matter of fact in many places. Parents have pushed for   policies that encourage shopping for public schools that they hope will give their children an advantage and for the expansion of charter schools that are run by private organizations with public funds. Large numbers of public schools have selective admissions policies that keep most kids out. And parents pay top dollar to buy into neighborhoods zoned to “good” public schools that can be as exclusive as private ones. The glaring reality is, whether we are talking about schools or other institutions, it seems as if we have forgotten what “public” really means. The word derives from the Latin word publicus, meaning “of the people. ” This concept  —   that the government belongs to the people and the government should provide for the good of the people  —   was foundational to the world’s nascent democracies. Where once citizens paid taxes to the monarchy in the hope that it would serve the public too, in democracies they paid taxes directly for infrastructure and institutions that benefited society as a whole. The tax dollars of ancient Athenians and Romans built roads and aqueducts, but they also provided free meals to widows whose husbands died in war. “Public” stood not just for how something was financed  —   with the tax dollars of citizens  —   but for a communal ownership of institutions and for a society that privileged the common good over individual advancement. Early on, it was this investment in public institutions that set America apart from other countries. Public hospitals ensured that even the indigent received good medical care  —   health problems for some could turn into epidemics for us all. Public parks gave access to the great outdoors not just to the wealthy who could retreat to their country estates but to the masses in the nation’s cities. Every state invested in public universities. Public schools became widespread in the 1800s, not to provide an advantage for particular individuals but with the understanding that shuffling the wealthy and working class together (though not black Americans and other racial minorities) would create a common sense of citizenship and national identity, that it would tie together the fates of the haves and the   and that doing so benefited the nation. A sense of the public good was a unifying force because it meant that the rich and the poor, the powerful and the meek, shared the spoils  —   as well as the burdens  —   of this messy democracy. Achieving this has never been an easy feat. The tension between individual striving and the common good, between the beliefs that strong government protects and provides for its citizens and that big government leads to tyranny, has always existed in this country. As a result, support for public institutions and expansive government has ebbed and flowed. When Franklin Delano Roosevelt, in response to the Great Depression, ushered through the biggest expansion of federal programs in our nation’s history, he did so because he thought that government regulation was necessary to empower common people against corporations and banks but also that government should provide certain protections for its citizens. Under the New Deal, we got Social Security and unemployment insurance. Federal housing projects  —   public housing  —   meant quality dwellings for the nation’s working people. Federal works projects employed millions of    Americans and brought infrastructure to communities that had not been able to pay for it on their own. At the same time, the New Deal stoked the ire of a   antiregulation minority, who began to push back, though it would take some decades before their views became mainstream. They promoted   principles, deregulation and the privatization of functions normally handled by the government and sought to define all things  —   like the benefits of education  —   strictly in terms of their economic value. Nonetheless, Roosevelt’s government expansion was widely supported, and Americans elected him to an unprecedented four terms as president. But the broad support of public programs and institutions hinged on a narrow definition of who that public was: white Americans. To get his New Deal passed, Roosevelt compromised with white Southerners in Congress, and much of the legislation either explicitly or implicitly discriminated against black citizens, denying them many of its benefits. As the civil rights movement gained ground in the 1950s and 1960s, however, a series of court rulings and new laws ensured that black Americans now had the same legal rights to public schools, libraries, parks and swimming pools as white Americans. But as black Americans became part of the public, white Americans began to pull away. Instead of sharing their public pools with black residents  —   whose tax dollars had also paid for them  —   white Americans founded private clubs (often with public funds) or withdrew behind their fences where they dug their own pools. Public housing was once seen as a community good that drew presidents for photo ops. But after federal housing policies helped white Americans buy their own homes in the suburbs, black Americans, who could not get   mortgages, languished in public housing, which became stigmatized. Where once public transportation showed a city’s forward progress, white communities began to fight its expansion, fearing it would give unwanted people access to their enclaves. And white Americans began to withdraw from public schools or move away from school districts with large numbers of black children once the courts started mandating desegregation. Some communities shuttered public schools altogether rather than allow black children to share publicly funded schools with white children. The very voucher movement that is at the heart of DeVos’s educational ideas was born of white opposition to school desegregation as state and local governments offered white children vouchers to pay for private schools  —   known as segregation academies  —   that sprouted across the South after the Supreme Court struck down school segregation in 1954. “What had been enjoyed as a public thing by white citizens became a place of forced encounter with other people from whom they wanted to be separate,” Bonnie Honig, a professor of political science and modern culture and media at Brown University and author of the forthcoming book “Public Things: Democracy in Disrepair,” told me. “The attractiveness of private schools and other forms of privatization are not just driven by economization but by the desire to control the community with which you interact. ” Even when they fail, the guiding values of public institutions, of the public good, are equality and justice. The guiding value of the free market is profit. The   charters DeVos helped expand have not provided an appreciably better education for Detroit’s children, yet they’ve continued to expand because they are profitable  —   or as Tom Watkins, Michigan’s former education superintendent, said, “In a number of cases, people are making a boatload of money, and the kids aren’t getting educated. ” Democracy works only if those who have the money or the power to opt out of public things choose instead to opt in for the common good. It’s called a social contract, and we’ve seen what happens in cities where the social contract is broken: White residents vote against tax hikes to fund schools where they don’t send their children, parks go untended and libraries shutter because affluent people feel no obligation to help pay for things they don’t need. “The existence of public things  —   to meet each other, to fight about, to pay for together, to enjoy, to complain about  —   this is absolutely indispensable to democratic life,” Honig says. If there is hope for a renewal of our belief in public institutions and a common good, it may reside in the public schools. Nine of 10 children attend one, a rate of participation that few, if any, other public bodies can claim, and schools, as segregated as many are, remain one of the few institutions where Americans of different classes and races mix. The vast multiracial, socioeconomically diverse defense of public schools that DeVos set off may show that we have not yet given up on the ideals of the public  —   and on ourselves.	1
300	BRENTWOOD, N. Y.  —   After five teenagers were found dead in this Long Island town last year, murdered by the members of a transnational gang with ties to El Salvador, a local problem turned into a national flash point, a referendum on illegal immigration. Now, in the wake of President Trump’s broad executive orders on deporting undocumented immigrants, Suffolk County police officials are wrestling with a conundrum facing police departments across the country: how to shut down a violent gang when the immigrants they will need as witnesses and tipsters may be afraid to come forward. “The last thing I want is a fearful community,” the Suffolk County police commissioner, Timothy Sini, said in a recent interview. “Whether it’s fear of criminals or fear of law enforcement. We solve crimes based on people coming to us. It’s that simple. If people think they’re going to get deported every time they speak to a police officer, it’s not helpful. ” Part of the issue is that Mr. Trump wants local police officers to act as immigration agents, threatening to withhold federal funding from those departments that do not cooperate. So Mr. Sini is far from alone in trying to balance public safety with the threat of losing millions of dollars in funding. Last month, the International Association of Chiefs of Police issued a statement saying that it would “strongly oppose any initiative that would mandate that state and local law enforcement agencies play a role in the enforcement of federal immigration law. ” The chiefs urged “clear guidance” on how, or even whether, to make local policy changes. Sanctuary cities, which limit their agencies and local law enforcement officials from assisting in the enforcement of federal immigration laws, are facing a similar question. But the confusion about how Mr. Sini’s department will enforce national policy is clearly provoking more fear among undocumented immigrants in Suffolk County. “In the absence of any clear direction of the police, people assume that whatever we’re getting from the federal level is coming down to the local level,” said Irma Solis, the director of the Suffolk County office of the New York Civil Liberties Union. “People will say, ‘I will think twice, or three times, before I end up reporting something,’” Ms. Solis added. Mr. Sini told Ms. Solis and other advocates at a meeting in January, “If a victim or a witness comes to us, we don’t inquire about their immigration status. ” But still, some are unconvinced. At the Brentwood office of Make the Road New York, an advocacy group that works with undocumented immigrants, members said they were very anxious. “You see this fear that they are going to attack us, the Hispanics, because they have power from higher up, and the sheriff is cooperating,” said Luis, 41, a father of two daughters, who immigrated from El Salvador without authorization 10 years ago. He did not want his sur name to be used because he is afraid for his older daughter’s safety in the high school, he said. That was the same school  —   Brentwood Ross  —   that Kayla Cuevas and her best friend, Nisa Mickens, attended. On Sept. 13, they were killed by members of the gang   the police said, their bodies found by a    near an elementary school. Kayla’s mother, Evelyn Rodriguez, approved of Mr. Trump’s aggressive tactics toward deporting gang members. “I believe everybody should have that American dream, coming here and working hard for your family and doing the right thing,” Ms. Rodriguez, whose parents came to New York from Puerto Rico, said in a recent interview. “I do not accept the ones that are coming over with the criminal record long as ever and doing the crimes here and killing our kids. ” Law enforcement officials say that not every   member is an undocumented immigrant, but that the gang recruits from a base of unaccompanied Central American minors who entered the country illegally. Since Sept. 13, the police in Suffolk County have arrested more than 90   members, with many in federal custody as officials gather evidence to charge them under organized crime law. The gang, also known as La Mara Salvatrucha, was responsible for the killings of 11 people in Suffolk County last year, the police said. It was not clear if the murders would be included in the charges. As part of Mr. Trump’s executive orders, he directed the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency to expand its   crime initiative. Even before the orders, Suffolk County had rejoined a joint gang task force with the F. B. I. and increased its own street patrols last fall. But to Ms. Rodriguez, it is not enough. “I told the Third Precinct, I want you to be pressing on this,” Ms. Rodriguez said, referring to the police precinct that covers Brentwood. “If you see three, four individuals in front of a store, I want you to roll up on them and see ID and if they don’t have ID, then you bring them in. ” Even as Mr. Sini has tried to make the police department more transparent within the community, he does so amid Suffolk County’s tangled history with Latino immigrants. In 1986, at the height of the civil war in El Salvador, the Suffolk County Legislature declared the county a place of sanctuary for refugees fleeing conflict in Central America. But once the population grew from a couple of thousand to almost 7, 000 immigrants, attitudes changed. By 1993, that resolution was reversed. According to census statistics through 2014, 58, 426 Salvadorans live in Suffolk County, and nearly   live in Brentwood. Including immigrants from Mexico, Colombia, Ecuador and the Dominican Republic, Hispanics and Latinos represent 68 percent of the population in Brentwood. Over the years, law enforcement policies toward undocumented immigrants have hardened. In 2006, the Suffolk County sheriff, Vincent DeMarco, invited Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers to station themselves permanently in the county jails. Officers would comply with the enforcement agency’s requests to hold prisoners 48 hours after their scheduled release so that their legal status in the country could be investigated. In  2014, in response to rulings in federal lawsuits against similar policies in other jurisdictions, Mr. DeMarco changed the jail’s detainer policy to require a warrant from a judge in order to detain undocumented immigrants. Then, in December, Mr. DeMarco reversed the policy again, saying he would honor requests from ICE to hold prisoners who had possibly violated immigration law. Mr. DeMarco did so after neighboring Nassau County made a similar change. “To me, that is good public policy for the county, but it’s also good public policy for the country,” Mr. DeMarco said, adding that he considered the change even before Mr. Trump was elected. But how undocumented immigrants land in jail is now the prime concern for advocates in Suffolk County, who worry that traffic stops and routine interactions could accelerate deportations. Many Latino immigrants in Suffolk County already feel as if they are under suspicion from a police force that has, in the past, been less than sympathetic. The community still resents an unsolved 2010 murder of a Salvadoran man. The Police Department is still under Justice Department supervision after the settlement of a 2009 discrimination investigation. Then in 2014, a Suffolk County police sergeant, Scott Greene, was arrested on charges of stealing from Latino drivers during traffic stops. “Maybe the average white guy on the street in Suffolk County has no idea who Sergeant Greene is,” Mr. Sini said. “But ask the average Latino and they know exactly who Sergeant Greene is, and it kills the department. ” “We could do 6, 000 community events and talk to people, but one Sergeant Greene, and we’re back to Square 1,” he said. Mr. Sini, 36, a former federal prosecutor, became the police commissioner in December 2015, after Police Chief James Burke was indicted on charges of covering up the assault of a heroin addict. Ms. Rodriguez, who lost her daughter to gang violence, attributed the rise of gang activity to what she sees as the Brentwood School District’s lackadaisical policies for monitoring students and responding to threats, including those she reported on behalf of Kayla. Ms. Rodriguez has retained a lawyer to sue the school district. But mostly, she wants government officials  —   from Washington to New York  —   to understand the urgency of the situation. “I want them to really acknowledge that there is a problem,” Ms. Rodriguez said, “especially here on Long Island in Brentwood. ”	1
779	 Police are calling this a crime of the unthinkable, something that most people would never imagine doing. On Monday, police were called to a Louisiana Walmart under the suspicion that a customer was shoplifting food. According to the complaint, a Walmart worker radioed security about a suspicious woman in the meat aisle. Security cameras filmed 33-year-old Shaniqua Johnson shoving sausages under her shirt. CCTV footage then shows the woman walking to the bathroom, where she remained for at least 30 minutes.The male security guard says he knocked on the bathroom door several times but the woman did not respond. He then announced he was entering. What he found behind the door of the unlocked stall is something he said will “haunt his dreams forever.” The security guard reports when he entered the stall, Johnson was inappropriately pleasing herself with a Jimmy Dean package of sausage. He said that when he entered “She didn’t even stop. She just stared at me and kept going.”	0
253	New York City police officers in plain clothes shot and killed a man in Brooklyn early on Sunday when he pointed a   pellet gun at them after robbing a bodega, the police said. Investigators recovered a black imitation pistol from the scene of the shooting, which occurred shortly after 12:40 a. m. on Starr Street near Irving Avenue in the Bushwick neighborhood, said Terence A. Monahan, the chief of patrol. The police officers involved were not identified. The man, whom officials identified as Sergio Reyes, 18, had used the pellet gun to rob the Garden Deli and Grill at 185 Starr Street, the police said. Officials released a surveillance video image of a man  —   dressed in a dark hooded sweatshirt and   pants with a mask covering part of his face  —   pointing the gun at a bodega clerk. The clerk, Mohamed Ali, said Mr. Reyes had entered the bodega and broken a   of beer on the floor. He then grabbed two more beers from the cooler and brought them to the counter, where he pulled out a gun and put it in Mr. Ali’s face, Mr. Ali said. “He said, ‘Bag it up,’” Mr. Ali recalled. “‘Bag it up, or I’m going to kill you. And shut the camera off. ’” Mr. Ali called 911 and a few minutes later heard gunshots down the block. Chief Monahan said the police responded to Mr. Ali’s 911 call around 12:40 a. m. A sergeant and two officers from an   unit in the 83rd Precinct went to the bodega, he said. As they talked to witnesses, the officers spotted Mr. Reyes, who was walking west on Starr Street, alongside Maria Hernandez Park. Chief Monahan said the officers gave Mr. Reyes verbal commands and confronted him in front of 169 Starr Street. “The suspect had a black firearm in his hand and raised it toward the officers,” Chief Monahan said. “The officers fired at the suspect and struck him multiple times. ” Jovan, 22, who lives on Starr Street and did not want his last name used out of concern for his safety, said he heard at least six gunshots and saw a chaotic scene unfold outside his window: people running, a van racing backward along the street  —   he said he thought it might have been an undercover police vehicle  —   and, soon after, a   officer with his gun drawn and briefly pointed at bystanders. Jovan said his first thought was that a gang confrontation had just erupted. He said he remained indoors for fear of being caught in crossfire. Outside, Mr. Reyes had been wounded in the torso, and he was pronounced dead at Woodhull Medical and Mental Health Center, the police said. The three officers involved in the shooting were not hurt. The police said on Sunday evening that they were investigating the shooting and the robbery that preceded it. Mr. Reyes lived a few blocks from the bodega, in a small,   apartment building on Wilson Avenue. On Sunday evening, Mr. Reyes’s father, Antonio Tlapanco, 48, wept as he stood next to a memorial to his slain son: a framed photograph of Mr. Reyes placed on a kitchen table alongside two floral bouquets in vases, candles and an illustration of the Madonna. Mr. Tlapanco, speaking through a Spanish interpreter, said that his son had never been in trouble with the police and that he never carried firearms or weapons of any kind. “I would have known,” said Mr. Tlapanco, who said he regularly checked the contents of all of his children’s backpacks. “The truth is, I don’t know where that came from,” Mr. Tlapanco said of the black pellet gun. “I never saw it around the house. If I would have seen something like that, I would have taken it away from him. ” Mr. Tlapanco said he had questions about the circumstances surrounding his son’s death and the Police Department’s account of it. He showed a photograph that he took at the hospital of bruising on his son’s neck. Mr. Reyes was one of six children, ages 15 to 23, born in the United States to Mr. Tlapanco and his wife, who are immigrants from Mexico. Mr. Tlapanco said Mr. Reyes was a student at Leadership  Public Service High School in Lower Manhattan and was studying to become a social worker. For hours on Sunday, police tape blocked off Starr Street from Irving Avenue to Knickerbocker Avenue, and no one was allowed in Maria Hernandez Park. The park is bordered by small grocers and restaurants, a Pentecostal church, a public school and rows of   apartment buildings. Signs of the neighborhood’s gentrification are evident, including a coffee shop with a youthful clientele directly across Irving Avenue from the scene of the shooting. Noah LePage, 21, said that he had lived on the Suydam Street side of the park since the summer and had seen the police conduct a few drug busts along Starr Street. “We see them a few times in their black vans and everything, but nothing like this,” he said.	1
423	MILAN  —   Didn’t Isabelle Huppert look great? And Viola Davis? What about that peachy color on Nicole Kidman? Such were the whispers going around at the Giorgio Armani show on Monday, the morning after the night before  —   which is to say, in the bleachers of the Armani Theater just a few hours after Mr. Armani had dressed those   nominees for what is arguably the biggest fashion show of them all, the Academy Awards. Perhaps acknowledging that it’s almost impossible for the runway to compete with the red carpet these days  —   no one, after all, understands the power of Hollywood, and how it can be harnessed for fashion, better than Mr. Armani  —   the designer kept the gowns in Milan to a minimum (one final showstopper in a rainbow of swirling crystals, a black velvet column twinkling stars) and instead concentrated on a multiplicity of fluid trousers and natty jackets in jewel tones and tactile fabrications. Plus a somewhat   new idea: skinny pants with an insert of pleated silk chiffon attached in the front or back in a contrasting color to create a  . A skant? A pirt? It was one way to startle people away from the   slide shows on their cellphones and into attention. In one of the more unfortunate coincidences of timing, the Milan women’s wear season draws to a close in the long shadow of the Oscars. It tends to make for a pretty anticlimactic ending. Everyone is focused on the clothes over there, when they are supposed to be focused over here. What’s a designer to do? Take a cue from the movies, apparently. Arthur Arbesser, for one, part of the fresh crop of names in the city, started with Wim Wenders’s 1987 film “Wings of Desire,” set in the Berlin circus scene, and then embraced  —   well, not gold, but bronze, in the form of gleaming vinyl, as well as a kaleidoscopic   mix in knits and cotton shirting, vinyl and latex. The multiple stripes and squares tumbled together in a not entirely successful mix of clownish proportions. Stella Jean, meanwhile, another   also went Eastern bloc, though even more literally, upping the narrative by weaving a tale of the Cold War and Siberia (and Syria, too) full of military memorabilia and folkloric fantasy. Think   with velvet epaulets, gold fringe and rows of decorative medals paired with skirts depicting village scenes in winter, babushka headgear and leopard print,   patchworks of silk and brocade. Less dramatic, however, was Salvatore Ferragamo, where Fulvio Rigoni, making his official debut as design director for women’s wear, beat a strategic retreat toward the long, lean and mostly neutral. Dresses were sleeveless and patched together from abstracted animal prints, sometimes with a trompe l’oeil cape of a sweater hanging off the back, as if the model had just shrugged out of her cardigan outerwear came complete with curving double portrait collars (including on a long sleeveless puffer coat, one of the weirder ideas) and trousers were   . Paired with Paul Andrew’s towering   stacked heels on   bootees, the collection looked like the beginning of an idea that had not yet burst into bloom. For posies, as well as leopard print, ruched sheaths, velvet trouser suits, robot appliqués,   chubbies (don’t be a cuddly puma, wear one instead!) elaborately embroidered denim,       prints, puppy prints, tuxes of all types, corsetry, and a gold Lurex crocheted minidress with hearts all over, there was Dolce  Gabbana. Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana had what seemed like an   of their own, but instead of golden statuettes, there were golden tiaras. On almost everyone. I know this, not because I was at the show (The New York Times, as we have pointed out before, is not invited to attend the collection, for reasons rooted in history that began long before I arrived at the newspaper) but because it became a social media sensation thanks to the digital reach of the millennials, children of and influencers who walked in the show (alongside a few models and many very good customers)  —   a combined total of approximately 65 million followers on Instagram, according to the website fashionunfiltered. com. As a result, I could watch it. So I did! Given the emphasis the brand has placed on its relationship with the digital generation over the last year or so, it seemed the appropriate thing to do. The livestream (and related coverage) wasn’t quite as long as a feature, but almost. Seemingly pitched as a celebration of family  —   the family the brand has made, and literal family, as relatives of all generations walked  —   it came complete with   celebrity front row (see: Rene Russo, Christie Brinkley, Jamie Foxx, Pamela Anderson) attracted by the fact their children were strutting in the show. Between that and the frenzy generated by a   from the teen idol Austin Mahone (10 million Instagram followers) no one seemed to pay much attention to the clothes. Though that could also be because  —   save, perhaps, for the Justin Bieber    —   they looked like they had come straight from the Dolce archive of greatest hits. There’s something for everyone inside. But then, the collection was almost beside the point. Which could be summed up fairly simply: If you can’t beat ’em, and don’t want to join ’em, go viral on ’em. Now to Paris.	1

724	 An evening of body shots and drunken adults turned into a violent riot over the weekend after several men lined up to receive ‘vodka butt shots’ from 28-year-old Brittany Sullivan. According to patrons at Timber Creek Bar in St. Louis, Missouri, it is not uncommon for women to crawl on the bar and offer body shots to men. However, it was the first time the shots had ever been delivered in this way. “Yeah, this chick was real drunk. She went over to the corner with a funnel, a bottle of Kettle One and her girlfriend, poured the vodka in the back door and stuck a straw in there,” said Tim Wolfson who was at the bar that evening. “She let loose a good one and clear liquid flew out. So several of the drunk dudes in there went for it. But it was the last guy that got more than he bargained for. It was the most disgusting thing I had ever seen in my entire life. Especially the corn, when I saw that I lost it.”	0

75	PHNOM PENH, Cambodia  —   The embattled leader of Cambodia’s main opposition party abruptly quit on Saturday in the face of increasing government pressure, ceding a political stage he had occupied for more than two decades. The resignation of the leader, Sam Rainsy, came after the government began a series of moves that would allow it to dissolve the Cambodia National Rescue Party he led, in advance of crucial local elections set for June. The opposition has also been hit with a barrage of lawsuits and leaked telephone conversations between leading figures and women purported to be their mistresses. It was unclear whether Mr. Sam Rainsy, 67, was leaving politics for good or was planning to work quietly behind the scenes. Either way, his exit seemed to represent the end of an era. As the head of three   political parties since 1995, he had been a thorn in the side of the country’s   prime minister, Hun Sen, for more than 20 years. In an interview on Sunday from Paris, where he has lived in exile since November 2015, Mr. Sam Rainsy, a   former banker, said he had quit as a “  defensive move” to save his political party. This month, Mr. Hun Sen proposed a measure that could dissolve any party led by someone convicted of a crime, which Mr. Sam Rainsy has been many times, because of an abundance of criminal defamation suits filed against him by government officials, government allies and the prime minister himself. “This guy is crazy,” Mr. Sam Rainsy said of Mr. Hun Sen. “He can do anything he wants without consideration for legal, judicial principles, so I have to defend my party and tell Hun Sen and tell the Cambodian people and tell the whole world that Hun Sen no longer has any grounds to dissolve the C. N. R. P. on the basis that his kangaroo court has made me a convict. ” He was vague about his future. “In politics, there are always ups and downs,” he said. “Things can change. ” Ou Virak, the chairman of the Future Forum, a public policy research group in Phnom Penh, the capital, said the departure of Mr. Sam Rainsy was a blow for Cambodia’s fledgling democracy. “Leaving in this kind of situation, when the party is under pressure, is not ideal or democratic,” he said. “It highlights the nature of Cambodian politics for the past 20 or so years. Politics is not created by competition and ideas, but personalities and maneuvering to get what people want. ” Mr. Sam Rainsy was one of those personalities. Despite his weaknesses, including a tendency to flee the country in the face of trouble, he is still, for many, the most enduring symbol of opposition to Mr. Hun Sen. The prime minister, a former Khmer Rouge fighter, has held power since 1985 and maintains close control over most of the country’s institutions. “Rainsy is a character with a lot of flaws, but it has to be recognized that he has maintained this position of opposition for nearly a ” said Sebastian Strangio, the author of “Hun Sen’s Cambodia. ” “At any time, he could have sold out to the C. P. P. and become a rich man,” he said, referring to the Cambodian People’s Party, led by Mr. Hun Sen. Mr. Sam Rainsy, while clearly irritating the prime minister, proved useful over the years by presenting an internationally visible opposition figure to run in elections, which Mr. Hun Sen always won, Mr. Strangio added. But Mr. Sam Rainsy began to pose a more existential threat to Mr. Hun Sen’s political survival when he formed a partnership with another government critic, Kem Sokha, in 2012. Their new political party nearly won the 2013 national election, emboldening them and stunning the C. P. P. Mr. Hun Sen and Mr. Sam Rainsy came to a brief rapprochement in 2014 and 2015, with the opposition leader extracting some important political concessions from Mr. Hun Sen, including equal representation on the National Election Committee and a television broadcasting license. But a few months later, the friendly feelings dissolved, and many of the concessions were rescinded. It has been hard to keep up with the number of lawsuits filed against Mr. Sam Rainsy and other opposition figures over the last 18 months, many involving allegations of criminal defamation against government officials. Salacious telephone conversations involving Mr. Kem Sokha and other opposition lawmakers have also been leaked online and discussed widely in   news media. The most recent recording, released a week ago, involved a man who sounded like Mr. Sam Rainsy bantering with a waitress about her eating and bathing habits. Mr. Sam Rainsy’s moral authority was also being eroded from within his party. While he fled the country in November 2015 to avoid jail time, Mr. Kem Sokha made a point of staying after being charged with crimes related to a suspected affair. Eventually, the government pardoned him. Mr. Kem Sokha is set to become the acting opposition leader. In a statement on Sunday, he called Mr. Sam Rainsy’s decision honorable and said it had been made in discussion with the party’s leadership. Phay Siphan, a government spokesman, said the lawsuits against opposition figures were private matters, and he accused Mr. Sam Rainsy of trying to generate publicity with a dramatic exit. “He is an opportunist,” Mr. Phay Siphan said. “Tell me, so far, in the last 20 years, what has he done for Cambodia except move the people to go on strike and have demonstrations?” Mr. Phay Siphan also criticized the United States representatives Alan Lowenthal and Steve Chabot, members of a new congressional caucus on Cambodia, for writing to Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson on Thursday about the need to promote free and fair elections in Cambodia. Mr. Phay Siphan called the representatives “blind” and “ignorant,” and he suggested that Mr. Sam Rainsy was taking cues from them. Mr. Sam Rainsy countered that all he wanted was for his party to survive long enough to run in the elections, with or without him. “It is Hun Sen who sees me behind any initiative to defend democracy,” he said, “but I think Cambodia has many sons, many daughters, who are willing to defend democracy. ”	1

331	Forget the images of men in hard hats standing before factory gates, of men with   faces, of men perched high above New York City on steel beams. The emerging face of the American working class is a Hispanic woman who has never set foot on a factory floor. That’s not the kind of work much of the working class does anymore. Instead of making things, they are more often paid to serve people: to care for someone else’s children or someone else’s parents to clean another family’s home. The decline of the old working class has meant both an economic triumph for the nation and a personal tribulation for many of the workers. Technological progress has made American farms and factories more productive than ever, creating great wealth and cutting the cost of food and most other products. But the work no longer requires large numbers of workers. In 1900, factories and farms employed 60 percent of the work force. By 1950, a   later, those two sectors employed 36 percent. In 2014, they employed less than 10 percent. For more than a century, since the trend was first documented, people have been prophesying a dire future in which the working class would no longer work. In 1964, a group of prominent liberals wrote President Johnson to warn of a “cybernation revolution” inexorably creating “a permanent impoverished and jobless class established in the midst of potential abundance. ” Machines have taken the jobs of millions of Americans, and there is every indication that the trend will continue. In October, Budweiser successfully tested a   truck by delivering beer more than 120 miles to a warehouse in Colorado. In December, Amazon opened a small convenience store near its Seattle headquarters that has no cashiers. Customers  —   for now, Amazon employees only  —   are billed automatically as they leave the store. In January, Bank of America opened branches in Denver and Minneapolis that are staffed by a lone employee, A. T. M.s and video terminals. And Americans are making a growing share of purchases online: about 8. 4 percent of retail sales in 2016. These changes are driven by consumer preferences, not just by corporate   imperatives. People like shopping in bed in the middle of the night. People like that computers make fewer mistakes. And people grow accustomed to computers. A few years ago, I watched a woman walk up to a bank teller and ask where she could find an A. T. M. The teller asked if she could help. No, the woman said, she just needed to withdraw some money. But the forecasters were wrong in the most important respect. Workers continue to find work, but now the jobs are in service. Taking care of aging baby boomers, in particular, has become by far the largest driver of job growth in the American economy. Among the occupations the Bureau of Labor Statistics expects to grow most rapidly over the next decade:   assistants, home health aides,   assistants, nurse practitioners, physical therapists,   aides, physician assistants. . .. You get the idea. Nine of the 12   fields are different ways of saying “nurse. ” In 1950, service work made up about 40 percent of   labor in the United States. By 2005, that share had climbed to 56 percent, according to data from a 2013 analysis by the economists David Autor at M. I. T. and David Dorn at the University of Zurich. The available evidence, Autor said, suggests that this trend has continued “very rapidly” over the last decade, increasing the share of American workers who work in the service industries. The rise of   employment reflects the fact that Americans on average have more money to spend and that we are spending relatively less of that money on physical goods, because those goods have become cheaper. It took 10. 5 hours of work at average wages to buy a bicycle in 1979 it took just four hours in 2015. Most Americans don’t want a second and third bicycle, so that leaves more money for other purposes. And increasingly, the money is spent on services: help around the home, entertainment and vacations and, most of all, education and health care. These jobs are difficult to mechanize or to perform with greater efficiency. Convalescents cannot be trained to eat more quickly. A phlebotomist cannot draw blood from two arms at once. Robots, as yet, cannot change diapers. Moreover, consumers may have an emotional investment in seeing this caring work performed by people rather than machines. They may be willing to pay for a personal touch. Another limitation on our ability to program computers to do the work of people is summarized by the observation of the Hungarian scientist Michael Polanyi that “we can know more than we can tell. ” Consider the work of a security guard, who is basically tasked with sounding the alarm if something doesn’t seem right. Technology improves security, but it is not easy to write a formula approximating intuition. The Cassandras, however, were right to warn about poverty in the midst of abundance.   providers  —   “servants,” as they once were called  —   tend to be poorly paid. There is little job security the benefits are meager the work is physically demanding and emotionally draining. It is not particularly surprising that women and immigrants have been more likely to take these jobs than   men. For many of the caretaking service jobs, less than 10 percent of the work force is male. The wages of service work increasingly determine the welfare of the American working class and, to a substantial degree, the broader economy. But politicians have paid little attention. That’s partly because Americans continue to view service work as a way station, not a way of life. Teenagers get their first job at McDonald’s mothers dip back into the work force as receptionists seniors make a little extra money as Walmart greeters. The reality is that these are the kinds of jobs millions of Americans hold for their entire working lives. And increasingly, these are the jobs their children will perform, too.  —  Binyamin Appelbaum  Santa Clara, Calif. • The Home Health Aide By Elise Craig Two major events in Ofelia Bersabe’s life persuaded her to become a home health aide. In 2008, the Bay Area electronics company where she worked for 21 years as a   supervisor let her go in a mass layoff. And that same year, her mother, whom she followed to the United States from the Philippines nearly two decades earlier, died. “When she passed away in my arms, I felt that I hadn’t given her the full attention I wanted to,” Bersabe said. “I promised myself that I would concentrate on taking care of women, especially seniors. In that way, I feel like I’m still taking care of her. ” Nine years later, at age 69, Bersabe is among nearly a million Americans who work as home health aides, a field that is expected to grow 38 percent by 2024, faster than most other occupations, thanks in large part to the aging   population. Already a senior herself, Bersabe works 65 hours a week caring for two elderly clients with dementia. She spends five   and   night shifts in her clients’ homes, providing companionship, reminders to take medicine and light housekeeping for one client, and everything from bathing and dressing to diaper changing for the other. Having two jobs is partly a necessity and partly a hedge should one of her clients die, she can still rely on income from the other. She also needs the money. Because she is a member of the Service Employees International Union Local 2015, the agencies that Bersabe works for pay her $16. 13 and $11 an hour. California’s current minimum wage is $10. 50, but the living wage for someone like Bersabe is $11. 29. Bersabe is grateful for the money and has no complaints about her wages, but she acknowledges that making a living in the Bay Area’s technology bubble is tough. She lost her house after the 2008 layoff, and she and her husband, who works nights as a security guard, now share a   apartment rental behind Levi’s Stadium, where the 49ers play, with two other elderly couples. The gratitude Bersabe’s clients show her  —   one kisses her when she arrives  —   is incredibly fulfilling, she said, but the work is hard. Dementia patients can be very unpredictable. “I have a very tame cat, and when they start to have  ”  —   the   confusion that can be a symptom of dementia  —   “I have a wild tiger,” she said. “But it’s not the person herself, it’s the sickness. ” Once, when a client began to get agitated and yell at Bersabe, she sneaked around to the front door and rang the doorbell. The client welcomed Bersabe as an old friend that she hadn’t seen in a long time. Bersabe expects to work through her 70s and 80s and maybe even into her 90s. “I’ll work as long as I can stand on my own two legs,” she said. “As long as I can drive and walk and God permits me, I’ll enjoy the job I love. ” Bersabe has no intention of being a burden to her three children, who have families of their own and are scattered from Kentucky to the Philippines. “Honestly, I am thinking, when the time comes, who is going to take care of me?” she said. “I don’t want to bother my kids. I want them to see me as a kicking woman, like I was before. ” Elise Craig is a freelance writer and editor based in San Francisco. Brooklyn • The Hair Braider By Jazmine Hughes On a recent visit to Jennifer’s Beauty World, in Flatbush, Brooklyn, Sonia Ufot started by detangling my tightly coiled hair and   it   then she parted a small section into an individual plait, wrapped a section of filler hair around the root and braided it straight down for 16 inches. She repeated this step around 80 more times, over the course of about six hours, all that time spent either standing or hunched over on a high stool. “It takes time and patience for you to be able to stand on your feet for hours to braid somebody’s hair,” she said, “so you really have to love doing it. ” Ufot, 38, has known how to braid since she was 15 she picked up the skill in Warri, Nigeria, where she was born. A family friend owned a braiding shop, and she visited every day, watching the women do their work and, eventually, persuading them to let her practice on their customers’ heads. She majored in economics at Delta State University in Nigeria, but while she was at school, she found out she had thyroid cancer and eventually moved to the United States for treatment. She started braiding hair for the money and never returned to economics. “There’s more money doing hair,” she told me. And because she’s in such high demand, Ufot can work 12 to 15 hour days, sometimes seven days a week, depending on appointments. She charges between $100 to $250 for each style, depending on its intricacy. She hasn’t gone on vacation in five years. Unlike most people trained in cosmetology, braiders, many of whom are immigrants, don’t use chemicals, sharp objects or heat just a comb, oil, water and their hands. Individual states legislate the requirements for becoming a licensed hair braider in several, braiders  —   even those with a   knowledge of braiding  —   are required to complete more than 2, 000 hours of training at cosmetology schools, which can cost tens of thousands of dollars and whose classes have almost nothing to do with styling black women’s hair. Many cosmetology schools don’t even offer braiding instruction. In 2016, Iowa ended its   requirement for hair braiders, allowing them instead to pass basic    exams with the state Nebraska, too, recently ended its laborious stipulation of 2, 100 hours of cosmetology training for natural hair braiders. In New York, braiders are required to obtain a   license, which allows the stylists to perform the   techniques of styling black hair  —   for example, shampooing hair, applying extensions, making dreadlocks, braiding  —   and not much else. It costs about $70 and mandates schooling, which costs more. But many braiders operate without licenses. Ufot wants to go to cosmetology school her goal is to enroll by year’s end, if she can get enough financial aid. She figures it will cost her about $15, 000, so she’ll continue braiding and attend night classes as long she can get someone to look after her    daughter. She told me that she wants to learn how to do all types of hair  —   dyeing, perms  —   and dreams of owning her own shop. “I want to get my cosmetology license so I’m able to do all of the things,” she told me, laughing. “I want to be able to cut white people’s hair!” Jazmine Hughes is an associate editor for the magazine. Cicero, Ill. • The   Worker By Ben Austen Adriana Alvarez was leaving her McDonald’s at the end of a daylong shift in 2014 when a man stopped her in the parking lot. She’d noticed him inside, buying coffee, and now he asked if she’d heard about the Fight for $15. Laughing, she said $15 an hour for   work sounded crazy. She was racing to pick up her son Manny from day care, but she talked with the guy later that evening. She told him that she earned $8. 50 an hour, just 25 cents above the Illinois minimum wage. She’d been at the same McDonald’s in Cicero, a largely Latino town west of Chicago, for about four years. In all that time, she had one raise: 10 cents. The man explained that she’d been cheated even out of her low pay: Workers at restaurants had been required, illegally, to punch out before tallying up their registers or breaking down   boxes. “I think about it now,” Alvarez says. “God, I was stupid. ” A few weeks after meeting the organizer, Alvarez said, she and her   handed in a petition demanding that the store manager show them more respect in front of customers. Not only did the yelling stop, she said, but they soon received a raise of as much as 75 cents. “Pushing works,” Alvarez says she learned. In March 2014, she joined her first rally, a multicity coordinated Fight for $15 day of action. Alvarez is now 24 and still works at the same McDonald’s. Nationally, jobs in retail and food services outnumber those in manufacturing by more than two to one. The country’s largest private employers include Walmart, McDonald’s, Kroger and the conglomeration of KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell. These chains are no longer places just for teenagers to work part time: The average age of a   employee has climbed to 29 like Alvarez, a third of them have spent some time in college. Fight for $15 doesn’t operate like a traditional union: There are no contracts with employers, and Alvarez and others pay no dues. The Service Employees International Union has been its primary source of funding from its inception in New York City, in 2012. Yet Fight for $15 organizers take credit for winning wage increases for 22 million workers in America. Although the federal minimum wage of $7. 25 hasn’t budged since 2009, numerous cities and states since 2012 have raised their base pay to $12, $13 and even $15 an hour. Under President Trump, the effort is sure to face additional hurdles. But Fight for $15 helped lead the campaign to derail Trump’s first pick for labor secretary, Andrew Puzder, organizing workers from his   chains to march on their stores and to share their stories of wage theft. Low pay is an issue that crosses party lines: Two of every five U. S. workers earn less than $15 an hour. Today Alvarez makes $11 an hour at McDonald’s. She has never been put on the schedule for a full   week she receives no benefits, health coverage or overtime. Yet the raise has allowed her to replace the moldering floorboards in her basement apartment. And Alvarez has been transformed in other ways by the labor fight. She has emerged as one of its spokeswomen, and the job has taken on a new significance. “When people say we should go back to school, I say the adjunct professors who joined us went to school,” Alvarez said. “How come they’re not doing better? I’m not just serving customers. I’m also serving these innocent ladies”  —   her    —   “who might not be conscious of their rights. I’m like their protector. ” Ben Austen is working on a book about Chicago’s     complex. 4. Stuart Culver Brooklyn Park, Minn. • The Delivery Driver By Jaime Lowe Stuart Culver starts his overnight shift for O’Reilly Auto Parts at 7 p. m. and finishes about nine hours later. A relay driver, he exchanges freight  —   mufflers, batteries, drums of   fluid  —   with another driver in La Crosse, Wis. and then makes deliveries to five stores on his route. The road has changed over the two decades that he has been driving trucks. “In today’s day and age, it’s really stressful,” he says. “You’re a lot more likely to be struck because of other drivers using their cellphone. ” The regulatory landscape has changed, too. Every year, for example, Culver has to undergo a Department of Transportation physical, because he has sleep apnea. In recent years, online giants like Amazon have pushed for   delivery times, sometimes delivering orders on the same day. As consumers increase their online shopping  —   total retail sales in the United States increased only 2. 9 percent last year, but online sales rose 15. 1 percent  —   distribution networks have adapted by integrating more and more consumer destinations into their systems. Mark Merz, a spokesman for O’Reilly, attributes part of the company’s success to “having inventory immediately available when a customer needs those parts. ” Though O’Reilly extended its reach to 4, 829 stores in 47 states last year and revenue surpassed $8. 5 billion, that growth hasn’t led to an expansion of its work force or changed the nature of its jobs. “We’ve been   for over six months,” Culver says. “Guys are doing extra work and taking on extra stores for their routes. ” Culver, who belongs to the Teamsters Local 120, says he is not paid by the amount of time it takes him to complete his deliveries but according to the route driven, which varies from year to year. Culver says he made roughly $53, 000 last year, earning almost $23 an hour. “Our wages haven’t really gone up in the same way that other jobs’ wages have gone up,” he says. “I have to go to special school to get my license, and how we’re treated and looked at hasn’t really changed in 20 years. ” Culver, who is 56, doesn’t expect that technology will eliminate work like his. “I don’t see how automatic truck drivers are going to work,” he says. “There are so many variables. ” O’Reilly still needs people to operate the electric pallet jacks and hydraulic liftgates at the rear of their delivery trucks, still relies on backs and arms to unload and inspect orders. Despite the toll the work has taken on Culver  —   two operations to fuse vertebrae in his neck and a   operation  —   he says he likes the job. “I’m happy doing this, I enjoy what I do,” he says. “I hope I can make it to 65. ” Jaime Lowe is a freelance writer and a frequent contributor to the magazine. Las Vegas • The   Rep By Eric Steuer When Sandi Dolan moved to Las Vegas in 2014, to escape the cold Colorado winters, she’d been working primarily as a   representative for more than a decade in the insurance industry. Dolan is remarkably upbeat, and she says she genuinely enjoys helping strangers solve problems. But she said that day after day of calls about accidents and claims made for a pretty depressing gig. “No one ever wants to talk to their insurance company,” she said. “It’s never a good phone call. ” Not long after landing in Las Vegas, Dolan started looking for a job. She found a   opening with Zappos, the online    retailer. “I actually didn’t know anything about the company,” she said. “But after I was hired, I started talking to locals, and people were like: ‘You have no idea, do you? We all tried to get in there. ’’u2009” Zappos has more than 500 people on its   team, about a third of the company’s total staff. Most employees work together in the company’s headquarters, a   building downtown that used to be Las Vegas’s city hall. Employees like Dolan, who work the phones, start at $14 an hour, about a dollar less than the median wage earned by the more than 2. 5 million Americans who work as   representatives. But Dolan, who makes slightly more than that, points out that, unlike at many other companies, most Zappos workers are   employees who receive benefits like health insurance and retirement plans. At Zappos, employees are encouraged to interact with   throughout the business and eat together on campus. The company frequently hosts events, ranging from product demonstrations to scavenger hunts, which are open to all employees. Dolan said this is one thing that makes her current work so much better than previous jobs. “I’ve been in places where I wasn’t even allowed to take a break with someone if they were a different pay grade than I was,” she said. Another difference from Dolan’s previous   jobs is that Zappos reps aren’t limited in the amount of time they are allowed to spend on each conversation. “At other jobs, I’d be stressed because I’d have to resolve each call in about five minutes in order to make my numbers,” Dolan said. She knows she could be making more money somewhere else, but she wouldn’t enjoy her day as much. “I figured I’d do this for six months just to get something local on my résumé so I could look for something else,” she said. “But I haven’t looked for a job since I stepped foot in here. I don’t plan on it. ” Eric Steuer is a contributing writer for Wired based in San Francisco. Columbus, Ohio • The Meat Cutter By Abe Streep Every day at 2 p. m. Ruhatijuru Sebatutsi, a Congolese refugee, rides a bus from outside Columbus, Ohio, where he lives with his wife and eight children, with 10 of his colleagues. The bus travels 40 miles southwest to Washington Court House, population about 14, 000, and drops its passengers near a plant owned by the SugarCreek Packing Company, which produces pork and poultry products like bacon bits and sausage patties. Just before 4, Sebatutsi, 40, changes into the uniform of a meat cutter: cap, gloves and scrubs. Then he takes his place in a line of men and women from Myanmar, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Bhutan and rural Ohio. Sebatutsi fled war in Congo as a teenager and spent most of his life in Rwanda’s sprawling Gihembe refugee camp before being relocated to Ohio in 2015. Once the shift starts, he pushes meat through cutting machines. “You push again and again,” he told me through a translator. “It doesn’t require a lot of knowledge. ” There are three breaks per   shift: 15 minutes early on, a   meal break, then 10 minutes toward the end. At 1 a. m. he takes the bus home. When he arrives, his wife and children are sleeping. He works seven days a week, making $11. 50 an hour, time and a half on Saturdays and double on Sundays. “I am so lucky,” he said. Central Ohio is particularly welcoming to refugees, having resettled more than 17, 000 since 1983. In November 2016, the region became a flash point for those opposed to resettlement when a   Ohio State University student was killed by police after attacking pedestrians. Still, in early February, the Columbus mayor, Andrew Ginther, signed an executive order supporting the resettlement of refugees. His reasons were economic as well as altruistic. Nearly 12 percent of Columbus is  . According to a recent study from the New American Economy, a nonprofit    group,   immigrants pay $1. 2 billion a year in taxes and have an annual spending power of $3. 2 billion. They work as doctors and engineers, open small businesses employing thousands, perform manual labor in warehouses and frequently do the jobs that many other Americans will not, like meatpacking. SugarCreek is one of many meatpacking businesses nationwide that have turned to refugees. Last spring, the company approached Community Refugee and Immigration Services (CRIS) a Columbus   resettlement agency. “They needed people,” said CRIS’s Marcus Gorman, who arranges employment for the newly resettled. “They had a lot of opportunities for   workers, and they were accustomed to working with folks that spoke little to no English. ” Now, Gorman said, about 65 of CRIS’s clients work at SugarCreek. Since Sebatutsi started last November, he has opted to work every day, which he said is the best part of the job. “There’s a lot of overtime, and you can make money. ” But, he added, “that’s also the worst thing. ” He is no longer able to join his family at church. All that pushing, slicing and packaging is repetitive, but it’s far better than life in Gihembe. “The kids can ask you for something, you cannot provide,” he said. “But here you work, you take care of your problems, you do something for yourself. ” Abe Streep is a contributing editor for Outside and a contributing writer for The California Sunday Magazine. Dalton, Ga. • The Carpet Whisperer By Lizzie O’Leary The warehouse where Guadalupe Guido works is so bright inside that it feels like noon no matter the time of day. Huge metal racks hold row after row of carpet that will be trucked from this plant in Dalton, Ga. all over the United States. Dalton calls itself the Carpet Capital of the World, and everyone in Guido’s family  —   her mother, father, sister and herself  —   work for one of Dalton’s carpet companies. Guido, who is 23 and goes by Lupe, has been working at Engineered Floors for almost two years. She has risen quickly, starting on yarn machines, before driving a Hyster forklift, working as a production clerk and now serving as a tufting scheduler. She creates orders, dictating the type of yarn to use and how much footage of carpet each job will need. “Without this person,” she said of her role, “there really is no show. ” In the political sphere, manufacturing work is often associated with men, and specifically white men. But women have always worked in carpets in Dalton and at Engineered Floors. And Dalton is about 50 percent Latino, which is reflected in the work force here. Many people in the city came from Mexico in the 1970s and ’80s to work in the industry, including Guido’s parents, Jose and Martina. Lupe Guido was born in Dalton and dreamed initially of becoming a lawyer. “I talk a lot,” she said with a laugh. But at 18, she wanted independence and her own money and went to work at Mohawk Industries, one of the largest carpet companies in the city, where her mother still works. It was not what her parents had in mind. “When I was growing up, it was always: ‘Go to school, go to school,’’u2009” she said. “’u2009‘You don’t want to be working how I’m working. ’’u2009” But the carpet industry, like most of American manufacturing, has undergone radical changes. The hardest and most dangerous jobs are now performed by machines that are mostly run by computers, and those computers are watched over by people like Guido. Engineered Floors is new in comparison to Mohawk or Shaw Industries, the two companies that have dominated Dalton for decades. But Guido has been able to move up quickly. She earns $15. 50 an hour, up from $11 an hour when she started in 2015. At the end of each year, she gets a $500 bonus. Guido said she would like to stay at Engineered Floors if she can. To do so requires vigilantly managing her time so that she can move up. She’s awake at 6 a. m. clocks into her job at 7 and works a   shift until 5 p. m. After dinner with her fiancé, who also works in the carpet industry, Guido spends her nights studying for a bachelor’s degree in   management at Georgia Northwestern Technical College. One day, she wants to be a department manager or a plant manager. “The way I’ve been growing and growing,” she said, “I don’t want for that to stop. ” Lizzie O’Leary is the host of the radio program “Marketplace Weekend. ” More reporting by O’Leary and the producer Eliza Mills about the carpet industry in Dalton, Ga. is on Marketplace Weekend. Las Vegas • The Hotel Cleaner By Amanda Fortini Most mornings, Wendy Almada  —   a   attendant, or G. R. A. at the Aria Resort and Casino on the Las Vegas Strip  —   puts on a pair of latex gloves and tackles the bathroom first. “I don’t like to do beds,” she said. “I like to clean bathrooms. ” Next she yanks off the sheets, bags them and makes up the bed. She dusts, vacuums, empties the garbage. If a light bulb is out or the carpet needs to be shampooed, she puts in a work order. She scans the room for any last detail that she might have overlooked, then clocks out and moves on to the next one. She cleans 13 rooms a day, with suites counting as two or three. Sometimes the job is that straightforward, but often she opens the door to find what all G. R. A.s dread: a “trashed” room. “They eat and they leave all the trash everywhere: cans, food,” she said, gesturing with her hands. She was seated at a folding table in a trailer parked in the lot of the Las Vegas Culinary Workers Union. “Especially the bachelor party. Oh, my God, those are bad. ” Because she is a member of the union, the job pays her $17. 65 an hour. The Culinary Workers Union Local 226, chartered in 1935, is the largest union in Nevada, representing 57, 000 men and women from 167 countries (its membership is 56 percent Latino and 81 percent people of color) among them cooks, bartenders, cocktail servers, porters, bellmen and   attendants. The average wage of a   worker is $23 an hour, compared with the $10 an hour made by a nonunionized Las Vegas hospitality worker or the $6 an hour Almada, who is 42 and who moved to the United States from the Mexico border town of Agua Prieta (she got her green card when she was 11, and became a citizen when she was 22) was paid at her last job in a    factory in Tucson. She said she was fired from that job for taking two months’ maternity leave, which prompted her and her (now former) husband to move to Las Vegas. They had heard that there were jobs at the casinos, where 90 percent of the hospitality work force on the Strip belong to the culinary union. But it was only after they divorced and she needed to support herself and her three children that Almada applied for her job at the Aria. That was six years ago. Almada enumerates all the ways that the job and its attendant union membership has improved her life: free health insurance and pharmacy benefits a pension job security and soon a $20, 000 down payment she will use to buy her first house. Initially she didn’t understand the benefits and regulations the union conferred. This is a common reason workers can still be taken advantage of, particularly those who don’t speak English. For the past seven months, though, Almada has been on an extended, contractually allowed,   leave of absence to serve as an organizer at Mandalay Bay Casino she is teaching other workers to read and understand their own contracts. “I never had these rights in Arizona,” she said. “Because I had my little one, they fired me and nobody helped me. If I was working here with the union, that doesn’t happen to me. ” Amanda Fortini is a contributing editor at Elle magazine and a visiting lecturer at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. Boston • The Pipe Fitter By Carlo Rotella From the job site in Roxbury where he works as a union pipe fitter, Nate Awan can see the building that once housed the Phillis Wheatley Middle School, from which he was expelled for fighting and other misbehavior. “That was back in my knucklehead time,” he said. The fifth child of an overwhelmed single mother, Awan was kicked out of four schools and took a bullet in the shoulder before going to prison at 18 for trying to shoot a rival gang member. While serving a   sentence, he resolved that he would change his fate. With the help of a former prosecutor who took an interest in his rehabilitation, Awan found his way into Operation Exit, a program founded in 2014 in which the city of Boston partners with unions to channel residents with criminal backgrounds into the trades. Having sampled carpentry,   work and other options, Awan, who had always been fascinated by welding but doesn’t like heights, chose pipe fitting over iron work. There’s plenty of politics in the building trades, but there’s also an ethos of craft meritocracy. “It’s not what you look like, it’s what your clevis hangers look like,” Awan said, referring to the brackets used to support pipes. “All at the same level, nothing crooked. It’s about your work ethic. ” He’s already planning to get his    son into the local when he’s old enough. Awan, who is 28 and currently a   apprentice making $30 an hour plus benefits, can become a journeyman in three years, and he looks forward to continuing up the scale of seniority and pay toward the top rate of $50 or so an hour. He still lives near the Four Corners section of Dorchester where he grew up, but he’s shopping for a house outside the city. “You come from no money for food, nothing, to where you’re buying a house, buying a car,” he said. “Your son needs a school uniform, you can get him one. ” Boston’s mayor, Martin Walsh, intends Operation Exit to enable this kind of transformation of prospects and consciousness. Walsh, who also grew up in Dorchester and had his own troubles (a bullet grazed his leg) before putting his life on course in the building trades, says: “We’ve had 80 graduates come through this program, and we’re expanding from the building trades into coding and culinary arts. Some of these guys were impact players on the street. It has an effect. ” Programs that reduce crime by connecting offenders and potential offenders to meaningful work are getting more attention across the country. Some, like Operation Exit, focus on   after prison others, like the Chicago CRED initiative recently started by the Emerson Collective and Arne Duncan, the former U. S. secretary of education, try to reduce gun violence by teaching job and life skills to young men adrift from both school and the labor market. It takes a significant investment of time and resources to shift a life from a   trajectory to a viable future in this way, but Awan testifies to the approach’s effectiveness. “I’m no surgeon or   prosecutor,” he said, “but for me  —   a product of his environment, taken from my mother at 9, incarcerated at 18, sweeping and mopping in the hole in prison for 19 cents an hour, living like a peasant  —   this here is a lottery ticket. ” Carlo Rotella is the director of American studies at Boston College and the author, most recently, of “Playing in Time. ”	1
315	If you were disappointed that Bill Maher brought Milo Yiannopoulos onto his HBO show “Real Time” last week, Mr. Maher is not especially bothered. In a telephone interview on Tuesday night, Mr. Maher batted back criticism of the booking by arguing that the appearance of Mr. Yiannopoulos actually helped expose the incendiary   personality’s views to a wider audience and hasten his sudden downfall. Mr. Yiannopoulos’s collapse was set in motion Sunday when a conservative group called the Reagan Battalion resurfaced a 2016 interview in which he endorsed sexual relations with boys as young as 13. Mr. Yiannopoulos  —   known for a history of offensive remarks about Muslims, Jews, transgender people and other groups, and as a ringleader in a notorious incident of online harassment  —   lost a speaking slot at the Conservative Political Action Conference and a book deal with Simon  Schuster, and then said on Tuesday that he was resigning as a senior editor from Breitbart News. Mr. Maher has been dealing for days with the fallout from his booking of  Mr. Yiannopoulos. The journalist Jeremy Scahill, who had been scheduled to appear on the same episode, withdrew from the show. Mr. Maher has defended the booking on   grounds, saying last week that if Mr. Yiannopoulos was indeed a monster, “nothing could serve the liberal cause better than having him exposed. ” But following the show, Mr. Maher came under attack for the chummy and conciliatory vibe of his conversation with Mr. Yiannopoulos and for a panel segment, broadcast online, in which his guest made more inflammatory remarks that seemed to go unchallenged. Speaking on Tuesday night, Mr. Maher, who counts himself as a liberal, did not sound particularly chastened by these assessments. He said he knew his interview with Mr. Yiannopoulos would never be satisfactory to some viewers. “No matter what I did,” he said, “it was never going to be enough for that slice of liberalism that would much rather judge a friend than engage an enemy, because it’s easier. ” Mr. Maher spoke further about the experience of having Mr. Yiannopoulos on “Real Time” and its aftermath, and why he will continue to seek out provocative conservative guests. These are edited excerpts from that conversation. Given all that has transpired since Friday’s show, how do you feel now about your decision to have Milo Yiannopoulos as a guest, and how those segments transpired? Well, let’s recap. About a week ago, I went on Van Jones’s show, and somebody asked me about the booking. I hadn’t really gotten into the details of Milo yet. He was just getting on my radar. I said, specifically, sunlight is the best disinfectant. Then we had Milo on, despite the fact that many people said, “Oh, how dare you give a platform to this man. ” What I think people saw was an emotionally needy Ann Coulter wannabe, trying to make a buck off of the left’s propensity for outrage. And by the end of the weekend, by dinnertime Monday, he’s dropped as a speaker at CPAC. Then he’s dropped by Breitbart, and his book deal falls through. As I say, sunlight is the best disinfectant. You’re welcome. You think his appearance on “Real Time” helped lead to his downfall? That’s what I was just saying. And by the way, I wasn’t trying to get him removed from society. I’m somebody who, many times, people have tried to make go away. They were successful that one time, for six months in 23 years, because that’s how long it was between the two shows [“Real Time” and “Politically Incorrect,” Mr. Maher’s previous talk show, which aired on Comedy Central and ABC]. It just rubs me the wrong way when somebody says, “I don’t like what this person is saying  —   he should go away. ” Do you feel that way even about the kinds of things Milo was saying on your show, or in the other platforms he was given? Can he do damage? I suppose he can. To a degree. Not a great degree, I don’t think. Could he offend people? Could he even inspire a borderline person to do something violent? I guess so. But nothing is free in life. People seem to want to live in this world where everything is a  . That’s not how life works. Could there have been more accountability in your segments with him? For instance, it seemed like he was allowed to grossly understate his role in harassing Leslie Jones on Twitter.  It’s not my job to hold him accountable to everything he’s ever said or done. I had eight minutes with him, on the show itself. Sorry I don’t have time to go over everything everybody else would want to do. We just had time to, sort of, start a discussion of the broad view of who he is. I don’t think he frankly knows what he’s going to say half the time, or knows what his philosophy is. But to see him as this monster is a little crazy. You know what he is? He’s the little impish, bratty kid brother. And the liberals are his older teenager sisters who are having a sleepover and he puts a spider in their sleeping bag so he can watch them scream. So how does someone deal with a personality like Milo, who is going much, much further than other guests, saying things that are demonstrably false? The president says 10 things a day that are provably wrong. If I threw everyone off my show who says things that are provably wrong, I’d never book a conservative and probably half the liberals. When he said that transgender people have a “psychiatric disorder,” do you just move on from that? Move on? It dominated the entire [online] segment. The other guests attacked him. When I say, “That’s not unreasonable” [to not want to share a bathroom with a transgender person] it’s because women have said that to me: “I want to know,” or “I’m not comfortable with someone in the bathroom, even if they, in their minds, have decided they are a woman. ” Doesn’t that opinion count at all? But you don’t agree that transgender people have a psychiatric disorder.  No, I don’t agree with that. But I don’t know that much about the situation. If somebody feels like they’re a woman, fine, then you’re a woman. I’m O. K. with that. If they’ve studied that, and they say it’s not a psychiatric disorder, I’m O. K. with that too. If that’s what scientists decided, that it’s not any psychological disorder, it’s fine with me. I agree. Since the start of your new season, you have had other guests like Tomi Lahren and Piers Morgan  —   not nearly as provocative, but with whom liberal viewers aren’t likely to agree. Are you trying to create conflict on your panels, or rile up your audience? I’ve never tried to push anybody’s buttons. I think everybody else in TV  —   everybody else who does political commentary in a comedic way  —   they’re all in one box. It’s so predictable, what they’re going to do, which is, never say anything that would make anything  —   that would make any liberal give the slightest bit of discomfort. I do a show about what’s happening that week in the news. Trump is president. I’m glad that we have enough credibility with both sides, that people who are Trump supporters will still do the show. Going back to “Politically Incorrect,” you booked conservatives like Ann Coulter and Kellyanne Conway  —   —   And Laura Ingraham. We had a whole cadre of blond conservatives. There was a fourth woman conservative we used to book in those days, who we kind of discovered  —   her name was Arianna Huffington. Even after your experience with Milo, do you still want to have guests your viewers haven’t encountered or might want to avoid? Yes. I like people who push the limits. I like people who are not afraid to take the slings and arrows, because they’re going to explore what’s on the edge. Now, is this guy over the edge? Yes. I mean, he’s a little cuckoo. But I would rather err on that side than on the side where everybody else is.	1
96	Before the rapper   of A Tribe Called Quest shouted “Resist! Resist! Resist!” at the top of his lungs at the Grammy Awards before Busta Rhymes called Donald J. Trump “President Agent Orange” and referenced his “unsuccessful attempt at the Muslim ban” before Tribe and Anderson . Paak kicked their way through an oversize wall and brought dozens of people of a wide range of nationalities onstage (along with a dance troupe that recalled Public Enemy’s   S1Ws)   introduced his group’s performance with some words of encouragement and defiance: “We’d like to say to all of those people around the world, all of those people who are pushing people who are in power to represent them: Tonight, we represent you. ” These were words for the disenfranchised from a stage that has long connoted power and influence. In the current political moment, in which membership in the American experiment is subject to greater and greater obstacles, this performance was a loud statement of pushback. That is especially true given that the Grammys find themselves in the throes of similar friction over belonging. Simply put, the Grammys, like America, have an inclusion problem  —   or more to the point, an exclusion problem. The 59th annual installment of the ceremony, at the Staples Center in Los Angeles on Sunday night, was as noteworthy for who won as who didn’t, for who attended as for who opted to sit out. It was a show about borders  —   who is allowed to cross, who isn’t and who doesn’t even bother trying. Adele won all five Grammys she was nominated for, including album of the year (for “25”) record of the year and song of the year (for “Hello”) besting Beyoncé in all three categories. “25” is Adele’s least impressive album, but its    soul belting is the sort of classicism likely to appeal to the Recording Academy voting members, who tend to skew older and more traditional. Beyoncé’s album “Lemonade” (and the song “Formation,” nominated in the other two categories) is musically provocative and wide ranging, and rife with commentary about the meaning of blackness in the United States. At the end of the night, when Adele won album of the year, she deferred to Beyoncé: “The way that you make me and my friends feel, the way you make my black friends feel, is empowering,” Adele told her from the stage, while behind her, a huge gaggle of predominantly white male songwriters and producers clapped enthusiastically. In that moment, just a few feet separated Adele and Beyoncé, but the chasm between their treatment by the Grammys was huge, and potentially unbridgeable. It was #GrammysSoWhite come to life. For years, Kanye West has complained about how black artists  —   himself, but also others  —   are mistreated in the main Grammy categories. This year, Frank Ocean, fatigued with the Grammys’ handling of black music, opted to not even submit his music for consideration. (The other big   category, best new artist, was won by a black artist, Chance the Rapper.) The Grammys’ race problem is so pernicious that some white winners have chosen contrition over exuberance  —   Adele’s embrace of Beyoncé, Macklemore’s apology to Kendrick Lamar in 2014 (Macklemore reportedly did not submit his most recent album for consideration this year)  —   demonstrating a greater understanding of the fundamental imbalance of the Grammys system than the Grammys themselves. Despite minor rule changes and lip service to the idea of better representation, the Grammys remain on the defensive. In the days leading up to this year’s telecast, the show’s longtime producer, Ken Ehrlich, deflected Mr. Ocean’s criticisms in an interview with Rolling Stone, earning a rebuke from Mr. Ocean on Tumblr: “Use the old gramophone to actually listen bro, I’m one of the best alive. And if you’re up for a discussion about the cultural bias and general nerve damage the show you produce suffers from then I’m all for it. ” The Grammys’ consistent celebration of   white acts feels like   rule in an evenly divided nation, while the royalty from the other side  —   Beyoncé and Jay Z, Jennifer Lopez, Rihanna  —   looks on politely from the front rows. (Or, in the case of Mr. West and Mr. Ocean, who did not attend the Grammys, not even looking on.) There was also frisson in the ceremony’s lumpy attempts to bridge the age gap: When the show tried to highlight the work of Neil Diamond, via a clumsily executed version of James Corden’s “Carpool Karaoke” routine, it was clear that most of the assembled stars didn’t know the words to “Sweet Caroline. ” And in a country in which around 15 percent of the population  —   more than 50 million people  —   speaks Spanish, there were no   or even bilingual, performances. The language was heard only during the   segment, and in a Johnnie Walker ad that featured a pointed bilingual cover of “This Land Is Your Land” by the Los Angeles band Chicano Batman. Again, strictly controlled borders. It’s in these moments that the Grammys’ lack of imagination and tolerance contrasts with the general progressive political stances of the artists it celebrates. During the show, Ms. Lopez quoted Toni Morrison on the role of art in fraught political times. Katy Perry performed “Chained to the Rhythm,” her new    single, with an armband that read “PERSIST”  —   a reference to  Elizabeth Warren’s recent Senate silencing  —   and concluded in front of an image of the Constitution. Beyoncé performed in a gold crown that suggested a futuristic Lady Liberty, and during her acceptance speech for best urban contemporary album, preached about the power of inclusion: “It’s important to me to show images to my children that reflect their beauty, so they can grow up in a world where they look in the mirror, first through their own families  —   as well as the news, the Super Bowl, the Olympics, the White House and the Grammys  —   and see themselves, and have no doubt that they’re beautiful, intelligent and capable. ” Honoring Beyoncé in categories devoted to black music goes part of the way to fulfilling that vision, but it’s where she’s not honored that feels more pointed: She has won 22 times, but only four of those awards have been in   categories. (She has lost album of the year three times, to Beck, Taylor Swift and Adele.) So long as the Grammys continue to strike a blow for the values of yesteryear over the energy of today, they will remain an agent of the status quo, not resistance or evolution. But when an institution stands still while its citizens are pressing for change, how long can the borders hold before everyone outside is let in, or everyone inside decides it’s not worth staying, and leaves?	1
121	Some would say that the true stars of this year’s Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show, which arrived in New York this week, are the cats. Featured as part of a collaboration with the International Cat Association, the cats drew consternation from some dog handlers, who felt the parvenus did not belong. The cats, being cats, did not care. They dressed up or dressed down, leapt through the occasional hoop and gazed witheringly on the efforts of their human and canine compatriots. Oh, to be a cat and be above it all. For the photographer Vincent Tullo, the cats offered another attraction as well: They brought him and his camera to the show’s fringes, where the   discipline of the main events gave way to curious hoodies and whimsy. “The cat people were much more playful than the dog people,” said Mr. Tullo, who is a dog owner. “I’d go to the cat section, and all the owners were laughing. The judges were laughing. Then I’d go to the dog section, and people would get mad at you for taking pictures of their dog. It’s a little strange that people take a puppy this seriously. The dogs want to relax and play. They try to walk over to you and sniff you, and the owners pull them back. ” The truly exotic creatures at the event, of course, are the handlers, who spend four hours or more wetting and drying their dogs’ hair for the grooming competition. Before the dogs’ agility competition, handlers were given the opportunity to practice the obstacle course  —   but without their dogs. “It was the weirdest thing,” Mr. Tullo said. “There were 20 or 30 people running in circles, saying, ‘Good boy,’ and not a single dog in sight. ” The cats, no doubt, had a good chuckle at that one. Meow.	1

Mr. McConaughey announced in an interview yesterday that he is actually moving to the small town of Mulvane, located 25 miles south of Wichita. “I like Kansas and I like the people there. The people there are real. They’re genuine and I don’t have to question their sincerity and I think it would be a hell of a great place to raise my family.”We’re told that Mr. McConaughey discovered the town while driving through the area not long ago and apparently fell in love with the small town and the state of Kansas. We’re not sure what the residents of the town will think about his move there but we imagine he’ll be received with a warm welcome. If nothing else, having such a famous resident will undoubtedly be a bit of an economic boon for the town.

He recently visited Beaver Falls while scouting out a film location with producer Jerry Bruckheimer and, according to Bruckheimer, “Tom immediately fell in love with the relaxed lifestyle and the tranquil beauty of the surrounding countryside and was telling everyone that he was going to move there.” Not a lot of people have heard of the small town of Breaux Bridge, Louisiana but Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie sure have. Located near Lafayette, Louisiana, Breaux Bridge is an artsy town known as the Crawfish Capital of the World and filled with people who have almost no connection to the Hollywood lifestyle that Brad and Angelina desperately want to avoid and that’s exactly what they like about it. Though they have a home in France and are still looking for a home in the UK they’ve decided to move back to the US to be closer to Hollywood, but not too close.Angelina had recently visited Breaux Bridge while scouting out a film location and according to insiders, “Angelina immediately fell in love with the relaxed lifestyle and the small town southern charm of Breaux Bridge and was telling everyone that they were going to move there.” Brad, who was with her, apparently agreed. “It would be a great place to raise their kids,” sources claimed.

36	She calls it the “  clause. ” When Sahar Kian needed a new roommate for the home she shares near Georgetown University, she did what many young people here do: She took out an ad on Craigslist and then set down a few ground rules. “Alcohol, pets and meat products are not allowed in the house,” Ms. Kian wrote. “Neither are Trump supporters,” she added. Ms. Kian, 23, is not the first person to add such a clause to a quest for a roommate. A steady trickle of posts like hers have shown up, one or two at a time, on Craigslist since President Trump was inaugurated on Jan. 20. As anyone who has started out in the Washington area with few contacts and an   salary knows, finding a roommate (or three) to share a high rent is common practice. The median cost for a   apartment is around $1, 990 a month, according to Zumper, a rental aggregator. But for some, it’s becoming more important to make sure that political views align before they split the cost with a stranger. On Twitter, Reddit and Craigslist and in Facebook groups, people have been screening for Trump supporters since at least last fall. Such ads, more than a dozen of which have been posted on Craigslist since Inauguration Day, are only a tiny fraction of the thousands of posts on the site, but they nonetheless represent a small act of defiance in an area that heavily favored Hillary Clinton and where residents have remained politically active since the election. “I can’t live with someone who supports a ‘leader’ with those types of ideals,” Jessica, 32, a teacher who did not want her last name used because she feared harassment online, wrote in an email. She posted an ad on Craiglist for a room share shortly after the inauguration. “I feel like I’m going to a protest every single day. ” In one recent ad, a couple in the area who identified themselves as “ ” and liberal advertised a $500 room in their home: “If you’re racist, sexist, homophobic or a Trump supporter please don’t respond. We won’t get along. ” In another, two women in their 20s were searching for a roommate to take over a   room in their Columbia Heights apartment for $550. The women detailed their love of happy hours, a “good Netflix sesh,” pho and tacos. “We’re open to any    ” they added, “so long as you didn’t vote for Trump. In the same neighborhood, a woman posted an ad searching for someone to take over her room: “Trump supporters this is not the house for you (no, seriously),” she wrote. For her part, Ms. Kian, who works at Amideast, a nonprofit that focuses on educational opportunities for Middle Eastern and African students, is fine with taking the extra step to make sure her political filter extends to her home. Ms. Kian, who has American and Iranian citizenship and was raised Muslim, said the idea of the   clause started out as a joke. But it grew serious, she said, after the president signed an executive order that barred people from seven predominantly Muslim countries from entering the United States. “Anybody who is on board with that kind of thinking is not welcome,” she said. Whoever ends up living with her will pay $1, 300 to share the top floor of the house. (Her parents live downstairs.) People who support Mr. Trump, she said, would not be interested in living in her “raging liberal” house. “Frankly, it would not work out,” Ms. Kian said in an interview. “That person would not be comfortable here because we bash Trump nightly. ” People like Ms. Kian may be closing themselves off to others, but their actions are legal, according to Sheila C. Salmon, a Washington lawyer who specializes in housing law. Political views are not protected under the Fair Housing Act, which prohibits discrimination based on such factors as race, religion, national origin and disability. “I don’t see anything illegal about it,” Ms. Salmon said. “It’s like saying you don’t want any nonsmokers. ” Washington has a set of expanded protections that include political affiliation, but Ms. Salmon said it was unclear whether a person’s support of Mr. Trump would fall into this category. “Would it truly be rejection or discrimination on political affiliation?” she said. “I think there’s a reasonable argument to be made that it’s not. ” Kevin Kemp, 29, who works in advertising at Education Week, is another resident who is screening out Trump supporters. Mr. Kemp said he used to subtly gauge the politics of potential roommates by making jokes and seeing how they responded. But about a month ago, when he was searching for a roommate to share a   apartment in Silver Spring, Md. he found himself going a step further as he drafted a post on Reddit. “Please no Imperial Sympathizers, Borg, Vogons, Lannisters (some exceptions) Sith or Trump supporters,” he wrote in a post for a roommate, invoking some of fiction’s most notorious villains. His joke, he said, reflected a deeper frustration. “As a black man, Black Lives Matter is sort of important to me,” he said. “And Trump supporters aren’t known for their fondness of that movement. ” On the other end of the spectrum, people who identify as conservative and support Mr. Trump are navigating difficult terrain. Cole Lyle, a Marine veteran who recently moved here to lobby for funding to provide wounded veterans with service dogs, is using Craigslist and    among his friends to find roommates. He said he was open to living with anyone, but added that the pool of potential roommates who share his political beliefs was small. “D. C. is a small town,” Mr. Lyle said. “Republican D. C. is a smaller town, and conservative Republican D. C. is tiny. ” Mr. Lyle, 27, a former intern with the conservative Heritage Foundation, is for the moment staying in the think tank’s intern residence. He said that he hoped that he and his service dog, Kaya, would eventually live in a place where he could find common ground with someone  —   “dogs are the key to bipartisanship”  —   but that he did not want to live with anyone who would reject him because of his political views. “If somebody’s going to put that in an ad, they’re not the type of person I’d want to associate with,” he said. “If someone said, ‘I will not live with a liberal,’ I would probably be equally as likely not to engage with that person. ” But Ms. Kian, who has lived in Washington only since the Obama era, said she was likely to keep screening out Trump supporters. “I’m not quite sure what this city is going to look like,” Ms. Kian said. “That’s even more reason for me to keep that   supporters clause in there. ”	1

689	 Early this morning, drug kingpin Joaquin ‘El Chapo’ Guzmán, head of the Sinaloa Cartel, escaped from the Altiplano maximum security prison once again.This is now the third time Guzmán has escaped from a Mexican prison and brings into question Mexico’s ability to keep corruption out of it’s penal system.In 1993, Guzmán was captured in Guatemala, extradited and sentenced to 20 years in prison in Mexico for murder and drug trafficking. In 2001, after bribing Mexican prison guards, he was able to escape from a federal maximum-security prison in 2001. On February 22nd, 2014, Guzmán was found inside his fourth-floor condominium in Mazatlán, Sinaloa, and was captured without any gunshots being fired. Guzmán escaped from prison again on July 11th, 2015 by exiting through a tunnel that led to a nearby construction site. He was recaptured by Mexican marines following a shootout at Guzman’s hideout in Mexico on January 8th, 2016.	0

270	MANILA  —   A retired police officer racked with guilt over the murders of two of his own brothers has reversed himself and confessed to leading the Philippine death squad that killed them, saying that he was acting on the direct orders of Rodrigo Duterte before he became president. The former officer, Arthur Lascañas, said at a news conference on Monday that Mr. Duterte had sponsored the killings of drug and crime suspects while he was mayor of the southern city of Davao. Mr. Lascañas has now become the second professed hit man to level such accusations against Mr. Duterte. At least 3, 600 people, and possibly thousands more, have been killed by the police or vigilantes since Mr. Duterte became president in June. Rights groups have said that the police may have ordered the extrajudicial killings of drug dealers and users, a charge that officials have denied. Mr. Duterte’s spokesman, Martin Andanar, on Monday dismissed Mr. Lascañas’s allegations as “part of a protracted political drama” intended to undermine the president’s leadership. Mr. Lascañas, 56, said that he was the leader of the Davao Death Squad, a group that he said Mr. Duterte had formed to go after   drug dealers and petty criminals but that later evolved into a force to eliminate political opponents. He is the second person claiming membership in the squad to speak out against Mr. Duterte, bolstering the explosive testimony of another professed hit man, Edgar Matobato, who has been in hiding since last year, when he linked the president to the killings. On Monday, Mr. Lascañas broke down in tears and said Mr. Matobato’s accusations were true. “We started the salvaging of people when Mayor Duterte first sat down as mayor in Davao City,” he said. “The people we targeted are criminals and were into illegal drugs. We were implementing the personal orders of Duterte. ” “Salvaging” is a euphemism in the Philippines for summary executions. Mr. Lascañas said members of the squad were usually paid $400 to $1, 000 for the killings “depending on the status” of the target. “All the killings that we committed in Davao City, whether they were buried or thrown in the sea, were paid for by Mayor Duterte,” he said. Mr. Lascañas said that he received an allowance directly from Mr. Duterte’s office and that he had led the group for a long time. He said his earlier testimony, made before the Senate last year, was “all lies. ” He said that two of his brothers  —   whom he identified as Cecilio and Fernando  —   were among the group’s victims and that he had concealed the details surrounding their deaths from the family until Monday. “They were involved in illegal drugs,” Mr. Lascañas said. “Now my nephews know that I was instrumental to the murders. In my belief about the campaign, I had committed this. ” He also confirmed Mr. Matobato’s earlier statement linking Mr. Duterte to the murder of Jun Pala, a radio commentator critical of the former mayor and a known supporter of a vigilante group in Davao guarding against Communist guerrillas. Mr. Lascañas said he was paid about $60, 000 to get rid of him. “We planned and carried out the assassination of Jun Pala,” he said. After Mr. Pala survived an ambush, Mr. Lascañas said, he met with Mr. Duterte, who told him to take his time in killing the broadcaster. Mr. Pala was shot by gunmen near his home in 2003, in a killing that the police attributed to a Communist rebel hit squad. “This is the real truth in the Pala murder case,” Mr. Lascañas said. “I am one of those who murdered him. ” Mr. Lascañas also said that he and other members of the squad killed a kidnapping suspect, his pregnant wife, his    and two servants. He said the victims were seized and taken to a quarry, where they were gunned down. He did not say how the bodies were disposed of, but last year Mr. Matobato testified that victims were chopped up and then their parts taken to sea to be scattered. It was not immediately clear what Mr. Lascañas would do next, but he has been under the protection of the Free Legal Assistance Group, an organization of rights advocates and lawyers who have criticized Mr. Duterte’s deadly campaign against drugs. The group said that Mr. Lascañas had drawn up a sworn affidavit and was ready to testify before any government body, including the Senate. Mr. Lascañas’s statements on Monday were in line with Mr. Matobato’s testimony last year. At the time, he said he was one of the first civilians Mr. Lascañas had recruited into the death squad, originally known as the Lambada Boys, that was responsible for kidnappings, killings and the bombing of a mosque in Davao. He said the squad answered to Mr. Duterte and his longtime lieutenant, Ronald dela Rosa, now director general of the Philippine National Police. Mr. Andanar, the president’s spokesman, said in his statement on Monday: “Our people are aware that this character assassination is nothing but vicious politics orchestrated by sectors affected by the reforms initiated by the Duterte administration. ” “Bringing change is not an easy task,” he added. “The Duterte administration has disturbed, disrupted the establishment. However, we remain undistracted in delivering goods and services to serve the people, not just the interest of the few. ” Senator Antonio Trillanes, who has been feuding with Mr. Duterte and who supported Mr. Matobato when he made his accusations last year, said that Mr. Andanar’s statement was intended to divert attention away from “the issue of the president’s complicity” in multiple murders. Senator Risa Hontiveros called Mr. Lascañas’s allegations a “direct stab at the credibility” of the president that undermined his “moral capacity to lead. ” “They strengthen suspicions that the death squads responsible for thousands of unsolved extrajudicial killings are ” Ms. Hontiveros said. She called on the Senate to investigate Mr. Lascañas’s accusations and respond to what she called the “public’s clamor for truth and accountability. ”	1

236	PALM BEACH, Fla.  —   For some of the businesses and government agencies that surround President Trump’s “Winter White House,” the effects of his frequent weekend getaways to    can best be told in numbers. ■ $200, 000 in lost fuel sales at a large local airport in a single   visit this month. ■ 75   at a new restaurant in just one night. ■ $60, 000 a day to pay overtime to sheriff’s deputies who guard the many closed roads, a tab that is about $1. 5 million over all since the election. ■ 250 private flights grounded every day. A month into his presidency, Mr. Trump arrived at    his private club here, for a third weekend in a row this Presidents’ Day weekend. For the locals, that’s at least three days of clogged roads and strict security protocols that hurt local businesses and frustrate residents. Although economic development officials are ecstatic over the free publicity provided by news reporters’ live waterfront shots  —   and the excited buzz in the area is palpable  —   others are exasperated over the drain on small businesses and the circuitous routes residents have to drive to avoid two miles of closed roads. Secret Service rules restricting private flights have grounded operations at  Palm Beach County Park Airport in Lantana, nine miles south of Mr. Trump’s club, where most of the business is conducted on Saturday and Sunday. That means no parachute jumping, banner advertising, flight lessons or chopper trips. Business owners there are hoping that a president who campaigned on improving the economic prospects of the little guy will be sympathetic to the havoc his visits wreak. “This is a good test of his words versus his actions,” said Jonathan Miller, whose company, Stellar Aviation Group, runs the airport. He said he had lost $30, 000 with each of the president’s visits. Dave Johnson, the owner of Palm Beach Aircraft Services, which maintains and operates planes at Lantana, said he employs eight people full time and provides transportation for clients including doctors, lawyers and other professionals who travel throughout the country for work. But when Mr. Trump is in town, no private flights can take off within a   radius, and arriving flights have to first stop elsewhere for security clearance. “We never dreamed that he’d be here every weekend  —   that’s the killer,” Mr. Johnson said. “I’m getting customers that have been with me for years, and they’re actually moving their aircraft to other airports so they can fly. ” The Palm Beach County airport director’s office tallied the losses during Mr. Trump’s visit Feb. 3 to 6 to   . A sightseeing business canceled 19 tours and turned away a dozen  . One flight school business had to scratch $14, 000 worth of flight lessons. One company is in negotiations to move its   fleet out of the county, which would mean a loss of a quarter of the airport’s fuel sales, according to the office’s analysis. “It’s a very busy airport with a lot of   men trying to make a living,” said Bruce Pelly, the airport director for Palm Beach County. “You got flight training, aeronautics, a propeller shop, paint shops, maintenance companies. You got all kinds of businesses going on down there. We are obviously trying whatever we can to get that airport functioning in some form or fashion. ” Mr. Pelly said he had “offered everything we can think of” to make the airport secure. The Secret Service’s response so far: “No. ” The White House and the Federal Aviation Administration referred calls about the matter to the Secret Service. The Secret Service did not respond to requests for comment. “In their view, that airport is too close to  ” Mr. Pelly said of his conversations with the Secret Service. “We are not giving up. ” Jorge Gonzalez, who owns SkyWords Advertising, said he might have to. He said his business had lost $42, 000 because of Mr. Trump’s visits, during which his   planes were grounded. He hopes to last through May, but his wife said that at this rate, 30 days was more likely. “We are hoping his visits slow to once a month,” Mr. Gonzalez said. This isn’t the first time a president’s travels have caused local disruptions. President Barack Obama’s visits to Hawaii were a source of frustration for pilots and aviation businesses there that had to abide by similar restrictions. And President Bill Clinton’s frequent visits to White Plains during his presidency brought additional chaos to an already busy Westchester County Airport. Sascha Bennemann opened Costa Palm Beach, a Mediterranean restaurant at the Esplanade shopping complex at the east end of the county’s toniest shopping district, Worth Avenue, just as Mr. Trump began his regular trips. On the second Saturday in February, when a   stretch of South Ocean Boulevard that runs in front of    was closed, cutting the town in two, 70 people did not show up for dinner, amounting to a loss of about $5, 000, Mr. Bennemann said. He showed a photo of himself golfing with Mr. Trump last year, to underscore: “It’s nothing personal. ” Mr. Bennemann noted that increased foot traffic had offset some of his losses, and other Worth Avenue shop owners also said the visits had brought an increase in pedestrians. “For us, we have had some of the best days ever on weekends,” said Tatiana Van Zandt, who owns Trillion, a luxury clothing store. “The hum is exciting. ” Kelly Smallridge, the president and chief executive of the Business Development Board of Palm Beach County, said her agency would never have been able to afford the countless hours of free publicity. “Certainly this is the greatest advertising campaign in terms of name recognition an economic development board can hope for,” Ms. Smallridge said. Although Palm Beach had already been viewed as a place to vacation or retire, Mr. Trump’s visits have brought “panache and glamour,” which have caught the attention of a wider spectrum of people, including hedge fund and money managers, she said. Laurel Baker, executive director of the Palm Beach Chamber of Commerce, said, “If we want to be the Pollyanna of Palm Beach, all of the focus on the town is wonderful. ” Residents on that   stretch of closed road have to carry ID cards to get back to their homes, even when out walking their dogs.    Club members must park their cars at a parking lot down the street to be screened before they can enter through the club’s south entrance. The road closing splits the island in half, forcing residents to drive off the island into neighboring West Palm Beach if they want to shop or eat on the other half. The road was closed again at 8 a. m. Friday and was expected to remain closed till late Monday evening. “No one is for road closures it’s an inconvenience,” said Kirk Blouin, the town’s public safety director. “But most recognize it’s a necessity for the security of the president. ” St. Catherine Greek Orthodox Church, in West Palm Beach at the western end of the Southern Boulevard Bridge, was holding its 42nd annual Greek Festival this weekend. “If they see the road closed, they will find something else to do,” said the Rev. Andrew Maginas, who said the festival was a critical  . “We pray for him at every service to do right by our country, but we are sad that his visit comes during our festival. “We are hoping he can build a helipad soon on    grounds. ”	1
484	WASHINGTON  —   The White House is fiercely divided over President Trump’s campaign promise to “cancel” the Paris agreement, the 2015 accord that binds nearly every country to curb global warming, with more moderate voices maintaining that he should stick with the agreement despite his campaign pledge. Stephen K. Bannon, Mr. Trump’s senior adviser, is pressing the president to officially pull the United States from the landmark accord, according to energy and government officials with knowledge of the debate. But, they say, he is clashing with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and the president’s daughter Ivanka Trump, who fear the move could have broad and damaging diplomatic ramifications. Mr. Trump vowed on the campaign trail to tear up President Barack Obama’s global warming policies, and on the home front he is moving aggressively to meet those pledges with deep cuts to the Environmental Protection Agency and a new E. P. A. administrator, Scott Pruitt, who is a skeptic of climate science. Next week, Mr. Trump plans to sign an executive order directing Mr. Pruitt to start the lengthy legal process of unwinding Mr. Obama’s E. P. A. regulations for cutting greenhouse pollution from   power plants. Those regulations are the linchpin of the last administration’s program to meet the nation’s obligations to reduce climate emissions under the Paris agreement. While the president cannot, as Mr. Trump suggested, unilaterally undo a   accord that has already been legally ratified, he could initiate the   process to withdraw the world’s largest economy and   climate polluter from the first worldwide deal to tackle global warming. Such a move would rend a global deal that has been hailed as historic, throwing into question the fate of global climate policy and, diplomats say, the credibility of the United States. But it would also demonstrate to his supporters that Mr. Trump is a man of his word, putting American coal interests ahead of a global deal forged by Mr. Obama. On one side of that debate is Mr. Bannon, who as a former chief executive of Breitbart News published countless articles denouncing climate change as a hoax, and who has vowed to push Mr. Trump to transform all his major campaign promises into policy actions. On the other side are Ms. Trump, Mr. Tillerson, and a slew of foreign policy advisers and career diplomats who argue that the fallout of withdrawing from the accord could be severe, undercutting the United States’ credibility on other foreign policy issues and damaging relations with key allies. Although Ms. Trump has not spoken out publicly for action to combat climate change, proponents and opponents of such action see her as an ally. Former Vice President Al Gore met with her during the Trump transition, and was ushered in by the “first daughter” to see the  . The actor and activist Leonardo DiCaprio even slipped her a DVD copy of his   documentary. “President Trump Must Not Wobble on Climate Change  —   No Matter What Ivanka Says   …   ” blared a Breitbart post on Monday written by James Delingpole, who is close to Mr. Bannon and who leads the website’s coverage of   policy. Mr. Trump wants to make a decision by next week, say people familiar with the White House’s debate on the climate pact, in order to announce his executive order to undo Mr. Obama’s climate regulations in conjunction with his plans for the Paris deal. According to leaked budget documents, the president will also propose killing off nearly two dozen E. P. A. programs, including the   Clean Power Program, climate partnership programs with local governments, Energy Star grants to encourage efficiency research in consumer products and   research. Those would be part of a broader budget submission that would cut the E. P. A. ’s funding by 25 percent, to around $6. 1 billion from $8. 2 billion, and its staff by 20 percent. “If the goal is to fulfill the president’s campaign promises and implement his agenda, there is no value in staying in Paris,” said Thomas J. Pyle, an adviser to the Trump transition and the president of the Institute for Energy Research, an organization partly funded by the billionaire brothers Charles G. and David H. Koch, who have worked for years to undermine   policies. Mr. Trump has cited Mr. Pyle’s group as being influential in shaping his energy and climate proposals, including his campaign pledge to withdraw from the Paris deal. “The two greatest obstacles to a Clexit (climate exit from U. N. Paris agreement) are probably Ivanka and Tillerson,” wrote Marc Morano, a former Republican Senate staff member who now runs Climate Depot, a     website that promotes the denial of climate science, in an email. “Tillerson with his ‘seat at the table’ views could be biggest proponent of not withdrawing the U. S. from the agreement. ” Mr. Tillerson is a former chief executive of Exxon Mobil, which, like many major global corporations, endorsed the Paris agreement. While his former company once denied   climate change, it has more recently publicly acknowledged the threat posed by burning oil and supported proposals to tax carbon dioxide pollution. Asked during his Senate confirmation hearing about the Paris accord, Mr. Tillerson said, “It’s important that the U. S. maintains its seat at the table about how to address the threat of climate change, which does require a global response. ” Under the Paris agreement, every nation has formally submitted plans detailing how it expects to lower its   pollution. The Obama administration pledged that the United States would reduce its carbon pollution about 26 percent from 2005 levels by 2025. However, that pledge depends on enactment of Mr. Obama’s E. P. A. regulations on   power plants, which Mr. Trump and Mr. Pruitt intend to substantially weaken or eliminate. But under the Paris deal, those numerical targets are not legally binding, and there are no sanctions for failing to meet them. The primary legal requirements of the deal are that countries publicly put forth their emissions reductions targets, and later put forth reports verifying how they are meeting the targets. It would be possible for the Trump administration to stay in the deal and submit a less ambitious target. Even senior Republican voices in the foreign policy debate have said it may be wiser to stay in but keep a low profile. “There’s really no obligation,” Senator Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee and chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, said in an interview. “It doesn’t require us to do anything. I think they may take a little time to assess whether pulling out makes sense now. ” Foreign policy experts say withdrawing from Paris would have far greater diplomatic consequences than President George W. Bush’s withdrawal from the world’s first global   accord, the 1997 Kyoto Protocol. “I think it would be a major mistake, even a historic mistake, to disavow the Paris deal,” said R. Nicholas Burns, a retired career diplomat and under secretary of state under Mr. Bush. “In international politics, trust, reliability and keeping your commitments  —   that’s a big part of how other countries view our country,” Mr. Burns said. “I can’t think of an issue, except perhaps NATO, where if the U. S. simply walks away, it would have such a major negative impact on how we are seen. ” The Paris deal is more consequential than Kyoto. Unlike that pact, which required action only from developed economies, the Paris agreement includes commitments from every nation, rich and poor, to cut emissions, including China and India, the world’s largest and   polluters. Also, the science of climate change has become far more certain and the impact more visible in the 20 years since Kyoto. Each of the last three years has surpassed the previous one as the hottest on record. Some of the United States’ closest allies are urging the Trump administration not to pull out. In a letter to Mr. Trump after he won the election, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany wrote, “Partnership with the United States is and will remain a keystone of German foreign policy, especially so that we can tackle the great challenges of our time. ” They include, she wrote, “working to develop farsighted climate policy. ” As Mr. Trump and his advisers weigh their Paris options, one proposal is gaining traction, according to participants in the debate: Mr. Trump could declare that the Paris agreement is a treaty that requires ratification by the Senate. The pact was designed not to have the legal force of a treaty specifically so that it would not have to go before the United States Senate, which would have assuredly failed to ratify it. “If there are camps forming in the White House, then let the people decide, the elected representatives,” Mr. Pyle said. “Let’s put the question to them. ” Proponents of that idea say it could shift some of the weight of the decision from Mr. Trump to Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, at least in the eyes of some foreign diplomats, and of the president’s daughter.	1
492	American mothers infected with the Zika virus last year were 20 times as likely to give birth to babies with birth defects as mothers who gave birth two years before the epidemic, federal health officials said on Thursday. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concluded last April that Zika infection caused severe birth defects, including the abnormally small heads of microcephaly, but it had not previously estimated how common such defects were. A new study, published in the agency’s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, looked at several hundred pregnant women entered into the C. D. C. ’s Zika Pregnancy Registry after lab tests indicated they had probably had the virus. The study compared their birth outcomes to those found in historic registries of birth defects kept in Massachusetts, North Carolina and Georgia. It found that in 2013 and 2014, those states’ typical rate of severe birth defects  —   including microcephaly, brain abnormalities, eye defects or central nervous system problems  —   was about 3 out of every 1, 000 live births. By contrast, the 442 women in the pregnancy registry had 26 infants and fetuses with similar defects, which would be a rate of about 60 out of every 1, 000 pregnancy outcomes, including live births, miscarriages and abortions. Comparing a rate based on live births  —   which is what the states tally  —   to a rate based on a C. D. C. tally of all pregnancy outcomes “is not a perfect comparison,” conceded Margaret A. Honein, chief of the C. D. C. ’s birth defects branch and one of the study’s authors. “But the difference between three times per thousand and 60 times per thousand does give you the magnitude of the increase. ” The study showed the importance of keeping birth defects registries, the C. D. C. said, and reiterated that Zika is extremely dangerous to fetuses. The agency continues to recommend that pregnant women not travel to areas with Zika. Not every American woman who had Zika is being followed in the pregnancy registry. Some who picked up the virus during travel never showed symptoms, and some were given tests that were inaccurate. In the District of Columbia, for example, tests on about 300 women are now being redone. The Washington Post reported that lab workers there misread labels and watered down test solution that was already diluted, producing false negative results. Federal officials do not think any other state or city laboratory had the same problem. Women in Puerto Rico, which had a major outbreak of the virus, are in a separate C. D. C. registry.	1

110	NIGHT OF FIREBy Colin Thubron361 pp.   Publishers. $26. 99. The first oddity lies in the precise accuracy of the title. Those three words convey no coy metaphor for passion or anger, no euphemistic allusion to military bombardment. Colin Thubron’s “Night of Fire” is literally about a house that burns down at night, killing all its inhabitants. Lest you think I am a killjoy for giving away the plot, let me assure you that plot is the least of what this book has to offer. Structurally, it’s unlike any other novel I’ve read. It starts over at every chapter with a new character, and yet the fates of the seven central characters are so intimately linked that the story feels cumulative. The resemblance of each chapter to the next  —   intense memories, followed by death  —   should feel repetitious, but it doesn’t. Instead, the sensation is rather like reading a long, dirgelike poem in which the refrain comes back again and again. We do not exactly welcome these expected deaths, but we somehow become used to them. Time and place remain vague. An opening assertion that the rickety old house was built “years ago, at the end of the Victorian century,” along with a   reference to Bakelite sockets and dustbins and common English shrubs, combines with other details in the lives of the individual characters to put the location somewhere in Britain and the period somewhere near ours. There are no mentions of cellphones or internet searches or other   markers, and some of the tenants’ memories hark back to midcentury childhoods. On the other hand, the science of neurosurgery is being practiced in its modern form here, so we can’t be too much farther back than the last few years of the 20th century. The story itself is not exactly a timeless fable (as in, say, Hanya Yanagihara’s “A Little Life,” where 30 or 40 years pass without external, historical changes) but it nonetheless refuses to be pinned down to a particular night of fire in a particular place. This hankering after a generalized condition comes to make more and more sense as the chapters progress. At first, we think we are simply being introduced to each victim in turn: the landlord who lives at the top of the house, the priest who lives on the ground floor, the neurosurgeon who lives just above him, the photographer who occupies the basement. But by the time we get to the photographer, things have begun to seem less distinct. All of these people have a dead mother, usually one who died when the character was still young. What are the chances of that in the general population? Other elements, too, begin to recur: fondly recalled girlfriends with eyes that slant upward at the sides brain tumors whose excision leaves memory gaps a boy who hangs himself a beloved black woman a lesbian professor of biology. The memory pool, initially sharp and distinct for each character, starts to blur together. Still, we never stop believing in each as a separate individual. The strength of Thubron’s method is that it allows for strongly established characters, with their own histories and quirks, even as it enacts a discernible process of authorial repetition. Always beginning in the   voice, each chapter at some point moves into the first person, almost without our noticing the shift  —   until, just before the character’s death, the perspective moves back to the third person again. In no case, though, is anyone truly seen from the outside. We do not experience the moments after each victim’s death, nor do we learn anything about these people that they could not have told us themselves. As we come to see, these seven people have more in common than their separate professions or chapter titles would suggest. Aside from the landlord’s sick wife, who makes a brief appearance at the end, only one of the central characters, labeled “Naturalist,” is a woman. Yet she’s just as convincing in her reality, just as persuasive in her perspective, as the male characters who borrow their author’s gender (and presumably some of his memories). Moreover, because she shares so many other things with her fellow fire victims  —   the early loss of a mother, the ability to focus on visual detail, the obsession with youthful memories, a certain withdrawal from the general adult routine of getting and spending  —   the difference in sex comes to seem unimportant. These victims of the fire are all “isolatos,” to use Herman Melville’s term: They are at odds with the larger society and its patterns. That is how they’ve ended up as single renters in this decrepit, unsafe house. And while their life stories are not all equally compelling  —   I was gripped by the neurosurgeon’s taut moral dilemmas, somewhat bored by the priest’s more meandering ones  —   each is essential to the group portrait. We start to notice the strange overlaps about halfway through the novel, but it is only when we get to the “Traveller” chapter, just before the final one, that we are offered a rationale for them. In the course of journeying through India, this character, a retired, divorced schoolteacher, undergoes a transformative spiritual experience rather like the revelation that descends on the central English figure in E. M. Forster’s “A Passage to India,” or for that matter, in Geoff Dyer’s “Jeff in Venice, Death in Varanasi. ” Thubron’s traveler, when exposed firsthand to the religious practices of the subcontinent, begins to grasp, if only tentatively, the possibility of his unity with everyone and everything else. “If there is no God, what survives death?” he asks a Buddhist monk with whom he is conversing in Sarnath. “’u200a‘Something inherited,’ the monk answered. ‘Something waiting to be perfected.’ His hands unfurled from his chest. ‘But the previous life cannot be found again.’ “’u200a‘It has no memory . ’u2008. ’u2008.’ “’u200a‘’u2009If it has memory, it does not know it. Sometimes a person is reminded after many years, maybe prompted by chance. There are stories . ’u2008. ’u2008. ’’u200a” In his closing remarks to the Englishman, the monk, patting his arm “in encouragement,” observes that from the path of meditation one can never return to a singleness of self: “You’d lose too much! Ha, ha! You’d die back into suffering. We say that life is a burning house. ” This is not so much a clue to the book’s meaning or even its method as it is a life vest thrown to floundering readers. We are not being offered answers here. Instead, we are being soothed with recurring themes and motifs, in the manner of a musical composition. And what are those themes? Among others, the idea that death is the end of the individual but perhaps not the end of everything. The dissolved, burned bodies in the fiery house will become part of the elements that make up the universe, just as the ceremonially burned bodies in the Ganges, as witnessed by the traveling Englishman, become part of the river itself. And the memories that fleetingly pass through each mind in its final moments are both individual and shared, forming a common thread that may not even exist (“It has no memory”) or may exist only on an inaccessible level (“If it has memory, it does not know it”). This is not consolation as we normally know or seek it  —   “Night of Fire” is a coldly contemplative book rather than a comforting one  —   but it is an interesting idea for fiction, which normally depends so heavily on the notion of individual consciousness. Perhaps only Christopher Isherwood, in “A Single Man,” has attempted anything quite like this, and he did it with just a single character, not a multitude of them. I can’t be sure, after a first reading, that I wholeheartedly like Colin Thubron’s novel. But I am absolutely certain that I admire it.	1
355	A judge ruled Friday that one additional woman who says Bill Cosby sexually assaulted her will be permitted to testify at his trial later this year on charges that he sexually assaulted a former Temple University staff member in 2004. Legal experts have said that the account of a second woman describing what she said was an act of sexual assault could strengthen the case against Mr. Cosby, 79, who has denied any misconduct. But the judge’s decision was far from a full victory for prosecutors in Montgomery County, Pa. who had sought to introduce testimony from 13 women who have accused Mr. Cosby of assaulting them. The prosecutors had told Judge Steven T. O’Neill of the Court of Common Pleas that the testimony of the group of women was important in showing a pattern of conduct by Mr. Cosby that bolstered the account of Andrea Constand, the former Temple employee. Judge O’Neill agreed to allow the testimony of the one woman, identified only as “Prior Alleged Victim Six,” in a   decision that briefly discussed his legal reasoning. The judge said that he had considered the evidence, the legal arguments and aimed for “a careful balancing of the probative value of the other acts evidence and the prejudice to the Defendant. ” While the judge’s decision was too brief to completely understand his reasoning, the account given by the woman is similar to that given by Ms. Constand, who says she was drugged and sexually assaulted at the entertainer’s home near Philadelphia. Two years ago, the new witness appeared at a news conference, alongside her lawyer, Gloria Allred, where she was identified only as Kacey and described working as an assistant to Mr. Cosby’s agent at the William Morris Agency in the 1990s. She and Mr. Cosby were friendly, she said, and once had dinner at his home where they both read from a script, their scene ending in a passionate kiss that made her uncomfortable. Then, she said, she went to lunch at his California hotel bungalow in 1996 where, she said, she passed out after he gave her a “large white pill,” and woke up in bed next to Mr. Cosby, who was naked beneath an open robe. “Once Prior Victim Number Six was incapacitated, defendant sexually assaulted her,” prosecutors said in court papers last year. The woman said at the news conference that she never pressed charges because she feared retaliation. Mr. Cosby has denied all the allegations of sexual assault and has described his encounter with Ms. Constand as consensual. His spokesman, Andrew Wyatt, declined to comment on the ruling. Mr. Cosby’s legal team is expected to challenge Ms. Constand’s credibility. Legal experts said the judge’s ruling made that job more difficult, but that the admittance of testimony from multiple women would have been significantly more damaging. “He has two people to challenge rather than just one in that sense, it’s a defeat,” said Dennis McAndrews, a Pennsylvania lawyer and former prosecutor. But, he added: “If five or more had been admitted, it would have been devastating for his case. It is easier to attack the testimony of two. ” Mr. Cosby’s lawyers had fought to block the women’s accounts, which had not been the subject of criminal complaints or adjudicated at trial, and which they disparaged as vague. “There has never been a shred of physical evidence to support such claims, they have never been reported to any authority and today their stories of ‘that night spent partying with a famous celebrity’ are based solely on the tainted, unreliable memories of women, now in their senior years, recalling alleged events from a single encounter from the 1960s, 1970s or 1980s,” his lawyers Brian J. McMonagle and Angela C. Agrusa said in court papers in October. Ordinarily, prosecutors cannot introduce evidence or accusations of prior bad behavior because it is viewed as too prejudicial for a jury as it considers the facts of the single case before it. But in Pennsylvania, as in other states, such evidence is permitted when it shows conduct so similar it can be argued that it demonstrates a common scheme or plan, a kind of unique signature of the defendant. Prosecutors characterized the accounts of the 13 women as being similar to Ms. Constand’s in that the women said Mr. Cosby had befriended or mentored them, gave them a pill or other intoxicant, and that when they awoke hours later, they said, they had been sexually abused. Kevin R. Steele, the Montgomery County District Attorney, on Friday described the judge’s ruling as important, saying, “The jury will now be allowed to assess evidence that is relevant to establishing a common plan, scheme and design of sexual abuse. ” For many of the women, testifying represented a final opportunity to confront Mr. Cosby legally. Most never came forward decades ago, when they say the episodes occurred, and have been unable to bring civil cases against Mr. Cosby because the statutes of limitation have expired. On Friday, Ms. Allred congratulated the 13, seven of whom were at least once her clients, saying, “Even though they will not be able to testify in this case, they have been very important in the effort to seek justice. ” For prosecutors, there is a risk in introducing prior bad acts as evidence. In one recent case where such evidence helped lead to a conviction, the decision was overturned by an appeals court that found the admission of the evidence had, in fact, prejudiced the jury. The case involved a senior official in the Roman Catholic Church in Philadelphia who had been convicted on charges related to failing to stop child sexual abuse by some priests. Isabelle A. Kirshner, a criminal defense lawyer in New York who is not involved in the case, said that by only allowing one of the women in, Judge O’Neill had reduced the chance that any verdict would be reversed on appeal. As for the Cosby team, she said, “I am sure that they are not happy another witness is coming in, but given that they wanted 13, this is a victory for him. ” In December, in another crucial decision, Judge O’Neill ruled that deposition testimony, given by Mr. Cosby in a separate 2005 lawsuit filed by Ms. Constand, could be admitted as evidence in the coming criminal trial. In the deposition, Mr. Cosby admitted to affairs and acknowledged obtaining quaaludes as part of his efforts to have sex with women. Mr. Cosby is seeking a change of venue for the trial, now set for Norristown, Pa. or for jurors to be brought in from another county, arguing that he has been harmed by negative publicity and   media coverage. A hearing on that motion is scheduled for Monday.	1
93	In “A United Kingdom,” David Oyelowo plays Seretse Khama, the   king of Botswana (then a British protectorate known as Bechuanaland) who set off an international crisis in 1948, when he married Ruth Williams, a white British clerk. South Africa, which was instituting apartheid at the time, objected to an interracial couple’s leading a neighboring country Britain opposed the marriage because   South Africa did and Botswanans were angry that their leader had chosen a queen not of their race or tribe. Reviewing “A United Kingdom” for The New York Times, Glenn Kenny said the best reason to see the film was Mr. Oyelowo’s performance and added, “It is remarkable, genuinely riveting work. ” One scene in particular encapsulates the performance: an   meeting at which he must convince his countrymen that he should remain their king and that they should accept his wife. In an interview at The Times, Mr. Oyelowo, who was also a producer of the film, explained how, for this scene, he drew on his own life as well as historical research. Here are edited excerpts from the conversation: How did you think about this scene? For me, things hopefully come together. Obviously you have to know your lines and know them well enough in front of a crowd, [so] you harness their attention. There’s also the accent: Seretse Khama had a Botswana accent, but he also spent a lot of time in the U. K. so his accent was a hybrid. And sometimes the emotion can take over and the technical aspects can go by the wayside, and you don’t want that to happen. Then there’s the truth of what he’s saying, the emotional truth. None of the technical work means anything unless there is an emotional connection  —   for you as the actor but also to the people you’re delivering the speech to and then the audience as well. What was the attitude you started out with when you looked out into the crowd? It was one of those rare instances for me as an actor where what I say as the character very much overlapped with what I believe as a person myself. And so I felt a lot of the emotions I imagine Seretse Khama would have felt. We shot it in Botswana in front of a Botswana crowd, a lot of whom would know who Seretse Khama was. So in some ways, it’s a real test to play this leader who means so much to them and to convince them both within the film and as real people who see me as an actor not from Botswana.  Do you think about posture or other physical things when you’re performing?  I found through my research and watching footage [that Khama] was an incredibly poised man, a very elegant man. And I felt in this speech, there should be a stillness to him. I’ve always felt stillness gives status. And even though he is emotional [throughout] this speech, he never loses his dignity.  When people aren’t engaged in the crowd, how do you get them back? Any actor will tell you this. I’ve done a lot of stage, and you can see how the audience is reacting. Sometimes you have people asleep in the front row. Sometimes people are crying their eyes out. You have to try to find a place within you that doesn’t take it personally. Thankfully, most people seemed engaged, but sometimes people weren’t. And you have to use those people you probably zone in on someone who seems not so interested. In the scene, a single tear falls. How do you make that happen? For me, any emotion I have, it’s not technical. I am not one of those people who can cry on cue. It has to feel real.  Is there anything in your performance as the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in “Selma” that you brought to this role? In many ways, I was desperate to make sure there was a distinction between myself as Dr. King giving a speech and Seretse Khama giving a speech. Of course, these are completely different men, but they have me in common in movies, and I was very mindful that they must remain distinct.	1
109	Mass shootings happen in public spaces and private offices. They happen at places of worship and study, work and play. And increasingly, they happen onstage  —   in fictional tragedies and verbatim dramas that explore the psychology of the shooters and the consequences for the affected individuals and communities. The past several years have seen Jessica Dickey’s “The Amish Project” Stephen Karam and PJ Paparelli’s “columbinus” Simon Stephens’s “Punk Rock” Scott Z. Burns’s “The Library” David Greig’s “The Events” Julia Cho’s “Office Hour” Rajendra Ramoon Maharaj, Adam Mace and Christian Lee Branch’s “Mother Emanuel” and a host of    —   each instigated by one or more instances of gun violence. This month brings three new plays inspired by the 2012 events in Newtown, Conn. in which a man opened fire at Sandy Hook Elementary School, killing 26 children and adults before taking his own life. Eric Ulloa’s “26 Pebbles,” presented by the Human Race Theater Company in Dayton, Ohio, is a documentary drama in the style of Tectonic Theater Project’s “The Laramie Project. ” Mr. Ulloa, an actor turned writer, based the play on the more than 60 interviews he did with Newtown residents. By contrast, Martín Zimmerman’s “On the Exhale” and Courtney Baron’s “When It’s You” use the Newtown catastrophe as a stimulus for anguished fictions. Mr. Zimmerman’s play, which opens on Sunday at the Roundabout Underground, is a monologue voiced by a nameless literature professor who finds herself fixated on a weapon used in a mass shooting. Ms. Baron’s piece, a Keen Company production that begins performances on Feb. 28 and is also a solo show, uses a multiple murder to meditate on what we owe to one another. The New York Times spoke to these writers about representing gun violence onstage and their own experiences with firearms. These are edited excerpts from the conversations. What inspired your play? I was tired of my own complacency whenever something horrific happens that I can’t understand, this being a traumatic one because it was   and   old children. I was tired of doing Facebook posts with my personal comments about how angry I am and sending it into the void. I wanted to see if I could offer anything as a writer. Have you ever shot a gun or had experience with gun violence? I was not raised in a gun house. My dad owned a gun because he was a   manager. I’m pretty common sense on gun control: I believe that people have the right to own a personal handgun for safety if they feel the need to. I don’t feel the need to. There’s a good police force out there that will do it for me. How do you as a playwright handle violence onstage?  We use a very theatrical conceit when the moment happens, it’s an actual giant shattering of glass. I promised every person I interviewed that I would never try to make this a piece of sensationalism. I don’t want to see that. We’re dealing with children, and that’s some touchy ground. That’s not the story I’m trying to tell. Do you think your play will register differently in the Trump era?  I would never thank him for anything. But I’ve got to thank him because the climate he’s created in this country has made this piece relevant. I had students on opening weekend saying, “It made me realize that I want to become an activist. ” This    liberal heart was in heaven. What inspired your play? I knew that nothing legislative was going to happen after Sandy Hook it filled me with such boiling rage. I really just couldn’t imagine how furious you would be if you lost a child like that. That was the seed. Also, I’ve been   fascinated with the contradictions over what it means to operate a weapon, that in order to do it effectively you need to be calm, almost meditative. Have you ever shot a gun or had experience with gun violence? I’ve shot a rifle  —   a   rifle at Boy Scout camp. I have never encountered any gun violence personally in Chicago, where I live. But I have read articles about someone living in my neighborhood, driving a route that I drive all the time and seeing someone get shot in the head. How do you as a playwright handle violence onstage?  I have yet to see realistic violence rendered onstage that didn’t take me out of the experience: I’m so aware that what I’m watching is not real. We do ourselves a disservice when we try to make theater a literal space. It’s always way more effective to enlist an audience’s imagination. When you see weapons onstage, your eyes just go to them. It’s troubling, but they’re really fascinating, seductive, complex machines. If we put them onstage, you’re just going to be waiting for that thing to discharge, waiting for that sound. Do you think your play will register differently in the Trump era? I don’t know if this is still true in the age of Trump, but I would say that   gun control was the issue about which I felt the greatest despair. These objects are so seductive it’s almost impossible to control ourselves around them. Once you have access to this really powerful machine that gives you the illusion of power, it becomes really difficult to imagine yourself separated from it. You have to acknowledge that clearly there is some emotional connection going on, some deep fears and deep longings and deep love. What inspired your play? When Sandy Hook happened, my daughter had just turned 7. I think it woke me up. I grew up in a political family and my dad was very, very wrapped up in politics, but I had never taken on anything on my own. The only way I know how to write is the smallest, most microcosmic way. I had attempted to write something more overtly political, more of a polemic, and it didn’t feel true to me. Have you ever shot a gun or had experience with gun violence? I grew up in Dallas. It wasn’t odd to see gun racks in trucks. I shot rifles at summer camp just like everybody else did. Many of the families in the neighborhood I grew up in had guns. We didn’t think, like, “Oh, there are weapons of murder in our homes. ” They were kind of casually for protection. When I was in college, my girlfriend and I were like, “Well, what happens at a gun show?” So we went to one. And it was kind of spectacular. First of all, there was a bar. And there were guns for ladies, which was the craziest thing to me  —   little, pretty guns specifically for ladies. And the ladies were lined up. How do you as a playwright handle violence onstage?  Violence is more about entertainment than it is about the reality of what happens to people. It’s like sex onstage. It doesn’t work. I studied with Romulus Linney at Columbia, and he was always like: “Don’t put a gun onstage. It’s going to be horrible. ” Do you think your play will register differently in the Trump era?  I think it has to do with personal culpability as a member of society. In light of the election, whatever one’s political bent is, we have to take on social responsibility. I don’t think we should carry the bag of guilt in the heaviest way, but we are culpable. You cannot live in a vacuum. So you have to examine what’s important to you and what you can do about it.	1
145	KHAYELITSHA, South Africa  —   He works in AIDS prevention and his wife gets the occasional gig at a local supermarket. But neither job is regular enough for a “proper home,” Zwai Lugogo says, so his family lives in a shack here in Cape Town’s largest black township, making do with thin walls of painted metal. Many of his neighbors  —   housekeepers, factory workers, nurse’s aides  —   are in the same predicament, working hard at jobs available to black South Africans, but barely scraping by. “That money that we’re getting from work is just not enough to be able to take care of our families,” said Mr. Lugogo, 34, as neighborhood children, including his    son, ran around their narrow street recently. “We need an intervention. ” South Africa is now considering one. Faced with rising discontent over the economy among black voters, the government is weighing something more common in developed economies: a national minimum wage. Late last year, a government panel recommended about $260 a month, or about $1. 50 an hour  —   a small amount even in South Africa, but close to the median income in a country where the official unemployment rate is 27 percent and nearly half the population lives in poverty. Last week, the nation’s deputy president, Cyril Ramaphosa, endorsed the panel’s recommendation, vowing that the minimum wage would be in effect by May 2018. But in such a sluggish economy, opponents contend that the effort would destroy jobs, especially for the least skilled. Supporters counter that a minimum wage is the only way to reduce poverty in one of the world’s most unequal societies, helping to dismantle an   system designed to provide cheap black labor for an economy dominated by the white minority. In few places do divisions run as deep as in South Africa. Wealthy communities with living standards equal to those in the West and inhabited disproportionately by whites rub shoulders uneasily with desperately poor townships. A government survey released in January found that black South Africans, who make up 80 percent of the population, earned only   of what whites did in 2015. Some smaller African economies, like those of Cameroon, Ghana and Ivory Coast, already have a national minimum wage. But only a small percentage of their workers are in the formal economy and therefore eligible for the minimum, experts say. And even for them, the rules tend not to be enforced. A national minimum wage would be more meaningful in a big economy like South Africa’s, experts say, because the formal work force is much larger, around 80 percent of all workers. Millions of people would be eligible. Still, South Africa,   Africa’s most advanced economy, is enduring the same forces as the rest of the continent. It is not growing fast enough to absorb its rapidly growing population, which is leaving rural areas to look for work in places like Khayelitsha, one of the country’s biggest townships with about 400, 000 people. There is added urgency for the government to act: The African National Congress, which helped liberate black South Africans from   rule and has governed the country since 1994, is still stinging from losing most of the nation’s biggest cities in elections last July. The party could once bank on loyal support from the nation’s black majority. But corruption and economic stagnation for millions of people have steadily eroded that support over the years, resulting in the party’s worst showing in elections since the end of apartheid in 1994. The frustrations are evident in Khayelitsha. It is roughly situated between two of South Africa’s richest areas: the city of Cape Town and the famed wine country of Stellenbosch. Established in 1983 by the apartheid government, Khayelitsha, which means new home in Xhosa, still provides many of the workers for both communities. On weekday mornings, soon after daybreak, the men and women of Khayelitsha leave their neighborhoods and walk to the nearest train or bus station. For many, the commute  —   a legacy of   urban planning to separate white and black areas  —   takes up to a couple of hours each way. Many on Mr. Lugogo’s street, known as Twecu Crescent, said their commute cost them a quarter or a third of their monthly wages. For black South Africans nationwide, the cost of taxis, buses and other passenger road transportation accounts for 5. 4 percent of their expenses, compared with 0. 2 percent for whites, who tend to own cars. A bus called the Golden Arrow stopped not far from Twecu Crescent with a few passengers already on board. It made several stops in Khayelitsha and, after passing a densely packed stretch of shanties, some precariously stacked two high, it pulled out of the township on its way toward Cape Town. Headed to residential areas, the bus transported mostly women who worked in malls or in homes as housekeepers. Along the way, in a scene repeated in many buses that morning, a woman, in this instance Julia Xakata, began preaching and leading the others in song. Some sang softly while checking their cellphones. Sitting near the front of the bus next to a window, Makatiso Sekhamane moved her lips while knitting a black cap. “I knit whenever I have some free time,” Ms. Sekhamane, 47, said, explaining that she usually completed a cap in two days and sold it for about $4. “It’s something. ” The caps supplemented the $400 a month she made working six days a week cleaning white people’s homes. Her husband earned maybe $150 repairing refrigerators. Their combined income supports five children and two grandchildren at home. Much of the discussion surrounding a national minimum wage  —   led by government, business, labor and academics  —   is expected to focus on the amount. According to the panel’s report, a monthly minimum wage of about $260 “would maximize benefits to the poor and minimize any possible” disincentives to work. The amount proposed by the panel is below the working poverty line of $325 a month, but because the median income of South African workers is only $280 a month, the minimum would help reduce inequality, the panel said. On Twecu Crescent, many of the employed already earn the proposed minimum, or more. But their wages are far below the salaries earned by the few residents in the nicest homes  —   $600 a month for a government worker, $900 a month for a young police officer. The proposed minimum “is not enough,” said Nombeko Mndangaso, who earns about $165 a month working five hours a day as a cleaner in a nursing home. “It won’t make a difference. ” With her husband, who makes $245 a month as a   security guard, they earn more than $400 a month. But with rent, transportation, electricity and two daughters, there is little left at the end of the month. A minimum wage of “at least” $340 a month per person, she said, would improve her family’s situation. Sparsely populated a generation ago, Twecu Crescent now has little or no space between homes. Many homeowners earn extra income by renting out shacks on their property to the endless stream of new arrivals to Khayelitsha. On Twecu Crescent, a short street divided into two blocks, the handful of sturdily built homes belonging to the upwardly mobile stand out. There is, in a   house, the woman who works at a bank down the street, the man employed by the government power utility and, on the corner, the police officer whose still unfinished house has a new red Peugeot in the driveway and a low wall with spikes to discourage people from sitting on it. The street is otherwise lined with more modest homes under corrugated roof sheets, inhabited by those making a third or half of what those in the nicer homes do, and shacks of varying quality occupied by those worse off. Discolored concrete blocks are neatly piled in many front yards, a sign of the slow and unsteady pace of progress for most on Twecu Crescent. Sinovuyo Gada’s family moved here in 1998. “There was no road here, just gravel,” she said. “There were no houses, just shacks. ” Her father, a welder, and her mother, who sells homemade food from a shack in their front yard, built the house in which she and her brother grew up. After finishing high school in 2012, she sent out her résumé to countless companies for three years before finally securing a   job through a friend. She now works four days a week at a supermarket at a mall in Cape Town, earning $60 a week. About 30 percent of that, or $18, goes to transportation. Ms. Gada, 22, is part of the “ ” generation of black South Africans who came of age after apartheid’s fall. But like many in her cohort, she was deeply dissatisfied with the pace of change in her family’s circumstances. “The apartheid, it’s still there,” she said. The wages she earned from the job that took so long in finding would do little to improve her situation, she said. She did not believe that a monthly minimum of $260 would help. Employers control the balance of power over people like her, she said. “They think sometimes we are desperate,” she said. “Yes, we are desperate, because we have families and children to take care of. ” It was early evening, and, all over Khayelitsha, men and women started coming home, most of them walking from bus stops to their streets, their gait slower than in the morning. On Twecu Crescent, girls sat on a corner playing a game of rocks. A boy pushing an old tire with a stick cast a long shadow up the street. The woman who was knitting on the bus, Ms. Sekhamane  —   better known on Twecu Crescent as Mama Kakiso, or the mother of Kakiso, her son  —   arrived home. She had had a busy day and, arriving late at the bus stop, had found no available seats on the Golden Arrow. She took a taxi instead, paying an amount equivalent to half the price of one of her black caps. “I’m going to wash my body and sleep now,” Mama Kakiso said as she slipped into her home. “I can’t do anything. ”	1
797	 Did Pope Benedict say that the Bible and the Q’ran are the same? True or false? On Monday the Bishop Of Rome addressed Catholic followers regarding the dire importance of exhibiting religious tolerance. During his hour-long speech, a smiling Pope Francis was quoted telling the Vatican’s guests that the Koran, and the spiritual teachings contained therein, are just as valid as the Holy Bible.“Jesus Christ, Jehovah, Allah. These are all names employed to describe an entity that is distinctly the same across the world. For centuries, blood has been needlessly shed because of the desire to segregate our faiths. This, however, should be the very concept which unites us as people, as nations, and as a world bound by faith. Together, we can bring about an unprecedented age of peace, all we need to achieve such a state is respect each others beliefs, for we are all children of God regardless of the name we choose to address him by. We can accomplish miraculous things in the world by merging our faiths, and the time for such a movement is now. No longer shall we slaughter our neighbors over differences in reference to their God.”   On Wednesday the Bishop Of Rome addressed 11,000 ticketed guests on the South Lawn of the White House, during which he pontificated on the dire importance of exhibiting religious tolerance. During his hour-long speech, a smiling Pope Francis was quoted telling the White House guests that the Koran, and the spiritual teachings contained therein, are just as valid as the Holy Bible, and should therefore be respected as such.	0
470	In a fiery reminder of its presence and its power, Mount Etna roared to life this week on the island of Sicily, sending   fountains of molten rock and ash high into the air and down the slopes of Europe’s largest and most active volcano. The latest eruption, which began on Monday and is expected to last at least several more days, could be seen for miles. Mount Etna’s frequent eruptions have been watched and feared for thousands of years. An especially large one in the 17th century changed the shape of Sicily’s coastline with a huge outpouring of lava. More recent outbursts have tended to be smaller, but still dangerous enough to prompt evacuations of nearby villages and disrupt air traffic with plumes of smoke and ash. By Tuesday, Italian authorities said the latest eruption posed no further danger to the towns that dot the mountain’s slopes, and flights in and out of the closest airport in Catania were operating normally again. A big eruption in 1981 destroyed 12, 350 acres of vineyards and woods, as well as scores of rural homes and vacation villas. Lava flows cut telephone and power lines, buried railroad tracks and blocked highways. Tremors from a 2002 eruption led to the evacuation of 1, 000 people. The   volcano has nurtured the island’s residents more than it has threatened them. Its eruptions have give northeastern Sicily a   soil that is prized by farmers and vintners, and the mountain draws many tourists.	1
906	 Did the Hamptons police department get a decommissioned submarine? Sounds shady to me, but can’t find any info if it is a joke or not. “I want to emphasize that this submersible craft came at no cost to taxpayers,” Hamptons PD representative Larry Hirsch explains in a press release. “With the blessing of the Hamptons Municipal Board, we requested such a watercraft last year under a federal program to outfit local police departments with surplus military equipment.” “While the craft reached the end of its usefulness for the U.S. Navy, the civilian applications of this submersible are numerous,” Hirsch says in the statement. “You never know what’s out there and we’re here to protect the citizenry from the worst case scenario,” he added in a phone call Tuesday. “Imagine the horror people would experience if a large military craft passed beneath their boat or emerged from depths within view of the beach — we’re here to stop that from happening. This sub will make a strong statement about our power and might,” Hirsch continued. “The people want to know their police will do whatever it takes — whatever it takes — to maintain order and control,” he said. “They want to see us as an unstoppable force beyond the reach of sleazy criminals’ lawyers and legal loopholes.” “It was terrifying,” the boat’s captain, Clint Bartholomew, said after his arraignment Friday morning. “Everything went dark as this huge, black shape emerged from the depths, and next thing you know, this dude is yelling at us through some kind of loudspeaker and waving his arms so I can see him up in that tower thing,” the captain said, adding, “I have to say, it was pretty cool riding back in that thing, especially being totally baked as I was, but I’ll definitely be following my boating Ps and Qs while that thing is out there.”	0

459	Good morning.  Here’s what you need to know: • Reaction to President Trump’s address tended to focus on its “presidential” style. His sobriety, seriousness of purpose, and calls for unity reassured  —   and surprised  —   many listeners. “I think it sounded great, like a utopia,” one voter said, adding, “I don’t think it’s that simple. ” Indeed, Mr. Trump, who met with congressional Republican leaders on Wednesday, above, faces not only a committed Democratic opposition but a divided Republican Party. Today’s episode of The Daily podcast examines the president’s speech, especially his promises to protect Americans.

S. another unintended clash among the myriad forces on the fluid battlefield. Separately, United Nations investigators released a report detailing war crimes committed by various forces in the Syrian conflict. The Syrian government’s deliberate bombing of a U. N. aid convoy in September, which killed 14 aid workers, was “one of the most egregious. ” Also in Syria, a senior Qaeda leader who was a    of Osama bin Laden was killed Sunday in a U. S. drone strike. _____ • The Malaysian investigation into the Feb. 13 assassination of Kim   the half brother of North Korea’s leader, has been halted at the doors to the North Korean Embassy in Kuala Lumpur.

Some researchers identify them as bacterial remains that offer evidence that life emerged not long, geologically speaking, after the birth of the planet 4. 5 billion years ago. Others are, in the words of one scientist, “frankly dubious. ” Such battles, an optimist observed, are ”how science progresses. ” • Snap Inc.

When the movie “King Kong” was first screened, 84 years ago today in New York City, it was widely anticipated for its technological feats and a challenging narrative that had a “monstrous ape 50 feet tall” climbing the   Empire State Building. “The film will show prehistoric monsters fighting one another and making weird sounds,” The Times reported before the release, calling it a “fantastic film. ” It also helped define the career of Bruce Cabot, who played Jack Driscoll, the hero who rescues Fay Wray from the giant ape. Mr. Cabot’s career didn’t start in acting school. At 14, he scavenged cattle remains on the prairies of New Mexico for bone meal. Work in construction “gave him a democratic outlook on life,” The Times wrote in 1933. As a ship deckhand, he worked his way to Europe and meandered through   War I France and Spain. After “King Kong,” a series of supporting roles followed, often alongside John Wayne. World War II military service took him back to Europe, where he worked in intelligence. That may have prepared him for one of his last roles: Fighting a fictitious spy named James Bond in “Diamonds Are Forever. ” Patrick Boehler contributed reporting. _____ Your Morning Briefing is published weekday mornings and updated online.

375	ONTARIO, Ore.  —   When Representative Greg Walden of Oregon visits his expansive district, which swallows   of a very blue West Coast state, his constituents grouse amiably to their longtime Republican congressman about environmental regulations and federal lands policy. And then the conversation shifts to the Affordable Care Act and what its repeal would mean for the struggling rural workers who have long voted for Mr. Walden, and for children like    Rocco Stone. Because of the health law, Rocco has been able to live at home, attend school and have a nearly normal life despite having autism and a rare genetic disorder. “Our life was completely changed when Oregon and the federal government partnered to provide home and community services through Medicaid,” Rocco’s mother, Dana M. Stone, told the congressman this past week. “We are deeply, deeply concerned about talk at the federal level about a complete repeal of the Affordable Care Act. ” Mr. Walden, the new chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, is not just another backbench Republican dealing with suddenly energized supporters of the health law at town   meetings. The lanky    congressman will have a large role in drafting promised legislation to replace former President Barack Obama’s signature domestic achievement and a huge say in decisions about the future of Medicaid, which the health law greatly expanded. As a former chairman of the committee responsible for electing Republicans to the House, Mr. Walden knows the politics of health care as well as anyone. But in his new role, he must reconcile the political goals of his party, which is committed to repealing the 2010 health law, and the interests of his state, where officials say the law has been a big success. In 2010, nearly one in five Oregonians lacked health coverage. Today, state officials say, 95 percent of Oregonians have coverage. Since Oregon expanded eligibility for Medicaid under the health law in 2014, enrollment has increased more than 65 percent. Nearly   of the state’s four million residents are now on Medicaid. In Mr. Walden’s district, the percentages are even higher. In some of his rural counties, more than   of the people are on Medicaid. President Trump easily carried those counties. Mr. Walden won a 10th term in the fall with 72 percent of the vote and was victorious in every one of the 20 counties in his district, which is about the size of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut combined. But that does not guarantee that voters here endorse all the policies of his party. Hospitals are among the leading supporters and beneficiaries of Affordable Care Act. Mr. Walden was a trustee of a   hospital in his hometown, Hood River. “We are very worried about what ‘repeal and replace’ might look like,” said David Underriner, who supervises the hospital, Providence Hood River Memorial, as Oregon’s regional chief executive for Providence Health and Services, the large Roman Catholic system that owns it. Mr. Walden grew up on a cherry orchard, worked at radio stations owned by his family, and followed his father into the State Legislature. The political shifts that have turned all three Pacific Coast states reliably Democratic have begun to creep into a few of the conservative inland parts of Oregon. Hood River County, long known for fruit farming, windsurfing and the spectacular scenery of the Columbia River Gorge, has lately become a center for the production of surveillance drones, leading to an influx of software engineers, technology entrepreneurs and other young professionals. Mr. Walden’s margin of victory in November in the county where he lives was just five votes  —   out of more than 10, 590 cast. “It’s just a little ” Mr. Walden allowed. “It didn’t used to be that way. ” Unlike many Republicans in Congress, Mr. Walden has worked productively with Democrats. “I’m a problem solver,” he said in an interview after a town   meeting here near the Idaho border. “I’m not an ideologue. I want to fix things. ” And in Oregon, some Democrats and   supporters are glad Mr. Walden is in his position. “I’ve known Greg a long time,” said Andrew S. Davidson, the president and chief executive of the Oregon Association of Hospitals and Health Systems. “He is not interested in upending the progress we have made in this state. ” Representative Kurt Schrader, a Democrat whose district includes the southern suburbs of Portland and the capital, Salem, predicted Mr. Walden “will be mindful of the implications of any legislation for our state, which is leading the nation in the transformation of health care. ” Unlike Mr. Walden, Oregon has embraced the Affordable Care Act. State officials say many of the changes proposed by congressional Republicans, including a rollback of federal funds for the expansion of Medicaid, would reverse much of the progress they have made. Oregon has a history of health care innovation that predates the Affordable Care Act. In the early 1990s, it ranked medical procedures according to their costs and benefits, and Medicaid uses this list to decide which services to cover. Under a federal waiver granted in 2012, Oregon treats Medicaid beneficiaries through 16 “coordinated care organizations,” which are governed by local citizen councils. The organizations have slowed the growth of health spending and improved the health of Medicaid beneficiaries, according to performance data collected by the state. Even as he writes legislation to unwind the Affordable Care Act, Mr. Walden takes pride in Oregon’s success under the law. “Our state of Oregon has had quite a bit of innovation over the years,” Mr. Walden said. “We’ve got the coordinated care organizations in place that have actually brought better health care outcomes at lower cost. There are great ideas out there among the states, but right now, they have to come back and beg permission from a federal bureaucrat to be able to do much of anything innovative. ” When Mr. Walden first ran for Congress in 1998, conservatives called him too liberal. Since then, he has taken more conservative positions, and the party has moved to the right. “Times change,” he said. “You get a terrorist attack. You have different administrations come and go. Culture changes. My bedrock principles have stayed the same. I favor more local   and less Washington  . ” Mr. Walden never wavered in his opposition to the Affordable Care Act. On the day the House passed the bill in March 2010, he and other Republicans stood on the Capitol balcony, before a throng of protesters, and held up signs with handwritten letters that spelled out their message: “Kill the Bill. ” A month later, on the House floor, Mr. Walden announced the goal that he hopes soon to achieve, using words that became the mantra for Republicans: “We need to repeal and replace this law. ” Over the last four years, Mr. Walden has been a genial attack dog for Republicans. As chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, he averted a political blood bath for his party and secured the election of Republicans in many districts that voted for Hillary Clinton in the presidential election. Many of those House campaigns revolved around attacks on the health law that he is now charged with replacing. Oregon tried to run its own health insurance exchange, but had a disastrous experience and decided, after a year, to use the federal website, HealthCare. gov. The state has a competitive insurance market, but consumers have still seen substantial increases in prices, with the average premium for a popular benchmark plan on the exchange rising 27 percent this year and more than 20 percent last year, according to the federal government. (Subsidies cushion the impact for most consumers.) “Medicaid did better than expected, and subsidized commercial insurance did worse,” said Dennis E. Burke, the president of the Good Shepherd Health Care System in Hermiston, Ore. “We have seen steep increases in premiums for commercial insurers, and as a result healthy people have dropped out. ” People newly covered under the health law “proudly present an insurance card,” Mr. Burke said, but in many cases their plans have high deductibles, and the hospital has difficulty collecting the patient’s share of the bill. But Mr. Burke is not so quick as his congressman, Mr. Walden, to seek repeal. “I think it could be fixed,” Mr. Burke said. “We need more of a retooling. ”	1

411	In a settlement that could help thousands of families avoid eviction, New York State will substantially increase the monthly rent subsidies it provides to   families with children in New York City, a move that could help reduce the number of people in homeless shelters. The public assistance program, known as the Family Eviction Prevention Supplement, has remained flat since it was established in 2004, even as rents have skyrocketed. Under the settlement, a family of three eligible for $850 per month, for example, would now be eligible for $1, 515, a 78 percent increase. The increase, which could go into effect as early as April, was agreed to on Monday and settled a lawsuit filed in December 2015 by four single mothers  —   two in the Bronx, one on Staten Island and one in Manhattan. The women said they faced eviction because the monthly public assistance they received from the state was “grossly inadequate” and far below   rent. In 2015,   rent was $1, 571 for a   apartment, and it is now $1, 637. Represented by the Legal Aid Society and Hughes Hubbard  Reed, the women were seeking increases in the Family Eviction Prevention Supplement for families with children who are under the threat of eviction and another benefit, known as the “shelter allowance,” for families with children on public assistance. “I feel happy that it’s going to help other women with children,” said Daniela Tejada, 27, one of the plaintiffs, who lives in a   apartment in the Bronx with her daughters, ages 6 and 2. “It’s really hard out here. All these rents are superhigh. ” The settlement stops short of increasing the basic shelter allowance, which is $400 for a family of three, but focuses on families in imminent danger of losing their housing by greatly increasing the subsidies and expanding eligibility for the program. The program is currently restricted to families with minor children who have been sued by a landlord. Now, victims of domestic violence will be included, even if they are not in court. The new eviction prevention subsidy will put a “substantial dent” in homelessness, Kenneth R. Stephens, a supervising lawyer with the Legal Aid Society, said in an interview. “It is probably the first real positive proposal on a scale that’s consistent with the crisis that we’re facing,” he said. New York City, the most populous city in the United States, has the largest number of homeless people, though most are sheltered. As of last Tuesday, there were 60, 061 people living in shelters overseen by the city’s Department of Homeless Services. That number does not count thousands of other people staying in specialized shelters overseen by other agencies for domestic violence victims and young people. About 51, 000 people were in homeless shelters when Mayor Bill de Blasio took office in 2014. The surge in homelessness has been nearly intractable for the de Blasio administration, which has struggled to find additional shelter and often uses commercial hotels as an expensive stopgap. Mr. de Blasio is expected on Tuesday to unveil a plan to open more shelters so that the city can move people from hotels and eventually transition them to permanent housing. Steven Banks, the former attorney in chief of the Legal Aid Society and the commissioner of the Department of Social Services, has pointed to the outdated rental assistance program as one of the drivers of the city’s ballooning homeless population. In an effort to move people out of shelters and to prevent others from being evicted, the city has put in place an array of rental assistance programs, including its own Family Eviction Prevention Supplement. But that program has confused tenants and landlords since the eligibility, caps and amounts differ from the state’s. Under the settlement, the state and city programs will be consolidated. There are about 10, 000 families in the state program and an additional 1, 000 in the city program, according to the Legal Aid Society. The settlement will be converted to a class action to cover those families and others, though three of the initial plaintiffs no longer receive public assistance and will not benefit. Ms. Tejada will see a bump in her subsidy, which is now limited to $850. Her   apartment rents for $1, 050, which was lowered from $1, 300, after she fought her landlord in housing court. Currently unemployed, Ms. Tejada, who had worked in a dental office, cobbled together the rent with the Family Eviction Prevention Supplement and child support. “Before, everything would go to the rent,” she said. “Now, at least, I can save and pay for school. ” Ms. Tejada said she would like to become a sonographer. This month, Mr. de Blasio and Melissa   the City Council speaker, announced that the city would double  —   to $93 million  —   the funds allocated to help tenants fight landlords in court. “This settlement, combined with adding access to counsel, is really going to be a game changer,” said Judith Goldiner, a lawyer with Legal Aid. Tenants can win in court, but they still need to pay the rent. “A lawyer can’t keep you in your home without the benefits to keep you in your home,” she said.	1

91	DETROIT  —   There are many reasons for the steady success of the three major American automakers in recent years, but none are bigger than the surging sales of   pickup trucks. General Motors, Ford Motor and Fiat Chrysler dominate the segment in the United States market, and they rely on pickups for a sizable portion of their earnings in North America as a whole. But President Trump’s proposed border tax on imported vehicles could throw a wrench in the profit machine, particularly for G. M. and Fiat Chrysler, which build a large percentage of their pickups in Mexico. At the same time, Ford  —   which makes all of its pickups in American factories  —   would most likely benefit at the expense of its rivals. The Trump administration has pledged to levy tariffs of up to 35 percent on vehicles imported from Mexico and possibly elsewhere, primarily to prod automakers to increase production and jobs in the United States. In response, all three of the Detroit companies have announced plans for new investments in their American operations. Ford went a step further by canceling plans to build a $1. 6 billion plant in Mexico that had been criticized repeatedly by Mr. Trump. Yet the possibility of tariffs on trucks overshadows the    so far between a new president determined to expand the American economy and automakers that count on pickups as a huge source of income. “There is an awful lot at stake with a border tax on trucks,” said Michelle Krebs, an analyst with Autotrader. com, a   site. “These are the cash cows for Detroit. ” Pickup sales have been an important component of the consistent growth of the American auto market, which last year set a record with nearly 17. 5 million vehicles sold. The combination of low gas prices and a need by businesses to replace older trucks has stimulated demand, especially for   pickups, more than 90 percent of which are made by the three Detroit companies. In January, the three   vehicles in the nation were pickups: the Ford   G. M.’s Chevrolet Silverado, and Fiat Chrysler’s Ram model. The companies earn an estimated $8, 000 to $10, 000 in profit on each truck sold  —   compared with $3, 000 on a passenger car  —   so Detroit’s financial fortunes inevitably rise and fall on the success of their truck products. Yet for G. M. and Fiat Chrysler, much of that success is dependent on truck production in Mexico, where labor costs are significantly lower than in unionized factories in the United States. Industry analysts estimate that   of G. M.’s annual pickup production comes from its sprawling assembly plant in Silao, Mexico. And while Fiat Chrysler is expanding its American output of trucks, it still relies on its factory in Saltillo, Mexico, for 30 to 40 percent of its pickups, the analysts say. Ford, by contrast, makes its pickups at three plants in the United States. Automakers do not reveal profit margins on particular vehicles. But companies pay workers less than $10 an hour in Mexico, versus the top union wage of $29 in American plants. That differential makes Mexican trucks more profitable for G. M. and Fiat Chrysler than those produced in the United States. There are other costs associated with Mexican production, including shipping vehicles by rail or   to American dealerships. But lower labor rates still make Mexico an attractive production option for automakers. A border tax would wipe out that cost advantage, and could prompt manufacturers to raise prices on   vehicles. “Automakers could possibly eat the cost of a 5 to 10 percent tariff, but not a tax of 20 or 30 percent,” said Ron Harbour, an automotive analyst with the consulting firm Oliver Wyman. “They would probably have to pass some of that on to consumers. ” Higher prices could cool demand for pickups made by G. M. and Fiat Chrysler. The companies could also try to make up the cost of a border tax by spreading price increases across the breadth of their product lineups. While it is not uncommon to reallocate production among factories  —   for example, to make more   trucks in American plants and shift less profitable small cars to Mexico  —   it is expensive and   to do so. G. M. is also vulnerable to potential tariffs on imported parts for pickups made in its factories in Flint, Mich. and Fort Wayne, Ind. About 38 percent of the parts for all G. M. pickups are made in the United States and Canada, and 55 percent are produced in Mexico, according to statistics compiled by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. About 56 percent of the parts in Fiat Chrysler’s pickups are made in the United States and Canada, and 29 percent are produced in Mexico. At Ford, about 70 percent of its pickup components are made in the United States and Canada, and 15 percent come from Mexico. For all three automakers, that mix of parts applies whether the truck is made in the United States or Mexico. It is not clear whether Mr. Trump’s vision of a border tax would apply to parts or only finished products. One industry analyst, Colin Langan of UBS Securities, singled out G. M. in a recent research report for its vulnerability to a tariff on pickups. “The border tax is a clear risk to G. M.’s   pickup trucks,” Mr. Langan wrote. “The timing is also challenging as G. M. plans to retool its pickup facilities ahead of the 2018 pickup launch. ” G. M. executives declined to talk about the impact of a tariff on the company’s pickups during a conference call with analysts last week on its 2016 earnings. The company’s chief financial officer, Chuck Stevens, said it was premature to discuss the implications of a border tax. “There are a lot of moving parts,” he said. “We want to work with the administration to make sure what is best for the U. S. economy. ” G. M.’s chief executive, Mary Barra, stressed that about 80 percent of the products that the company sells in the United States are  . As a member of Mr. Trump’s business advisory council, Ms. Barra said, she has outlined how difficult it is for an automaker to adjust production strategy on the fly. “I think that understanding has been well received,” she said of meeting with the president and his advisers. Other vehicles made in Mexico, such as Ford’s Fusion sedan and G. M.’s Cadillac SRX sport utility vehicle, could also be affected by a border tax. But because of their popularity and profits, pickups are the most vulnerable products. “A tariff on pickups would be a real challenge, especially for G. M.,” said Ms. Krebs of Autotrader. “Trucks are so important to their bottom line, and this is uncharted territory. ”	1
468	They are microscopic artwork: tiny tubes and long filaments, strange squiggles etched into some of the most ancient rocks known. On Wednesday, researchers reported that these may be the oldest fossils ever discovered, the remains of bacteria thriving on Earth not long, geologically speaking, after the very birth of the planet. If so, they offer evidence that life here got off to a very early start. But many experts in the field were skeptical of the new study  —   or downright unconvinced. Martin J. Van Kranendonk, a geologist at the University of New South Wales, called the patterns in the rocks “dubiofossils”  —     structures, perhaps, but without clear proof that they started out as something alive. Heated disputes are nothing new in the search for the earliest life on Earth. In 1993 J. William Schopf, a paleontologist at the University of California, Los Angeles, and his colleagues found what that they, too, argued were the world’s oldest fossils: chainlike blobs in 3. 46    rocks made, they said, by bacteria. Other researchers later argued that the structures were just oddly shaped minerals. But additional specimens from other sites came to light over the past two decades, and many of them have withstood scrutiny. There is now solid evidence of life dating back about 3. 5 billion years. Earth was a billion years old by then, and scientists have long wondered if even older fossils might be found. In August, Dr. Van Kranendonk and his colleagues reported discovering fossils in Greenland dating back 3. 7 billion years. The scientists argued that the organisms were once mats of bacteria that grew in shallow coastal waters. In the new study, published in the journal Nature, Mattew S. Dodd, Dominic Papineau and their colleagues at University College London studied rocks that were either slightly older or much older than those containing the Greenland fossils. They came from a remote geological formation in Canada called Nuvvuagittuq, which stretches across four square miles on the coast of Hudson Bay. Geologists surveyed the formation for the first time in the 1990s. Researchers have variously estimated its age at 3. 77 billion years or 4. 22 billion years  —   just 340 million years after the formation of the planet. In 2008, Dr. Papineau collected rocks from the formation and found a number of clues indicating that they had formed around hydrothermal vents on the ancient sea floor that spewed iron and other minerals. He also found hints that there might have been life there  —   tiny blobs of rock, for instance, that contained a compound called apatite, which can form from phosphorus released by dying organisms. The tubes and other structures in the rock that Mr. Dodd found are also reminiscent of bacteria that live today around hydrothermal vents. They grow as filaments, feeding on iron compounds and creating   cavities in the sediment. Similar filaments contain iron compounds in the Nuvvuagittuq rocks, Mr. Dodd and his colleagues found, and they are attached to round clumps that resemble the tiny anchors bacteria use to hold on to rock surfaces. The rocks also contain forms of organic carbon that could have been created by bacteria. The researchers argue that it would be unlikely for all of these features to have formed in the absence of life. “Then you’re left with one scenario  —   a biological origin,” Mr. Dodd said. Such a discovery could have big implications for the understanding of life’s early evolution. If these really are fossils 3. 77 billion years old, then they show that life was already diversifying by that time, thriving in both the shallow ocean in what is now Greenland and the deep ocean in today’s Canada. And if these are fossils 4. 2 billion years old, then scientists will have evidence that life began quickly on Earth, not long after the oceans formed. Yet Frances Westall, the director of research at the   de Biophysique Moléculaire in Orléans, France, isn’t convinced these are fossils at all. “I am frankly dubious,” she said. For one thing, she has argued, the filaments in the Nuvvuagittuq rocks are too big. She and her colleagues have found filaments formed by bacteria in rock dating back 3. 3 billion years, and these are far smaller. On the early Earth, bacteria were forced to stay small, Dr. Westall said, because the atmosphere did not yet have enough oxygen to fuel their growth. Long after the Nuvvuagittuq rocks formed on the sea floor, they were heated to tremendous temperatures. Some experts doubted that microscopic fossils could have survived such a baking. “These authors built their research on pushing speculative ideas and appear totally unaware of the considerable evidence against their interpretation,” said Wouter Bleeker, of the Geological Survey of Canada. In response, Dr. Papineau observed that the type of rock studied, known as chert, is very hard and might have protected fossils from high temperatures. “I think the authors have done a good job,” said David Wacey, who researches the origins and evolution of life at the University of Western Australia. With the new evidence, he said, “One comes up with a pretty convincing biological scenario” for the origins of the mysterious rock features. Dr. Wacey was not surprised that the new work had drawn criticism. “It may be many years before a consensus is reached,” he said. “But this is how science progresses. ”	1
251	QUITO, Ecuador  —   For most of Luis García’s adult life, a single name dominated the politics of this tiny Andean country: Rafael Correa, the leftist leader of Ecuador’s   citizens’ revolution. But when Mr. García went to the polls Sunday, Mr. Correa was not on the ballot. Unsatisfied with the options that remained, Mr. García, a    musician who first voted for Mr. Correa in 2006, chose to simply scribble over his ballot, rendering it invalid. “I don’t feel represented now,” he said. That feeling of malaise among the left has been spreading throughout Latin America as, one by one, a generation of iconic leaders has departed the stage, brought down by death, elections, impeachment or, in Mr. Correa’s case, term limits. They were known by many names, including the New Left, and ruled the length of the continent with big promises and bigger personalities. Picking up the mantle of the revolutions for which the region became famous in the 1960s and 1970s, these leaders expanded education, increased subsidies for the poor and built roads, highways and hospitals. But they often ran roughshod over those who tried to check their power, from judges to international lenders. And now, nearly all are gone. Hugo Chávez, Venezuela’s fiery leader, died of cancer in 2013, leaving behind a far less popular successor, Nicolás Maduro. The country spiraled into economic collapse as oil prices fell and the country elected the opposition to its National Assembly in 2015. Mr. Maduro dug in, tightening his grip with increasing repression. In Argentina in 2015, voters elected a   businessman to replace a populist, Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, whose programs were popular with the poor and working class. The following year in Brazil, the leftist Dilma Rousseff was ousted through  impeachment. Her Workers’ Party now faces numerous corruption allegations, while Ms. Kirchner is defending herself against an indictment on financial charges. Then, November brought the death of the   of the region’s left: Fidel Castro of Cuba. “These are not isolated events it is a great reversal,” said Gabriela Rivadeneira, the president of Ecuador’s National Assembly, controlled by Mr. Correa’s Alianza País party, which for years   his reforms with few questions asked. “We are now the place that the region is looking at for what comes next. ” Mr. Correa was a    and often contradictory figure, an   economist who regularly flipped between the mold of a fiery populist and the pragmatism of a studied technocrat. By most accounts, poverty and inequality decreased in Ecuador as Mr. Correa funneled oil revenue into everything from raising the salaries of teachers to rebuilding the country’s highways and expanding clinics into the Amazon region. It helped that the price of oil was more than $100 per barrel for some of his tenure. Wealth flowed into the capital, Quito, whose streets bustle with new cars and S. U. V.s as workers dig a vast new metro system below. Mr. Correa also pulled his tiny country onto the international stage, echoing Mr. Castro from an earlier time by railing against capitalism and globalization. In 2012, he granted Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, protection at the Ecuadorean Embassy in London, a thumb in the eye of the United States. Mr. Assange remains there today. But whether Ecuador’s leftist agenda will continue when Mr. Correa leaves office is unclear. There is the question of oil revenue, for one. As in Argentina, Venezuela and Brazil, the social programs in Ecuador that lifted millions out of poverty were underwritten by a commodities boom that sputtered out years ago. Government revenue, around $25 billion a year when oil prices spiked, has now shrunk to less than half that, $11 billion, mainly because of the declining price of oil. That has left the country heavily indebted to China. Ecuador’s economy ground to a halt last year after growing, on average, 4 percent or more from 2006 to 2014. “The model has reached its end because the money has run out,” said César Robalino, a conservative banker at the Pichincha College of Economists in Quito. Mr. Robalino said Ecuador’s next president, regardless of political affiliation, would need to take a tougher line on spending, reduce the number of government workers and cut subsidies like the ones used to reduce gas prices for all Ecuadoreans. That is the stance championed by the conservative opposition candidate Guillermo Lasso, a wealthy banker from Mr. Correa’s hometown, Guayaquil, who finished second in the last election against him in 2013. Mr. Lasso is promising to roll back public spending while eliminating more than a dozen taxes, which would mean the loss of billions of dollars from state coffers. “What a government should do is facilitate entrepreneurship,” Mr. Lasso said in a TV interview during the campaign, adding that he thought Mr. Correa generated too much employment through   jobs. Lenin Moreno, the leading   candidate, has promised to do more with less, borrowing when necessary. In a response to written questions, Mr. Moreno said that despite the collapse of oil prices, Mr. Correa had avoided cutting social programs and gas subsidies used by the poor. Mr. Moreno said he would continue that policy if the left won. With about 80 percent of ballots counted on Sunday night, Mr. Moreno, 63, a former deputy of Mr. Correa, was leading with 38. 8 percent, just more than a point short of the threshold needed to avoid a second round in April. Analysts said that if the numbers held, they would create an opening for Mr. Lasso, who was in second place, to unite his and the remaining opposition votes and potentially capture the presidency. If Mr. Moreno wins, he will face the challenge of setting himself apart from his predecessor and his legacy. Mr. Correa has said he will move to Belgium after his term ends, but some argue that if the left remains in power, Mr. Correa will try to influence politics from behind the scenes. “‘I command, I direct,’ is how he thinks,” said Jorge León, a political scientist at the Central University of Ecuador. Mr. León pointed to an authoritarian streak in Mr. Correa that also became a hallmark of leftists in several other South American countries. After changing the Constitution  —   a move that allowed him to be   twice  —   the president proposed allowing himself to run for a fourth time. (He backtracked when it became clear that popular opinion was against him.) Mr. Correa also tried to make life difficult for his critics during his time in office. He sued journalists, toughened defamation laws and even took over TV channels whose owners criticized him. More recently, he tried to close an environmental group that was stirring up opposition to a planned copper mine in the Amazon. It will be up to Mr. Correa’s successor to decide whether to build on his legacy or reverse it. But those who have tried to forge a different path in the region have faced troubles. President Mauricio Macri of Argentina, despite his vow to revive the country’s economy with   policies, has had trouble attracting investment to his country, noted Franklin Ramírez, a professor at the Latin American Social Sciences Institute in Quito. Brazil’s president, Michel Temer, has been dogged by corruption allegations similar to those that brought down leftists. “It’s a little early to speak of the end of a cycle here” for the left, Mr. Ramírez said. “The hegemony of the left has ended,” he said, but added that it was not clear what would replace it.	1
488	WASHINGTON  —   The iconic blossoming cherry trees that ring the Tidal Basin here have symbolized the arrival of spring for nearly a century. This year, they will be one more sign of wacky and warming weather. The National Park Service, which maintains the trees, said on Wednesday that the pink and white blossoms could reach their peak as soon as March 14, a full three weeks earlier than normal. If the flowers indeed pop on that date, it will be the earliest bloom on record. That is thanks to springlike weather that has made a roaring early advance across much of the United States in recent weeks, breaking records from New England to the Deep South and punctuating a mild winter. In Texas, which experienced temperatures in the high 80s on several days in February, flowers and trees are in bloom well ahead of schedule. Chicago has had only dustings of snow so far this year  —   far below the 9. 1 inches expected in February. And in New York State, maple syrup producers started tapping their trees two months before they normally do. “The key thing is it’s not just the East Coast and the blooming of cherry blossoms,” said Kevin Trenberth, a climatologist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research. “This is going on all over the world. ” Here in Washington, the warmth has organizers of the annual National Cherry Blossom Festival, a monthlong series of performances and other events, racing to meet the early flowering. Diana Mayhew, the festival’s president, said officials made the decision on Tuesday to begin five days earlier than planned, on March 15, after representatives from the Park Service briefed them on their forecast. Ms. Mayhew said she expected as many as a million and a half people to take part in the   festival, with many of them crowding the   pathways that line the Tidal Basin from dawn to well past dusk. The cherry trees date to 1912, when Japan gave some 3, 000 of them to the United States as a gesture of friendship. Only a handful of the original trees remain, but thousands more have been planted since. Michael Litterst, a spokesman for the National Park Service, said the agency made its annual bloom prediction based on history, natural indicators on the trees and the weather forecast. The trees are considered to be in peak bloom when 70 percent of the basin’s most common variety, Yoshino, are in flower. In a typical year, that comes on April 4. But not this year. Given the mild winter and rare February warmth, the Park Service says the peak should come between March 14 and 17, depending on the weather in the coming weeks. The record, set in 1990, is March 15. Like much of the central and eastern United States, Washington has seen a winter of record and   warmth. February here was the warmest on record, with average temperatures almost 9 degrees above normal and one degree higher than a normal March. This year may be a partial anomaly, Mr. Litterst said, but the average date of peak bloom has shifted forward by almost five days since record keeping began in 1921. On Thursday, as wind cutting across the Tidal Basin tossed heavy buds through the air, a small group of blossom hunters clustered near a lone, rippling flower that they said they were happy to welcome early. Ryan Cook was delighted to be among them. On a work trip to the capital with his son, Noah, Mr. Cook had been monitoring the blossoms’ development online in hopes of catching a glimpse before leaving town. As they stopped to take a picture, though, Mr. Cook said he was a bit uneasy with a winter that even at home in Morral, Ohio, has been unusually warm  —   “scarily so. ” “Just the fact that winter isn’t what it used to be  —   it just doesn’t make sense,” he said, saying it was almost certainly a sign of the changing climate that scientific studies describe. “I’ll go with the scientists. ”	1

Most recently 17 year-old Emily Stone died while doing the “Condom Challenge”. So the question is why are teens and college kids still doing the “Condom Challenge”?Part of it is because they don’t believe that anything bad will happen to them. “In adolescence, there’s a feeling of invincibility,” Michelle Tyson, Ph.D., clinical professor of psychology at the Dallas M&P institute and clinical psychologist in private practice in Dallas, Says. “Because this generation is full of f*cking idiots who anything to be cool.

963	 The Paris Zoological Park is being sued after a woman claims she was sexually assaulted by a hippopotamus that had escaped the zoo for only a few hours yesterday.The large semiaquatic mammal apparently was able to slip out of its enclosure last night after massive flooding and a fallen tree severely damaged the security fence.Geraldine Boudin, 54, owner of a bakery next to the Zoological Park, is suing the zoo’s administration after she claims she was sexually assaulted by the huge beast after she was returning home that night. WNDR assumes however all responsibility for the satirical nature of its articles and for the fictional nature of their content. All characters appearing in the articles in this website – even those based on real people –  are entirely fictional and any resemblance between them and any persons, living, dead, or undead is purely a miracle. The husband of a Bronx woman who died abroad after she was allegedly barred from flying back to the U.S. for being too fat has settled his $6 million lawsuit against the airlines, the Daily News has learned.Janos Soltesz, 57, quietly settled his wrongful death suit against Delta, KLM Royal Dutch and Lufthansa airlines in late August, court documents show.The suit accused the airlines of having sent his 407-pound wife Vilma “on a debilitating ‘wild goose chase’ from airline to airline, airport to home, and country to country” that caused her to lose her life in Oct. 2012. They were unforgettable pictures: wild animals roaming the streets of Tbilisi last month, after escaping from the city’s flood-stricken zoo. The Georgian capital had become an urban jungle. The surreal sight of a giant African hippo lumbering past brightly lit shops and snacking on roadside greenery before being tranquilised and gingerly ushered back inside the devastated zoo complex made front pages worldwide. These were almost biblical scenes of bears fighting to stay above the floodwaters, or mud-caked lions and tigers drowned or shot dead, although there was no ark to come to the rescue.	0
65	WEST PALM BEACH, Fla.  —   Black plastic covered the doors and windows in an ornate suite at one of President Trump’s resorts on Saturday, as he bonded with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan over a round of golf on a pristine day. The covering blocked American and Japanese journalists from capturing a glimpse of the leaders on the lush private course in Jupiter, Fla. But Mr. Trump’s aides snapped their own picture of the friendly tableau, posting a photo of the men sharing a   with an American flag waving majestically in the distance, to the president’s social media accounts for his millions of followers to see. “Having a great time hosting Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in the United States!” Mr. Trump’s post said. This, after all, was the point of inviting Mr. Abe to his    resort in Palm Beach: a chance to have a   weekend hosting a foreign leader with whom he has said he wants to develop a close relationship. It allowed Mr. Trump to capitalize on some unscripted moments after an initial period in office marred by antagonistic exchanges with some foreign leaders. The news media blackout was nothing unusual in the annals of presidential free time. President Barack Obama routinely played golf out of sight of the press pool that traveled with him, only occasionally allowing a glimpse of him taking a swing or interacting with his partners. But it was the latest reminder that Mr. Trump’s presidency is mixing his official role with the business that bears his name. Mr. Abe’s visit was the first of what Mr. Trump’s top aides say will be many in which he uses    the     and   castle on Florida’s Gold Coast, as a setting for forging   relationships with important world leaders. That is likely to mean that the property  —   along with Trump golf courses nearby in Jupiter and West Palm Beach, where the president squired Mr. Abe on Saturday, along with the professional golfer Ernie Els  —   will draw increased attention and prominence, with all the potential for additional profit that brings.    has doubled its initiation rate for new members, to $200, 000. “We got to know each other very, very well” on the golf course, Mr. Trump told reporters Saturday evening as he stood beside Mr. Abe and their wives on the way to dinner at   . Nearby, a line of clubgoers in formal wear maneuvered Bentleys and   into the driveway as a full moon rose over the palm trees. The administration said that Mr. Trump was hosting Mr. Abe and his wife as a “gift” to the Japanese leader and has said that any profits earned from the stays of members of foreign governments at Trump properties during his presidency would be donated to the United States Treasury, to avoid the appearance that he was cashing in on his office. It may be a frequent arrangement. Mr. Trump, his aides say, believes in getting to know foreign leaders with whom he will be spending time and taking their measure in informal settings outside Washington. “President Trump is a deal maker, and his coin of the realm is personal relationships and trying to convince people to negotiate a certain way in his favor, so this is what he does,” Kathryn Dunn Tenpas, a scholar at the Brookings Institution who has studied presidential travel, said. Mr. Trump is not the first president to make use of a personal retreat to engage in informal diplomacy. George W. Bush hosted foreign leaders at his ranch in Crawford, Texas, while Bill Clinton used Camp David, the official presidential retreat near Thurmont, Md. as an informal backdrop for   diplomacy, including efforts to forge peace in the Middle East. But for Mr. Trump, his retreat is also a   club that benefits his family business, from which he has declined to divest. “It’s just one more example of using public office for private gain,” Richard W. Painter, a White House counsel to Mr. Bush who is an expert on government ethics, said. “He’s going to Trump this, Trump that  —   it’s clearly designed to raise the value of the brand and send the message to foreign leaders that you ought to patronize Trump properties if you want to get in good with the president. ” On Saturday, Mr. Trump appeared to have taken some steps to separate the personal from the political. While Mr. Trump and Mr. Abe shuttled from resort to resort in the armored presidential limousine known as the Beast, the flags that normally flutter on the front and the presidential seals that usually adorn the doors were absent, an indication that these were not official stops. There were other reminders that the visit was unfolding almost exclusively on Mr. Trump’s own turf. At the Trump National Golf Club in Jupiter, journalists traveling with him were admonished not to take pictures or video. “It’s a private club,” an aide explained.	1
913	 While scientists experiment with mother nature, they end up unearthing specimens from the past that they may end up wishing they had left alone, as these specimens could prove to be dangerous to our environment.Take the prehistoric owl that was cloned in Brazil for instance.Ornimegalonyx as this giant cursorial owl is known as, was extinct and measured 3’7″ in height when fully grown:Brian Christopher was the lead scientist at Fogarty International Center. He was doing a routine inspection on the bird. When he opened the cage, the owl immediately attacked, placing its foot on each shoulder and violently gouging out his eyes.

197	Getting sick can put a damper on any vacation, but it can be especially unsettling and even scary when it happens in another country. Here, Matthew Klapetzky, a registered nurse and the clinical director of Passport Health, the travel clinic at the University of Rochester School of Nursing, shares tips on what to do if illness hits you while abroad. “The majority of minor health issues that international travelers contend with can easily be   with a good   kit,” Mr. Klapetzky said. It should include an   medication such as Imodium   or   because diarrhea is the most common ailment among travelers from the United States and hits around half of them. “This happens when your body gets a stomach bug as a reaction to a natural bacteria of a given land, and though it’s not usually serious, it lasts two to four days and can be extremely dehydrating,” he said. Other musts in the kit: ibuprofen to reduce fevers, muscle inflammation and joint pain bandages in assorted sizes along with an antibiotic ointment such as Neosporin for cuts and wounds oral rehydration supplements such as CeraLyte to replenish electrolytes lost through sweating and diarrhea blister pads and fiber supplements to ease constipation, also common during travel. Also, be sure to carry an EpiPen if you have allergies such as to tree nuts. If you twist your ankle, develop heat rash or have another    situation where you need to see a doctor, don’t hesitate to use local care. “Remember that the doctors where you are in the world are used to treating ailments specific to that region, such as severe sunburn, which is common in the tropics, so they are going to be your best bet to treat such issues,” Mr. Klapetzky said. Travelers can find local medical care through the State Department website but should be aware that the department does not take responsibility for the quality of service provided by any doctor or hospital on the list. In more dire health situations such as a heart attack or serious car accident, Mr. Klapetzky suggested contacting the local embassy of the United States. “The embassy can help get you airlifted out of the country and back home if that’s what’s required and can also help you, if you need it, arrange to have money wired over to pay for your care,” he said. Travelers should note that while the embassy is a valuable resource, it does not pay for these services or any medical care.	1
587	 #1 No More Smoking In Cars With ChildrenThe law, that becomes effective on January 30, 2018 is to protect children from secondhand smoking. Violations would result in a fine of up to $100.#2 Thousands Of ChemicalsAccording to the Department of Health, when a child breathes in secondhand smoke, they breathe in thousands of chemicals, just like the smoker does. This puts them at risk of serious conditions including cancer, bronchitis, and pneumonia. And it can worsen asthma.#3 All Private VehiclesThe law applies to any private vehicle that is enclosed wholly or partly by a roof. It still applies if people have the windows or sunroof open, have the air-conditioning on, or if they sit in a parked car with the door open. Starting October 1, 2016, it will be illegal to smoke in a car or other vehicles, with anyone under the age of 18. The law is changing to protect children and young people from the dangers of secondhand smoke. Both the driver and the smoker in the car could be fined as much as $80. This law applies to every driver, including those age 17 and those with a driving permit.	0
785	 Is this true? Ben Carson Loses Brain Surgeon License After Making Numerous Brainless CommentsHis personal comments on the subjects that were stated for the reasons all 50 states revoked his license do not seem legit and ALL 50 states revoking his license at the same time and making a joint statement as to why. The Medical Boards for all 50 States in the Union announced today that they have revoked Ben Carson’s medical license and will no longer allow him to operate as a brain surgeon anywhere in the U.S. And they cited as their reason Carson’s mental and intellectual challenges — otherwise known as the propensity to sound like a total and utter nutcase.In a joint statement, the Medical Boards said: We have been increasingly concerned about the gibberish emanating from Mr. Carson’s cerebrum. We cite by way of example his belief that the holocaust could have been prevented by armed German citizens, that straight people go into prison and come out gay, and that Obamacare is the worse thing to happen to the country since slavery.We are therefore suspending his medical license in any state where he is qualified to practice. And should he choose to come out of retirement and re-apply for credentials, we will not allow him to operate on people’s cerebrums, or indeed cerebullums, limbic systems and brain stems, until he can demonstrate that his own are in fully working order.”	0
741	 A chilling report issued by the Main Intelligence Directorate General Staff of the Armed Forces (GRU) is warning today that the pet dogs and puppies of American owners have now become “targets for death” after the Islamic State’s (ISIS/ISIL/Daesh) top religious scholar, Turki al-Bin‘ali, issued a fatwa authorizing the immediate mass slaughter of these beloved animals by their terrorist supporters currently residing in the United States.According to this report, this Islamic legal pronouncement (fatwa) issued by the Islamic State Caliphates main ideological-religious leader, who currently resides under the protection of the US at their Bahrain naval base (NSAB), was in response to queries from many of their younger American “sympathizers/supporters” wanting to wage jihad but fearful of being captured or killed—or not being of sufficient age to “obtain/purchase” weapons.Turki al-Bin‘ali’s response to these American followers, as outlined in his fatwa published earlier today in the Islamic State’s online magazine Dabiq, this report continues, was that while although the main duty of jihad was to “kill/destroy/main” as many infidels (non-believers/Christians/Jews, etc.) as possible, no matter what the cost, it is entirely acceptable, also, to strike fear into these Westerners by the mass murdering of their dogs and puppies.

258	On the campaign trail, long before he called the news media “the enemy of the American people,” President Trump pledged to curtail press freedom. “We’re going to open up those libel laws,” he said. The statement was puzzling, not least because opening up laws is not a thing. And if it were a thing, it would be done by legislatures or courts, not the president. Read generously, though, Mr. Trump’s statement may have meant that he intended to appoint Supreme Court justices who would vote to overturn precedents that make it hard to sue for libel. On this score, at least, Judge Neil M. Gorsuch, Mr. Trump’s Supreme Court nominee, seems destined to disappoint his patron. Judge Gorsuch’s decisions in libel and related cases show no inclination to cut back on protections for the press. Some plaintiffs, he wrote in a 2011 opinion, have reputations so poor that even serious accusations cannot damage them. Libel law, he said, is “about protecting a good reputation honestly earned. ” Judge Gorsuch added that minor inaccuracies in a news report can never serve as the basis for a libel suit, calling that “a First Amendment imperative. ” Press lawyers who have reviewed Judge Gorsuch’s decisions said they liked what they saw. “In a handful of opinions where he has weighed in on the subject, Judge Gorsuch shows no indication that he will ‘open up libel laws’ to muzzle the press, as the president appears to hope,” said Gayle C. Sproul, a lawyer with Levine Sullivan Koch  Schulz in Philadelphia. Eugene Volokh, an expert in First Amendment law at the University of California, Los Angeles, said Judge Gorsuch’s commitment to free speech was not guarded or grudging. “Sometimes when judges apply the rules, you can see that they’re holding their nose,” Professor Volokh said. “He didn’t seem to be. ” The question in the 2011 case was whether a Colorado prisoner, Jerry Lee Bustos, could sue the makers of a cable television show for calling him a member of the Aryan Brotherhood, a prison gang, when Mr. Bustos had merely conspired with the gang. Judge Gorsuch said there was no reason to think that Mr. Bustos’s “standing in the public eye would be improved at all by more careful explication of the true particulars of his involvement with the Brotherhood. ” A version of this issue arose during Mr. Trump’s presidential campaign, when his lawyers asked for a retraction of an article in The New York Times reporting on complaints from two women who said Mr. Trump had touched them inappropriately. Mr. Trump’s lawyers called the article libelous and seemed to threaten to sue. David McCraw, a lawyer for The Times, responded much as Judge Gorsuch had. “The essence of a libel claim, of course, is the protection of one’s reputation,” Mr. McCraw wrote. But Mr. Trump’s reputation in this area, Mr. McCraw said, could not have been harmed by The Times’s report in light of, for instance, Mr. Trump’s own statements about groping women. “Nothing in our article has had the slightest effect on the reputation that Mr. Trump, through his own words and actions, has already created for himself,” Mr. McCraw wrote. So far, there has been no lawsuit over the article. Gregg Leslie, the legal defense director for the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, said Judge Gorsuch did not have “an extensive history of speech and press cases. ” But the judge “consistently applied established First Amendment protections when he did get them,” Mr. Leslie said. “He also showed a willingness to uphold protections for speech rights even in controversial cases. It’s always good to see a judge do the right thing in tougher circumstances. ” Ms. Sproul said Judge Gorsuch had voted in favor of news organizations in    cases, even when they involved “classically sympathetic plaintiffs, like a victim of sexual assault and by cops cleared of wrongdoing. ” In a 2007 case concerning the broadcast of a videotape of a rape, Judge Gorsuch joined an opinion dismissing a lawsuit by the victim. The court ruled that the news report concerned “a matter of legitimate public interest. ” He joined a second 2007 decision dismissing a case brought by undercover police officers on similar grounds. “Courts have generally treated allegations of police misconduct as worthy of public interest,” the decision said, refusing to carve out an exception for disclosing the identities of police officers working undercover. “We can find no precedent for such an exception, and we are not inclined to create one here merely on policy grounds,” the decision said, “despite our concerns about the safety of undercover officers and the need to avoid disincentives for entering their profession. ” Judge Gorsuch has also read other protections of the First Amendment broadly, including the right of citizens “to petition the government for a redress of grievances. ” That clause, he wrote in a 2007 case involving an unhappy taxpayer, “does not pick and choose its causes. ” “The minor and questionable, along with the mighty and consequential, are all embraced,” Judge Gorsuch wrote. Ronald K. L. Collins, a First Amendment specialist at the University of Washington, said the Supreme Court would benefit from Judge Gorsuch’s “  and informed devotion to free expression. ” “If confirmed,” Mr. Collins said, “Neil Gorsuch will be a   First Amendment player  —   an intellectual and rhetorical force to be reckoned with. ” But Judge Gorsuch seems unlikely to use his skills to advance Mr. Trump’s agenda in libel cases, said Professor Volokh, who has known the judge for decades. “To the extent people are worried that President Trump has an    project,” Professor Volokh said, “there’s nothing to suggest Neil would share that project. ”	1

An executive order signed by the President so ISIS can open a center and train youths in Dearborn, Michigan.      Following months of obstruction by state officials, the federal government intervened on behalf of a Muslim group who is outspokenly supportive of the Islamic State, to open the doors of a new Islamic youth outreach center in a lower-income area in the city of Dearborn. The facility will be run by Syrian-born Aisha Hani-Salaam, a recent immigrant and unapologetic supporter of ISIS.President Obama, who signed the executive order to allow the center, said, “We need to take advantage of every opportunity to end the violence between our people. Hopefully this will start a new era in relations between the United States and the religion of Islam. Muslims are understandably angry over the Western media’s overblown portrayal of ISIL as merciless killers. I believe this is a good opportunity to end the fighting and use diplomacy to usher in a new era of peace, as well as gain a powerful new ally in that part of the world.”Despite the President’s hopeful and reassuring message, Hani-Salaam remains angry and openly criticizes some American Muslims for their ‘lukewarm’ traditional condemnations of the United States.  	0

274	WASHINGTON  —   President Trump has directed his administration to enforce the nation’s immigration laws more aggressively, unleashing the full force of the federal government to find, arrest and deport those in the country illegally, regardless of whether they have committed serious crimes. Documents released on Tuesday by the Department of Homeland Security revealed the broad scope of the president’s ambitions: to publicize crimes by undocumented immigrants strip such immigrants of privacy protections enlist local police officers as enforcers erect new detention facilities discourage asylum seekers and, ultimately, speed up deportations. The new enforcement policies put into practice language that Mr. Trump used on the campaign trail, vastly expanding the definition of “criminal aliens” and warning that such unauthorized immigrants “routinely victimize Americans,” disregard the “rule of law and pose a threat” to people in communities across the United States. Despite those assertions in the new documents, research shows lower levels of crime among immigrants than among   Americans. The president’s new immigration policies are likely to be welcomed by some law enforcement officials around the country, who have called for a tougher crackdown on unauthorized immigrants, and by some Republicans in Congress who have argued that lax enforcement encourages a   flow of unauthorized immigrants. But taken together, the new policies are a rejection of the sometimes more restrained efforts by former Presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush and their predecessors, who sought to balance protecting the nation’s borders with fiscal, logistical and humanitarian limits on the exercise of laws passed by Congress. “The faithful execution of our immigration laws is best achieved by using all these statutory authorities to the greatest extent practicable,” John F. Kelly, the secretary of homeland security, wrote in one of two memorandums released on Tuesday. “Accordingly, department personnel shall make full use of these authorities. ” The immediate impact of that shift is not yet fully known. Advocates for immigrants warned on Tuesday that the new border control and enforcement directives would create an atmosphere of fear that was likely to drive those in the country illegally deeper into the shadows. Administration officials said some of the new policies  —   like one seeking to send unauthorized border crossers from Central America to Mexico while they await deportation hearings  —   could take months to put in effect and might be limited in scope. For now,   Dreamers, who were brought to the United States as young children, will not be targeted unless they commit crimes, officials said on Tuesday. Mr. Trump has not yet said where he will get the billions of dollars needed to pay for thousands of new border control agents, a network of detention facilities to detain unauthorized immigrants and a wall along the entire southern border with Mexico. But politically, Mr. Kelly’s actions on Tuesday serve to reinforce the president’s standing among a core constituency  —   those who blame unauthorized immigrants for taking jobs away from citizens, committing heinous crimes and being a financial burden on federal, state and local governments. And because of the changes, millions of immigrants in the country illegally now face a far greater likelihood of being discovered, arrested and eventually deported. “The message is: The immigration law is back in business,” said Mark Krikorian, the executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, which supports restricted immigration. “That violating immigration law is no longer a secondary offense. ” Lawyers and advocates for immigrants said the new policies could still be challenged in court. Maricopa County in Arizona spent years defending its sheriff at the time, Joseph Arpaio, in federal court, where he was found to have discriminated against Latinos. And courts in Illinois, Oregon, Pennsylvania and several other states have rejected the power given to local and state law enforcement officers to hold immigrants for up to 48 hours beyond their scheduled release from detention at the request of federal authorities under a program known as Secure Communities, which Mr. Trump is reviving. “When you tell state and local police that their job is to do immigration enforcement,” said Omar Jadwat, director of the American Civil Liberties Union’s Immigrants’ Rights Project, “it translates into the unwarranted and illegal targeting of people because of their race, because of their language, because of the color of their skin. ” Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, said on Tuesday that the president wanted to “take the shackles off” of the nation’s immigration enforcers. He insisted that the new policies made it clear that “the No. 1 priority is that people who pose a threat to our country are immediately dealt with. ” In fact, that was already the policy under the Obama administration, which instructed agents that undocumented immigrants convicted of serious crimes were the priority for deportation. Now, enforcement officials have been directed to seek the deportation of anyone in the country illegally. “Under this executive order, ICE will not exempt classes or categories of removal aliens from potential enforcement,” a fact sheet released by the Department of Homeland Security said, using the acronym for Immigration and Customs Enforcement. “All of those present in violation of the immigration laws may be subject to immigration arrest, detention, and, if found removable by final order, removal from the United States. ” That includes people convicted of fraud in any official matter before a governmental agency and people who “have abused any program related to receipt of public benefits. ” The policy also expands a program that lets officials bypass due process protections such as court hearings in some deportation cases. Under the Obama administration, the program, known as “expedited removal,” was used only when an immigrant was arrested within 100 miles of the border and had been in the country no more than 14 days. Now it will include all those who have been in the country for up to two years, no matter where they are caught. “The administration seems to be putting its foot down as far as the gas pedal will go,” said Heidi Altman, policy director for the National Immigrant Justice Center, a   group that offers legal services to immigrants. In the documents released on Tuesday, the Department of Homeland Security is directed to begin the process of hiring 10, 000 immigration and customs agents, expanding the number of detention facilities and creating an office within Immigration and Customs Enforcement to help families of those killed by undocumented immigrants. The directives would also revive a program that recruits local police officers and sheriff’s deputies to help with deportation, effectively making them de facto immigration agents. The effort, called the 287( g) program, was scaled back during the Obama administration. The program faces resistance from many states and dozens of   sanctuary cities, which have refused to allow their law enforcement workers to help round up undocumented individuals. In New York, Mayor Bill de Blasio in a statement on Tuesday pledged the city’s cooperation in cases involving “proven public safety threats,” but vowed that “what we will not do is turn our N. Y. P. D. officers into immigration agents. ” Under the new directives, the agency would no longer provide privacy protections to people who are not American citizens or green card holders. A policy established in the last days of the Bush administration in January 2009 provided some legal protection for information collected by the Department of Homeland Security on nonresidents. The new policies also target unauthorized immigrants who smuggle their children into the country, as happened with Central American children seeking to reunite with parents living in the United States. Under the new directives, such parents could face deportation or prosecution for smuggling or human trafficking. Officials said that returning Central American refugees to Mexico to await hearings would be done only in a limited fashion, and only after discussions with the government of Mexico. Mexican officials said on Tuesday that such a move could violate Mexican law and international accords governing repatriation, and immigrants’ advocates questioned Mexico’s ability to absorb thousands of Central Americans in detention centers and shelters.	1
102	SALTILLO, Mexico  —   Wendy no longer worries that when her sons leave the apartment in the morning, they may never make it to school. Memories of the gangs that haunted their lives in Honduras are slowly receding into the past. The family fled its home last year after gang members tried to recruit the boys, threatening them with death if they did not join. They received asylum in Mexico, making them among the country’s newest residents. “It’s not easy  —   as you can imagine  —   starting again,” Wendy said in an interview in this small city in northeastern Mexico, where the family decided to settle. “But we are better here because we are safer. ” The United States has long been the dream destination for many Latin American migrants, whether fleeing poverty, political unrest, natural disaster or violence. But now a growing number of migrants are putting down roots in Mexico, legally or illegally, instead of using it as a thruway to the United States. They have many reasons for staying here. Crossing the   States border has become increasingly difficult, migrants say, especially with rising smugglers’ fees and tougher enforcement. Some are deterred by the abundance of dangers that lurk on the route through Mexico. Some believe it might be easier to qualify for some form of legal status in Mexico than in the United States. In recent weeks, yet another factor has begun to weigh on some northbound migrants: President Trump. Even if all the details of his recent policy declarations on immigration have not yet permeated the migration grapevine, his longstanding promises to restrict immigration have fueled a growing perception among migrants that the United States is becoming far less hospitable to immigrants, documented and undocumented alike. “Here, at least, the people like you, they help you,” said Josué, 31, an undocumented immigrant from Honduras staying at Casa del Migrante, a migrant shelter here in Saltillo. “Why would you want to go to a country that doesn’t like you?” (Like other migrants interviewed, Josué requested partial anonymity, in his case because of his undocumented status. Others said they feared being tracked down by their persecutors.) Josué came to Mexico about a year ago with the intention of “passing through” on his way to the United States, he said. But he was able to find work and liked Mexico enough, so he decided to stay for a while before resuming his trip. With the rise of Mr. Trump, however, and the president’s vows to harden the borders of the United States and step up deportations, Josué has decided to remain in Mexico for the foreseeable future. “In my case, I’d like to be in the United States to work,” he said during a recent interview at the shelter. “But this president, he doesn’t want anybody because he doesn’t like anybody. ” Josué is now exploring ways to gain legal status in Mexico. The number of migrants deciding to stay in Mexico is still thought to be a small fraction of the hundreds of thousands using the country as a transit corridor to enter the United States. But the growing attractiveness of Mexico is plainly reflected in the country’s asylum program. Last year, more than 8, 100 foreigners applied for asylum, nearly three times as many as in 2015, and more than 15 times as many as five years ago, according to statistics from the Mexican government. At the same time, Mexico, under pressure from immigrants’ advocates, has been granting asylum at increasingly higher rates, in part because of improvements to its intake and processing system. In 2016, 63 percent of applicants, not including those who dropped their cases during the review process, received asylum or some other form of protection, up from 46 percent in 2015. Most applicants in the last few years have been from El Salvador and Honduras, which have been convulsing with gang violence. The increase in asylum petitions in Mexico is also in part due to the rise in detentions on the country’s southern flank, an effect of an   plan begun in 2014 to better control the flow of people and goods crossing the   border. After being stopped by the immigration authorities, some detainees have come to learn that they may be eligible for asylum, either through word of mouth from other detainees or during screenings with immigration officials. “Many come here not knowing that the experiences they’ve had fit perfectly with asylum,” said Javier Martínez Hernández, a lawyer at Casa del Migrante, which helped more than 100 migrants apply for refugee status in 2016, more than double the number in 2015. If the current trends continue, United Nations officials predict, Mexico could receive more than 20, 000 asylum claims this year. But advocacy and human rights groups believe that the population of migrants potentially eligible for protection in Mexico is much higher. Many of the more than 147, 000 foreigners deported from Mexico last year, for instance, might not have known that they qualified and were not given the opportunity to make their case before being deported, they say. In the past year, the Mexican government has made a number of improvements to its asylum system, including increasing its staff and modifying the screening process to ensure that eligible migrants have a chance to apply, officials said. The Mexican authorities have also begun releasing asylum seekers from detention while they await the resolution of their cases, a process that often takes three or more months, and have improved applicants’ access to humanitarian aid and psychological and legal counseling, advocates said. “The Mexican government has recognized that this is increasingly a refugee situation,” said Mark Manly, the Mexico representative for the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. He added that the Mexican authorities had been making “real progress” in improving processing and services for asylum seekers. The government and the United Nations have sponsored a pilot program in Saltillo to help integrate asylum seekers into Mexican society. Begun in August, the program has so far involved 38 asylum recipients. Of those, 26 remain in the program, while the others have left and moved elsewhere. Saltillo was chosen because it has plenty of employment opportunities and is relatively calm and safe, United Nations officials said. Several program participants said life in Mexico was not easy, despite all the assistance they had received. It is hard to make ends meet salaries at the bottom rung of the ladder are barely enough to cover the cost of living. And some, in the interest of disconnecting from the menacing world they left, have cut off all contact with friends, relatives and old colleagues in their home countries. “It’s very sad to leave everything in your country,” said Ana, 41, a Salvadoran who immigrated to Mexico with her son, 18, and her two daughters, 15 and 21, after gangs tried to recruit her son and started threatening one of her daughters. “Can you imagine? We had everything,” Ana added. “My children studying and then coming here and sleeping on the ground? It’s not easy. ” But all said they were happier in Mexico, in large part because they did not fear for their lives. “I left all my friends and family, but after what happened, it made me happy to leave,” said Ana’s son, Fernando, who found work here cleaning rooms in a hotel. His older sister, who had been planning to enter a university in El Salvador to study medicine, works in the laundry room at another hotel. Still, for many, the allure of the United States is hard to extinguish. Wendy and her husband, José, have both found work  —   he with an   contractor and she cleaning a private home. The boys are happy in their new school and are making friends. Yet the family is having a hard time covering expenses. “I still have that aspiration to go to the United States or Canada someday,” José allowed as he sat with Wendy in their kitchen here. Both were wearing winter coats indoors because they couldn’t afford heaters to warm them against the cold. Wendy saw where the conversation was heading  —   down a road they had clearly traveled many times  —   and she intervened. “Our idea is to have our own home, build our own business. That’s the idea,” she said enthusiastically. “If we had a home of our own, I’d stay here for the rest of my life. ”	1

181	Every continent save Antarctica is ringed by vast stretches of seagrass, underwater prairies that together cover an area roughly equal to California. Seagrass meadows, among the most endangered ecosystems on Earth, play an outsize role in the health of the oceans. They shelter important fish species, filter pollutants from seawater, and lock up huge amounts of   carbon. The plants also fight disease, it turns out. A team of scientists reported on Thursday that seagrasses can purge pathogens from the ocean that threaten humans and coral reefs alike. (The first hint came when the scientists were struck with dysentery after diving to coral reefs without neighboring seagrass.) But the meadows are vanishing at a rate of a football field every 30 minutes. Joleah B. Lamb, a postdoctoral researcher at Cornell University and the lead author of the new study, said she hoped it would help draw attention to their plight. “We call seagrass the ugly stepchild of marine organisms,” said Dr. Lamb. “They don’t get a lot of respect, compared to corals and mangroves. ” Seagrass first evolved tens of millions years ago, when some flowering plants moved from land into the ocean. They still grow flowers, pollen and seeds, but they now do so underwater, with a powerful form of photosynthesis that allows them to thrive in dim light at depths of up to 190 feet. The sediment in which they grow is loaded with deadly hydrogen sulfide. They detoxify by pumping some of the oxygen they release during photosynthesis into their roots. With these adaptations, seagrass meadows became more productive than today’s fertilized cornfields. As they spread across the planet, the meadows altered the sea floor, building soil and supporting entirely new ecosystems. Animals like manatees and juvenile fish took up residence. “Killer whales are a big tourist attraction, but people probably don’t realize that seagrass beds are really important as nurseries for the fish that the salmon require, which the killer whales require,” said C. Drew Harvell, a marine biologist at Cornell University and senior author of the new study. Humans depend on these nurseries, too. Many of the species harvested in commercial fisheries begin life in seagrass meadows. Without them, fishermen would catch far less, and make less money. In 2014, University of Cambridge researchers studied seagrass meadows in southern Australia to estimate the value they bring to the fisheries industry. They estimate that each acre of seagrass adds about $87, 000 per year. The plants also draw fertilizer runoff and other pollutants out of the water, locking them safely away in meadow soil. Scientists have estimated that an acre of seagrass provides more than $11, 000 worth of filtering every year. These services alone would make seagrass meadows among the most economically valuable ecosystems on Earth. But now Dr. Harvell, Dr. Lamb and their colleagues have found that these plants may help us in another way: by wiping out pathogens. Their new study, published in the journal Science, began with a scuba diving trip in Indonesia. The scientists were inspecting coral reefs for infections with bacteria and fungi some reefs are increasingly falling prey to these diseases. “By the end of the   workshop, we all came down with amoebic dysentery,” recalled Dr. Harvell. “One scientist developed typhoid, and we had to ship her out. ” The experience left Dr. Harvell wondering if the illnesses of the scientists might somehow be connected to those of the reefs. “It just got me thinking about human health and environmental health and how they’re linked,” she said. She discussed the idea with Dr. Lamb, who began to investigate. Seagrass meadows can release so much oxygen that the surrounding water fizzes like champagne. That oxygen might be able to kill pathogens, Dr. Lamb realized. The plants also host fungi, which are known to producing   compounds. Dr. Lamb and her colleagues decided to study sites around four islands in Indonesia with and without nearby seagrass. The scientists devised two strategies to search for pathogens. In one survey, they collected seawater and put it in petri dishes to see if colonies of   bacteria known as Enterococcus grew from the samples. Levels of the bacteria in water from seagrass meadows, they found, were a third of the levels in water from other sites. In a second search, the scientists grabbed fragments of DNA floating in seawater. By examining the sequences, they identified 18 kinds of   bacteria. Water from the seagrass meadows had only half the level of this DNA, compared with water collected at other sites. The scientists next turned their attention to coral reefs around the islands. Reefs next to seagrass meadows, they found, were half as diseased as those without meadows. Thorsten B. Reusch, a marine ecologist at the GEOMAR Helmholtz Center for Ocean Research in Germany who was not involved in the study, called it “truly fascinating and innovative. ” He also warned that “it remains to be seen what the exact mechanisms of the pathogen removal are. ” Dr. Lamb and her colleagues are now searching for those mechanisms. They’re also trying to put a number on the value of seagrass’s   powers. “There could be a huge potential in how valuable they become,” said Dr. Lamb. Robert J. Orth, a seagrass expert at the Virginia Institute of Marine Science who was not involved in the new report, predicted it would lead to similar research on seagrass meadows in other parts of the world. “It’s going to make people think,” he said. The growing recognition of this plant’s importance comes even as it is disappearing. Nearly a third of the world’s seagrass meadows have died off since the 19th century. A number of studies indicate that they are now disappearing at an accelerating pace. Last week, Dr. Orth and his colleagues published a detailed study of the retreat of seagrass in Chesapeake Bay in the journal Global Change Biology. Since just 1991, they estimate, 29 percent of the bay’s seagrass meadows have vanished. Their research points to two main culprits. Eroded dirt washes into the Chesapeake, making the water cloudy. Seagrass get so little sunlight that the resulting dimming can be deadly. Seagrass is also being pummeled by climate change. Warmer summer temperatures in Chesapeake Bay cause the plants to lose much of their oxygen through their leaves. With less oxygen to pump into their roots, they are poisoned by toxic sediments. The cloudiness of the water makes the heat even worse. With less sunlight, the plants produce even less protective oxygen to begin with. “We have a double whammy,” said Dr. Orth. As the underwater meadows disappear, economic value disappears with them. The Chesapeake Bay meadows are a nursery for blue crabs, for example. Dr. Orth and his colleagues estimate that the seagrass   has eliminated more than 500 million juvenile blue crabs since 1991. Seagrass meadows can store enormous amounts of carbon. Their soils don’t decompose because they have very little oxygen in them. As a result, seagrass meadow soil around the world has accumulated an estimated nine billion tons of carbon. As seagrass meadows disappear, that carbon is being released back into the ocean. Some of it may make its way into the atmosphere as   carbon dioxide. As dire as the situation has become, there is cause for hope. In recent years, Dr. Orth and his colleagues have successfully restored seagrass meadows off the coast of Virginia. “Now we have 6, 200 acres of seagrass,” he said, “where in 1997 there wasn’t a single blade of grass. ”	1

876	 I am looking to find out if Dianne Feinstein actually said the following.  It was supposedly on “Morning California”.Feinstein openly objects to treating PTSD in combat veterans“If individuals are having nightmares and panic attacks about the atrocities they have committed overseas while following orders from a war criminal like former President George Bush, then quite honestly they deserve it.”   The last thing this country needs is to make a dangerous and addicting drug easily and readily available. What kind of message would that be if we federally allowed people to choose for themselves what they can and can’t put into their body? We have those regulations for a reason. It’s bad enough that the American public can just chow down willy-nilly on fattening foods with little restraint, why should we give them a substance that would make them want to eat even more?Now we are hearing all this nonsense about how medical marijuana could alleviate the symptoms of PTSD in soldiers coming back from the Middle East. If individuals are having nightmares and panic attacks about the atrocities they have committed overseas while following orders from a war criminal like former President George Bush, then quite honestly they deserve it. We shouldn’t free them from their guilt any more then we should free a murderer or rapist from their prison cells.	0

188	WASHINGTON  —   The Senate confirmed Scott Pruitt on Friday to run the Environmental Protection Agency, putting a seasoned legal opponent of the agency at the helm of President Trump’s efforts to dismantle major regulations on climate change and clean water  —   and to cut the size and authority of the government’s environmental enforcer. Senators voted 52 to 46 to confirm Mr. Pruitt, the Oklahoma attorney general who has built a career out of suing to block the E. P. A. ’s major environmental rules and has called for the dissolution of much of the agency’s authority. One Republican, Susan Collins of Maine, crossed party lines to vote against Mr. Pruitt, while two Democrats, Joe Manchin III of West Virginia and Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, both from   states where voters generally oppose environmental rules, voted for him. Democrats railed all night on the Senate floor against Mr. Pruitt and urged Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, to delay the confirmation vote until after next Tuesday, when the Oklahoma attorney general’s office is under order to release about 3, 000 of Mr. Pruitt’s emails related to his communications with the fossil fuel industry. But the effort did little but deprive Democrats of sleep. Democrats, environmental groups and even current E. P. A. employees have harshly criticized Mr. Pruitt’s record of fighting the mission of the agency he will now lead, as well as his close ties with the fossil fuel industry he will now regulate. Both opponents and supporters of Mr. Pruitt’s say he is well positioned to carry out Mr. Trump’s campaign trail promises to dismantle the agency and slash its ranks of employees. Mr. Trump vowed to “get rid” of the agency “in almost every form. ” A 2014 investigation by The Times found that energy lobbyists drafted letters for Mr. Pruitt to send, on state stationery, to the E. P. A. outlining the economic hardship of the environmental rules. Many of the coal, oil and gas companies represented by those lobbyists were also some his largest campaign contributors. Mr. Pruitt also worked jointly with those companies in filing multiple lawsuits against major E. P. A. regulations. Democrats say the emails to be released on Tuesday could reveal more, and possibly disqualifying, information about those relationships. “I reminded my colleagues that the release of these documents could be imminent and that we would be wise wait to vote on Mr. Pruitt’s nomination until we had the opportunity to review them  —   and shame on us if we didn’t,” said Senator Thomas R. Carper of Delaware, the ranking Democrat on the Environment and Public Works Committee. “Mr. Pruitt has been nominated by a man who, as a nominee, as a   and now as president, has made clear his goals to degrade and destroy the E. P. A. ,” Mr. Carper said. “Like many things President Trump says, we ask ourselves, ‘Did he mean it?’ With the nomination of Mr. Pruitt, it’s clear he did. ” For many Republicans, that appears to be part of Mr. Pruitt’s appeal. During the Obama administration, Mr. McConnell became a leading opponent of the president’s climate change agenda, particularly its centerpiece, a set of E. P. A. regulations intended to shut down heavily polluting   power plants and replace them with wind and solar power. Those rules, if enacted, could disproportionately hurt the economy of Mr. McConnell’s   state. Mr. Pruitt, who has expressed skepticism about   global warming, has been a key architect of the legal battle to overturn the rules. “Pruitt is just the candidate we need at the helm of the E. P. A. ,” Mr. McConnell said. “He’s exceptionally qualified. He’s dedicated to environmental protection. And, as someone with state government experience, he understands the   consequences of E. P. A. actions and knows that balance is the key to making policies that are sustainable over the  . ” Mr. McConnell added: “We should confirm him. Doing so will represent another positive change in Washington that can give hope to families in Kentucky and across the nation who are still recovering from the last eight years. ” Within days of Mr. Pruitt’s   Mr. Trump is expected to sign one or more executive orders aimed at undoing Mr. Obama’s climate change policies, people familiar with the White House’s plans said. While it will be impossible to undo the rules immediately, the presidential signatures would give Mr. Pruitt his marching orders to commence the   to   legal process of withdrawing the   climate rules and replacing them with looser, more   rules. It is also possible that under Mr. Pruitt, the Trump administration could pursue the bold legal strategy of challenging the underlying legal requirement that the federal government regulate   greenhouse gases in the first place. Already, Mr. Pruitt has begun work to reshape the environmental agency. Among the candidates he has interviewed for top positions are several former senior staff members in the office of his fellow Oklahoma Republican, Senator James M. Inhofe, who has become known as Congress’s most prominent denier of the science of global warming.	1
451	THE IDIOTBy Elif Batuman423 pages. Penguin Press. $27. Love, as Thomas Pynchon wrote, reviewing Gabriel García Márquez’s novel “Love in the Time of Cholera” in The New York Times Book Review in 1988 and quoting Mickey and Sylvia’s 1956 hit single, love is strange. Elif Batuman’s first novel, “The Idiot,” is in part about the unlikely and consuming crush that Selin, the daughter of Turkish immigrants, develops on an older mathematics student from Hungary during her freshman year at Harvard. It is unclear, for hundreds of pages, whether this crush is requited. Meanwhile the reader, palm crushed into forehead, thinks, “Poor Selin, what are you doing to yourself?” “The Idiot” is set in 1995. Blues Traveler plays on Discmans. Mixtapes are still units of emotional currency. Students type with green cursors on black screens. Email is new, and Selin intuits its power. “Each message contained the one that had come before, and so your own words came back to you  —   all the words you threw out, they came back,” Batuman writes. “It was like the story of your relations with others, the story of the intersection of your life with other lives, was constantly being recorded and updated and you could check it at any time. ” Anyone who has followed Batuman’s work will not be surprised to learn that Selin first falls for Ivan, the Hungarian student, because she adores his email messages. Batuman is a language freak and geek. You can imagine one of her characters becoming attracted to someone, as did a woman in Norman Rush’s last novel, “Subtle Bodies,” because he was “verbal looking. ” Herself the daughter of Turkish immigrants and a graduate of Harvard, Batuman is a staff writer at The New Yorker and the author of “The Possessed: Adventures With Russian Books and the People Who Read Them” (2010). That book was a witty and melancholy tour de force about reading and love and the pleasures of travel as against tourism. That same voice is poured into “The Idiot. ” It’s memorable to witness Selin, via Batuman, absorb the world around her. Each paragraph is a small anthology of   observations. Only Batuman would send a character in search of new clothes and have her think, “what was ‘Cinderella,’ if not an allegory for the fundamental unhappiness of shoe shopping?” Selin notes the “death roar” of an institutional toilet. She observes how, lighting a cigarette, “when the flame came into contact with the paper, it made a sound like the needle coming down on a record player. ” Small pleasures will have to sustain you over the long haul of this novel. “The Idiot” builds little narrative or emotional force. It is like a beautiful neon sign made without a plug. No glow is cast. We’re told why Selin falls for Ivan. He gives good email. He is also, as one of her friends puts it, “a    Hungarian guy who stares at everyone like he’s trying to see through their souls. ” He’s Ivan the enfant terrible. Selin tells us about the force of her longing. “Every sound, every syllable that reached me,” she says, “I wanted to filter through his consciousness. ” But we never feel this longing in our bones. I’m reminded of the acting coach’s dictum that it’s not important that the actor cry it’s important that the audience does. After 100 pages, I was done with Ivan and wanted Selin to be done, too. I wished, as if she were an avatar in a video game, to point her in a different direction. Selin is not done with him. The summer after her freshman year, she travels to the Hungarian countryside to teach English and perhaps to see him on weekends. She consumes a lot of food with sour cream in it. She judges a contest to see which students have the best legs. She frets. Sexual heat is at a minimum. This is too bad, because Batuman has a rich sense of the details of human attachment and lust. Watching Ivan dig into his pockets for coins, for example, Selin thinks: “An amazing sight, someone you’re infatuated with trying to fish something out of a jeans pocket. ” That line beamed me back to my own freshman year at college. “The Idiot”  —   at the rate Batuman is burning through the titles of Dostoyevsky novels, her next one will be called “Netochka Nezvanova”  —   reminded me of Martin Amis’s complaint about “Pride and Prejudice. ” That novel’s only flaw, he said, “is the absence of a   sex scene between Elizabeth and Darcy. ” There are two things I admire about this novel. One is the touching sense, here as in everything Batuman writes, that books are life. Selin is, convincingly and only slightly pretentiously, the sort of person who buys an overcoat because it reminds her of Gogol’s. She likes learning Spanish because “the donkey had a place in the national literature. ” She delivers this writing advice, after hearing a story about a host placing an unsettling stuffed weasel in a guest room to keep someone company: “If you really wanted to be a writer, you didn’t send away the weasel. ” I also liked Selin’s determination to be “someone trying to live a life unmarred by laziness, cowardice, and conformity. ” She’s an interesting human who, very much like this wry but distant novel, never becomes an enveloping one. Fiction, like love, is strange.	1

22	WASHINGTON  —   Weeks before President Trump’s inauguration, his national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn, discussed American sanctions against Russia, as well as areas of possible cooperation, with that country’s ambassador to the United States, according to current and former American officials. Throughout the discussions, the message Mr. Flynn conveyed to the ambassador, Sergey I. Kislyak  —   that the Obama administration was Moscow’s adversary and that relations with Russia would change under Mr. Trump  —   was unambiguous and highly inappropriate, the officials said. The accounts of the conversations raise the prospect that Mr. Flynn violated a law against private citizens’ engaging in diplomacy, and directly contradict statements made by Trump advisers. They have said that Mr. Flynn spoke to Mr. Kislyak a few days after Christmas merely to arrange a phone call between President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and Mr. Trump after the inauguration. But current and former American officials said that conversation  —   which took place the day before the Obama administration imposed sanctions on Russia over accusations that it used cyberattacks to help sway the election in Mr. Trump’s favor  —   ranged far beyond the logistics of a   phone call. And they said it was only one in a series of contacts between the two men that began before the election and also included talk of cooperating in the fight against the Islamic State, along with other issues. The officials said that Mr. Flynn had never made explicit promises of sanctions relief, but that he had appeared to leave the impression it would be possible. Mr. Flynn could not immediately be reached for comment about the conversations, details of which were first reported by The Washington Post. Despite Mr. Flynn’s earlier denials, his spokesman told the Post that “while he had no recollection of discussing sanctions, he couldn’t be certain that the topic never came up. ” During the Christmas week conversation, he urged Mr. Kislyak to keep the Russian government from retaliating over the coming sanctions  —   it was an open secret in Washington that they were in the works  —   by telling him that whatever the Obama administration did could be undone, said the officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were discussing classified material. Days before Mr. Trump’s inauguration, Vice   Mike Pence also denied that Mr. Flynn had discussed sanctions with Mr. Kislyak. He said he had personally spoken to Mr. Flynn, who assured him that the conversation was an informal chat that began with Mr. Flynn extending Christmas wishes. “They did not discuss anything having to do with the United States’ decision to expel diplomats or impose censure against Russia,” Mr. Pence said on the CBS News program “Face the Nation. ” Some officials regarded the conversation as a potential violation of the Logan Act, which prohibits private citizens from negotiating with foreign governments in disputes involving the American government, according to one current and one former American official familiar with the case. Federal officials who have read the transcript of the call were surprised by Mr. Flynn’s comments, since he would have known that American eavesdroppers closely monitor such calls. They were even more surprised that Mr. Trump’s team publicly denied that the topics of conversation included sanctions. The call is the latest example of how Mr. Trump’s advisers have come under scrutiny from American counterintelligence officials. The F. B. I. is also investigating Mr. Trump’s former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort Carter Page, a businessman and former foreign policy adviser to the campaign and Roger Stone, a longtime Republican operative. Prosecutions in these types of cases are rare, and the law is murky, particularly around people involved in presidential transitions. The officials who had read the transcripts acknowledged that while the conversation warranted investigation, it was unlikely, by itself, to lead to charges against a sitting national security adviser. But, at the very least, openly engaging in policy discussions with a foreign government during a presidential transition is a remarkable breach of protocol. The norm has been for the  ’s team to respect the sitting president, and to limit discussions with foreign governments to pleasantries. Any policy discussions, even with allies, would ordinarily be kept as vague as possible. “It’s largely shunned, period. But one cannot rule it out with an ally like the U. K.,” said Derek Chollet, who was part of the Obama transition in 2008 and then served in senior roles at the State Department, White House and Pentagon. “But it’s way out of bounds when the said country is an adversary, and one that has been judged to have meddled in the election,” he added. “It’s just hard to imagine anyone having a substantive discussion with an adversary, particularly if it’s about trying to be reassuring. ”	1
298	(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the  .) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. President Trump issued new guidelines to rescind   protections for transgender students, overruling his education secretary, who had pushed to keep them in place. The issue caused a cabinet rift between Betsy DeVos, the education secretary, and Jeff Sessions, the attorney general. Mr. Sessions was adamant that the administration move quickly to reverse an order from the Obama administration that allowed transgender students to use the restroom of their gender identity. Ms. DeVos, faced with the choice of resigning or defying the president, dropped her objections, according to insiders. _____ 2. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson is en route to Mexico, accompanied by John Kelly, the secretary of Homeland Security, for talks with Mexican officials on trade, security, aid and migration. The meetings are not expected to be pleasant, as Mexico reels from the announcement, a day earlier, of Mr. Trump’s tough new immigration policies. Today’s episode of our podcast, The Daily, focuses on the new immigration policies. Listen from a computer, on an iOS device or on an Android device. _____ 3. Most of the activists protesting the Dakota Access oil pipeline left their longtime encampment under orders from the state. Some lit fires as they departed. A handful remained and there were several arrests by nightfall. The protesters had been camped out near the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation in North Dakota for months, calling for a halt to construction of the nearly completed pipeline. They say it will imperil the water supply. Construction resumed this month with Mr. Trump’s backing, and barring court intervention, oil could be flowing through the pipeline by this spring. _____ 4. We unearthed a lawsuit that reveals an A. T. F. operation that existed on a murky frontier  —   between investigating smuggling and being complicit in it. Records and interviews show that agents from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms who were fighting cigarette smuggling filled a secret bank account with millions from their own    operation  —   which revolved around cigarette sales. Tobacco farmers who say they were swindled out of $24 million filed a lawsuit that has been kept nearly entirely sealed for years. _____ 5. The U. S. commander for the Middle East said more American troops would speed the campaign against the Islamic State in Syria. In recent weeks, the Iraqi government recaptured the eastern part of Mosul, a major victory against the Islamic State in Iraq. A New York Times reporter describes a city torn in half. Military figures carry a great deal of weight in the Trump administration, with veterans in the top three security jobs, all from a generation of leaders from the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. _____ 6. The Supreme Court ruled for the defendant in a Texas death penalty case because of testimony laced with “a particularly noxious strain of racial prejudice. ” The court required a new sentencing for the defendant, Duane Buck, who was convicted of the murder of a former girlfriend and one of her friends. The testimony came from a psychologist who said black defendants were more dangerous than white ones. _____ 7. The president of Iceland ignited an international debate with a joke about pineapple on pizza. Gudni Thorlacius Johannesson, above right, was visiting a high school when he joked that the topping should be outlawed. Internet outrage ensued, and it reached such proportions that the president issued a statement on Facebook. He wrote that he was glad he did not have the power to make such a law, adding that for pizzas, he recommends seafood. _____ 8. We’re continuing our   of the best of   comedy. The comics are taking on the usual suspects, like the pope, the royal family and our president. Here’s one from James Corden: “I bet it’s hard to play golf with Trump, because every time he misses a putt, Kellyanne Conway comes out and explains that he actually won that hole. ” And our brave tech writer embarked on a daring experiment: ignoring news about the president for a week, which was harder than it sounds. “Even when I found   news, much of it was interleaved with Trump news, so the overall effect was something like trying to bite into a    cake without getting any fruit or nuts,” he wrote. _____ 9. It’s London Fashion Week, and our critic says the runways are all about “the kicky, fearless exuberance of youth,” in keeping with the city’s reputation among designers. While New York has sheer numbers, Paris has high art and Milan has big business, London is known for ingenuity. “I think youth culture starts here,” Donatella Versace said. “British people have more courage than the others. ” _____ 10. Finally, scientists announced a remarkable discovery: a dwarf star that has not one but seven   planets that could potentially harbor life. “I think that we have made a crucial step toward finding if there is life out there,” an astronomer said. _____ Photographs may appear out of order for some readers.

162	President Trump on Thursday announced his new nominee for labor secretary, Alexander Acosta, during a news conference at the White House. Following is a transcript of that event, as prepared by the Federal News Service. For more coverage, read our live analysis. TRUMP: Thank you very much. I just wanted to begin by mentioning that the nominee for secretary of the Department of Labor will be Mr. Alex Acosta. He has a law degree from Harvard Law School, was a great student former clerk for Justice Samuel Alito. And he has had a tremendous career. He’s a member and has been a member of the National Labor Relations Board, and has been through Senate confirmation three times, confirmed did very, very well. And so Alex, I’ve wished him the best. We just spoke. And he’s going to be  —   I think he’ll be a tremendous secretary of labor. And also as you probably heard just a little while ago, Mick Mulvaney, former congressman, has just been approved weeks late, I have to say that, weeks, weeks late, Office of Management and Budget. And he will be I think a fantastic addition. Paul Singer just left. As you know, Paul was very much involved with the   or as they say, “never Trump. ” And Paul just left and he’s given us his total support. And it’s all about unification. We’re unifying the party and hopefully we’re going to be able to unify the country. It’s very important to me. I’ve been talking about that for a long time. It’s very, very important to me. So I want to thank Paul Singer for being here and for coming up to the office. He was a very strong opponent, and now he’s a very strong ally. And I appreciate that. I think I’ll say a few words, and then we’ll take some questions. And I had this time. We’ve been negotiating a lot of different transactions to save money on contracts that were terrible, including airplane contracts that were out of control and late and terrible just absolutely catastrophic in terms of what was happening. And we’ve done some really good work. We’re very proud of that. And then right after that, you prepare yourselves, we’ll do some questions, unless you have enough questions. That’s always a possibility. I’m here today to update the American people on the incredible progress that has been made in the last four weeks since my inauguration. We have made incredible progress. I don’t think there’s ever been a president elected who in this short period of time has done what we’ve done. A new Rasmussen poll, in fact  —   because the people get it  —   much of the media doesn’t get it. They actually get it, but they don’t write it. Let’s put it that way. But a new Rasmussen poll just came out just a very short while ago, and it has our approval rating at 55 percent and going up. The stock market has hit record numbers, as you know. And there has been a tremendous surge of optimism in the business world, which is  —   to me means something much different than it used to. It used to mean, “Oh, that’s good. ” Now it means, “That’s good for jobs. ” Very different. Plants and factories are already starting to move back into the United States, and big league  —   Ford, General Motors, so many of them. I’m making this presentation directly to the American people, with the media present, which is an honor to have you. This morning, because many of our nation’s reporters and folks will not tell you the truth, and will not treat the wonderful people of our country with the respect that they deserve. And I hope going forward we can be a little bit  —   a little bit different, and maybe get along a little bit better, if that’s possible. Maybe it’s not, and that’s OK, too. TRUMP: Unfortunately, much of the media in Washington, D. C. along with New York, Los Angeles in particular, speaks not for the people, but for the special interests and for those profiting off a very, very obviously broken system. The press has become so dishonest that if we don’t talk about, we are doing a tremendous disservice to the American people. Tremendous disservice. We have to talk to find out what’s going on, because the press honestly is out of control. The level of dishonesty is out of control. I ran for president to present the citizens of our country. I am here to change the broken system so it serves their families and their communities well. I am talking  —   and really talking on this very entrenched power structure, and what we’re doing is we’re talking about the power structure we’re talking about its entrenchment. As a result, the media is going through what they have to go through too often times distort  —   not all the time  —   and some of the media is fantastic, I have to say  —   they’re honest and fantastic. But much of it is not a  —   the distortion  —   and we’ll talk about it, you’ll be able to ask me questions about it. But we’re not going to let it happen, because I’m here again, to take my message straight to the people. As you know, our administration inherited many problems across government and across the economy. To be honest, I inherited a mess. It’s a mess. At home and abroad, a mess. Jobs are pouring out of the country you see what’s going on with all of the companies leaving our country, going to Mexico and other places, low pay, low wages, mass instability overseas, no matter where you look. The Middle East is a disaster. North Korea  —   we’ll take care of it folks we’re going to take care of it all. I just want to let you know, I inherited a mess. Beginning on day one, our administration went to work to tackle these challenges. On foreign affairs, we’ve already begun enormously productive talks with many foreign leaders, much of it you’ve covered, to move forward towards stability, security and peace in the most troubled regions of the world, which there are many. We have had great conversations with the United Kingdom, and meetings. Israel, Mexico, Japan, China and Canada, really, really productive conversations. I would say far more productive than you would understand. We’ve even developed a new council with Canada to promote women’s business leaders and entrepreneurs. It’s very important to me, very important to my daughter Ivanka. I have directed our defense community headed by our great general, now Secretary Mattis. He’s over there now working very hard to submit a plan for the defeat of ISIS, a group that celebrates the murder and torture of innocent people in large sections of the world. It used to be a small group, now it’s in large sections of the world. They’ve spread like cancer. ISIS has spread like cancer  —   another mess I inherited. And we have imposed new sanctions on the nation of Iran, whose totally taken advantage of our previous administration, and they’re the world’s top sponsor of terrorism, and we’re not going to stop until that problem is properly solved. And it’s not properly solved now, it’s one of the worst agreements I’ve ever seen drawn by anybody. I’ve ordered plan to begin building for the massive rebuilding of the United States military. Had great support from the Senate, I’ve had great from Congress, generally. We’ve pursued this rebuilding in the hopes that we will never have to use this military, and I will tell you that is my  —   I would be so happy if we never had to use it. But our country will never have had a military like the military we’re about to build and rebuild. We have the greatest people on earth in our military, but they don’t have the right equipment and their equipment is old. I used it I talked about it at every stop. Depleted, it’s depleted  —   it won’t be depleted for long. And I think one of the reason I’m standing here instead of other people is that frankly, I talked about we have to have a strong military. We have to have a strong law enforcement also. So we do not go abroad in the search of war, we really are searching for peace, but its peace through strength. At home, we have begun the monumental task of returning the government back to the people on a scale not seen in many, many years. In each of these actions, I’m keeping my promises to the American people. These are campaign promises. Some people are so surprised that we’re having strong borders. Well, that’s what I’ve been talking about for a year and a half, strong borders. They’re so surprised, oh, he having strong borders, well that’s what I’ve been talking about to the press and to everybody else. One promise after another after years of politicians lying to you to get elected. They lied to the American people in order to get elected. Some of the things I’m doing probably aren’t popular but they’re necessary for security and for other reasons. And then coming to Washington and pursuing their own interests which is more important to many politicians. I’m here following through on what I pledged to do. That’s all I’m doing. I put it out before the American people, got 306 Electoral College votes. I wasn’t supposed to get 222. They said there’s no way to get 222, 230’s impossible. 270 which you need, that was laughable. We got 306 because people came out and voted like they’ve never seen before so that’s the way it goes. I guess it was the biggest Electoral College win since Ronald Reagan. In other words, the media’s trying to attack our administration because they know we are following through on pledges that we made and they’re not happy about it for whatever reason. And  —   but a lot of people are happy about it. In fact, I’ll be in Melbourne, Florida five o’clock on Saturday and I heard  —   just heard that the crowds are massive that want to be there. I turn on the T. V. open the newspapers and I see stories of chaos. Chaos. Yet it is the exact opposite. This administration is running like a   machine, despite the fact that I can’t get my cabinet approved. And they’re outstanding people like Senator Dan Coats who’s there, one of the most respected men of the Senate. He can’t get approved. How do you not approve him? He’s been a colleague  —   highly respected. Brilliant guy, great guy, everybody knows it. We’re waiting for approval. So we have a wonderful group of people that’s working very hard, that’s being very much misrepresented about and we can’t let that happen. So, if the Democrats who have  —   all you have to do is look at where they are right now. The only thing they can do is delay because they screwed things up royally, believe me. Let me list to you some of the things that we’ve done in just a short period of time. I just got here. And I got here with no cabinet. Again, each of these actions is a promise I made to the American people. I’ll go over just some of them and we have a lot happening next week and in the weeks  —   in the weeks coming. We’ve withdrawn from the   disaster known as Trans Pacific Partnership. We’re going to make trade deals but we’re going to have one on one deals, bilateral. We’re going to have one on one deals. We’ve directed the elimination of regulations that undermine manufacturing and call for expedited approval of the permits needed for America and American infrastructure and that means plant, equipment, roads, bridges, factories. People take 10, 15, 20 years to get disapproved for a factory. They go in for a permit, it’s many, many years. And then at the end of the process  —   they spend 10s of millions of dollars on nonsense and at the end of the process, they get rejected. Now, they may be rejected with me but it’s going to be a quick rejection. Not going to take years. But mostly it’s going to be an acceptance. We want plants built and we want factories built and we want the jobs. We don’t want the jobs going to other countries. We’ve imposed a hiring freeze on nonessential federal workers. We’ve imposed a temporary moratorium on new federal regulations. We’ve issued a   new rule that says for each one new regulation, two old regulations must be eliminated. Makes sense. Nobody’s ever seen regulations like we have. You go to other countries and you look at indexes (ph) they have and you say “let me see your regulations” and they’re fraction, just a tiny fraction of what we have. And I want regulations because I want safety, I want environmental  —   all environmental situations to be taken properly care of. It’s very important to me. But you don’t need four or five or six regulations to take care of the same thing. We’ve stood up for the men and women of law enforcement, directing federal agencies to ensure they are protected from crimes of violence. We’ve directed the creation of a task force for reducing violent crime in America, including the horrendous situation  —   take a look at Chicago and others, taking place right now in our inner cities. Horrible. We’ve ordered the Department of Homeland Security and Justice to coordinate on a plan to destroy criminal cartels coming into the United States with drugs. We’re becoming a drug infested nation. Drugs are becoming cheaper than candy bars. We are not going to let it happen any longer. We’ve undertaken the most substantial border security measures in a generation to keep our nation and our tax dollars safe. And are now in the process of beginning to build a promised wall on the southern border, met with general  —   now Secretary Kelly yesterday and we’re starting that process. And the wall is going to be a great wall and it’s going to be a wall negotiated by me. The price is going to come down just like it has on everything else I’ve negotiated for the government. And we are going to have a wall that works, not gonna have a wall like they have now which is either nonexistent or a joke. We’ve ordered a crackdown on sanctuary cities that refuse to comply with federal law and that harbor criminal aliens, and we have ordered an end to the policy of catch and release on the border. No more release. No matter who you are, release. We have begun a nationwide effort to remove criminal aliens, gang members, drug dealers and others who pose a threat to public safety. We are saving American lives every single day. The court system has not made it easy for us. And are even creating a new office in Homeland Security dedicated to the forgotten American victims of illegal immigrant violence, which there are many. We have taken decisive action to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of our country. No parts are necessary and constitutional actions were blocked by judges, in my opinion, incorrect, and unsafe ruling. Our administration is working night and day to keep you safe, including reporters safe. And is vigorously defending this lawful order. I will not back down from defending our country. I got elected on defense of our country. I keep my campaign promises, and our citizens will be very happy when they see the result. They already are, I can tell you that. Extreme vetting will be put in place and it already is in place in many places. In fact, we had to go quicker than we thought because of the bad decision we received from a circuit that has been overturned at a record number. I have heard 80 percent, I find that hard to believe, that is just a number I heard, that they are overturned 80 percent of the time. I think that circuit is  —   that circuit is in chaos and that circuit is frankly in turmoil. But we are appealing that, and we are going further. We’re issuing a new executive action next week that will comprehensively protect our country. So we’ll be going along the one path and hopefully winning that, at the same time we will be issuing a new and very comprehensive order to protect our people. That will be done sometime next week, toward the beginning or middle at the latest part. We have also taken steps to begin construction of the Keystone Pipeline and Dakota Access Pipelines. Thousands and thousands of jobs, and put new buy American measures in place to require American steel for American pipelines. In other words, they build a pipeline in this country, and we use the powers of government to make that pipeline happen, we want them to use American steel. And they are willing to do that, but nobody ever asked before I came along. Even this order was drawn and they didn’t say that. TRUMP: And I’m reading the order, I’m saying, why aren’t we using American steel? And they said, that’s a good idea, we put it in. To drain the swamp of corruption in Washington, D. C. I’ve started by imposing a   lobbying ban on White House officials and a lifetime ban on lobbying for a foreign government. We’ve begun preparing to repeal and replace Obamacare. Obamacare is a disaster, folks. It is’s disaster. I know you can say, oh, Obamacare. I mean, they fill up our alleys with people that you wonder how they get there, but they are not the Republican people our that representatives are representing. So we’ve begun preparing to repeal and replace Obamacare, and are deep in the midst of negotiations on a very historic tax reform to bring our jobs back, to bring our jobs back to this country. Big league. It’s already happening. But big league. I’ve also worked to install a cabinet over the delays and obstruction of Senate Democrats. You’ve seen what they’ve done over the last long number of years. That will be one of the great cabinets ever assembled in American history. You look at Rex Tillerson. He’s out there negotiating right now. General Mattis I mentioned before, General Kelly. We have great, great people. Mick is with us now. We have great people. Among their responsibilities will be ending the bleeding of jobs from our country and negotiating fair trade deals for our citizens. Now look, fair trade. Not free, fair. If a country is taking advantage of us, not going to let that happen anymore. Every country takes advantage of us almost. I may be able to find a couple that don’t. But for the most part, that would be a very tough job for me to do. Jobs have already started to surge. Since my election, Ford announced it will abandon its plans to build a new factory in Mexico, and will instead invest $700 million in Michigan, creating many, many jobs. Fiat Chrysler announced it will invest $1 billion in Ohio and Michigan, creating 2, 000 new American jobs. They were with me a week ago. You know you were here. General Motors likewise committed to invest billions of dollars in its American manufacturing operation, keeping many jobs here that were going to leave. And if I didn’t get elected, believe me, they would have left. And these jobs and these things that I’m announcing would never have come here. Intel just announced that it will move ahead with a new plant in Arizona that probably was never going to move ahead with. And that will result in at least 10, 000 American jobs. Walmart announced it will create 10, 000 jobs in the United States just this year because of our various plans and initiatives. There will be many, many more, many more, these are a few that we’re naming. Other countries have been taking advantage of us for decades  —   decades, and decades, and decades, folks. And we’re not going to let that happen anymore. Not going to let it happen. And one more thing, I have kept my promise to the American people by nominating a justice of the United States Supreme Court, Judge Neil Gorsuch, who is from my list of 20, and who will be a true defender of our laws and our Constitution, highly respected, should get the votes from the Democrats. You may not see that. But he’ll get there one way or the other. But he should get there the   way, and he should get those votes. This last month has represented an unprecedented degree of action on behalf of the great citizens of our country. Again, I say it. There has never been a presidency that’s done so much in such a short period of time. And we have not even started the big work yet. That starts early next week. Some very big things are going to be announced next week. So we are just getting started. We will be giving a speech, as I said, in Melbourne, Florida, at 5:00 p. m. I hope to see you there. And with that, I just say, God bless America, and let’s take some questions. Mara (ph) Mara (ph) go ahead. You were cut off pretty violently at our last news conference. QUESTION: ( ) TRUMP: Mike Flynn is a fine person, and I asked for his resignation. He respectfully gave it. He is a man who there was a certain amount of information given to Vice President Pence, who is with us today. And I was not happy with the way that information was given. He didn’t have to do that, because what he did wasn’t wrong  —   what he did in terms of the information he saw. What was wrong was the way that other people, including yourselves in this room, were given that information, because that was classified information that was given illegally. That’s the real problem. And, you know, you can talk all you want about Russia, which was all a, you know, fake news, fabricated deal, to try and make up for the loss of the Democrats and the press plays right into it. In fact, I saw a couple of the people that were supposedly involved with all of this  —   that they know nothing about it they weren’t in Russia they never made a phone call to Russia they never received a phone call. It’s all fake news. It’s all fake news. The nice thing is, I see it starting to turn, where people are now looking at the illegal  —   I think it’s very important  —   the illegal, giving out classified information. It was  —   and let me just tell you, it was given out like so much. I’ll give you an example. I called, as you know, Mexico. It was a very, very confidential, classified call. But I called Mexico. And in calling Mexico, I figured, oh, well that’s  —   I spoke to the president of Mexico I had a good call. All of a sudden, it’s out there for the world to see. It’s supposed to be secret. It’s supposed to be either confidential or classified, in that case. Same thing with Australia. All of a sudden, people are finding out exactly what took place. The same thing happened with respect to General Flynn. Everybody saw this. And I’m saying  —   the first thing I thought of when I heard about it is: How does the press get this information that’s classified? How do they do it? You know why? Because it’s an illegal process and the press should be ashamed of themselves. But more importantly, the people that gave out the information to the press should be ashamed of themselves, really ashamed. Yes, go ahead. QUESTION: ( ) TRUMP: Because when I looked at the information, I said, “I don’t think he did anything wrong if anything, he did something right. ” He was coming into office. He looked at the information. He said, “Huh, that’s fine. ” That’s what they’re supposed to do. They’re supposed to  —   he didn’t just call Russia. He called and spoke to both ways, I think there were    countries. He’s doing the job. You know, he was doing his job. The thing is, he didn’t tell our vice president properly, and then he said he didn’t remember. So either way, it wasn’t very satisfactory to me. And I have somebody that I think will be outstanding for the position. And that also helps, I think, in the making of my decision. But he didn’t tell the vice president of the United States the facts. And then he didn’t remember. And that just wasn’t acceptable to me. Yes? QUESTION: (inaudible) clarification here. During your campaign, did anyone from your team (inaudible) Russian government or Russian intelligence? And if so, what was the nature of those conversations (inaudible)? TRUMP: The failing New York Times wrote a big, long   story yesterday. And it was very much discredited, as you know. It was  —   it’s a joke. And the people mentioned in the story, I notice they were on television today saying they never even spoke to Russia. They weren’t even a part, really  —   I mean, they were such a minor part. They  —   I hadn’t spoken to them. I think the one person  —   I don’t think I’ve ever spoken to him. I don’t think I’ve ever met him. And he actually said he was a very   member of I think a committee for a short period of time. I don’t think I ever met him. Now, it’s possible that I walked into a room and he was sitting there, but I don’t think I ever met him. I didn’t talk to him ever. And he thought it was a joke. The other person said he never spoke to Russia never received a call. Look at his phone records, et cetera, et cetera. And the other person, people knew that he represented various countries, but I don’t think he represented Russia, but knew that he represented various countries. That’s what he does. I mean, people know that. That’s Mr. Manafort, who’s  —   by the way, who’s by the way a respected man. He’s a respected man. But I think he represented the Ukraine or Ukraine government or somebody, but everybody  —   people knew that. Everybody knew that. So, these people  —   and he said that he has absolutely nothing to do and never has with Russia. And he said that very forcefully. I saw his statement. He said it very forcefully. Most of the papers don’t print it because that’s not good for their stories. TRUMP: So the three people that they talked about all totally deny it. And I can tell you, speaking for myself, I own nothing in Russia. I have no loans in Russia. I don’t have any deals in Russia. President Putin called me up very nicely to congratulate me on the win of the election. He then, called me up extremely nicely to congratulate me on the inauguration, which was terrific. But so did many other leaders, almost all other leaders from almost all of the country. So that’s the extent. Russia is fake news. Russia  —   this is fake news put out by the media. The real news is the fact that people, probably from the Obama administration because they’re there, because we have our new people going in place, right now. As you know, Mike Pompeo has  —   has now taken control of the CIA, James Comey at FBI, Dan Coats is waiting to be approved, I mean he is a senator and a highly respected one and he’s still waiting to be approved. But our new people are going in. And just while you’re at it, because you mentioned this, Wall Street Journal did a story today that was almost as disgraceful as the failing New York Time’s story, yesterday. And it talked about  —   these are (ph) front page. So director of national intelligence just put out, acting a statement, any suggestion that the United States intelligence community, this was just given to us, is withholding information and not providing the best possible intelligence to the president and his national security team is not true. So they took this front page story out of The Wall Street Journal top and they just wrote the story that its not true. And I’ll tell you something, I’ll be honest, because I sort of enjoy this back and forth that I guess I have all my life but I’ve never seen more dishonest media than frankly, the political media. I thought the financial media was much better, much more honest. But I will say that, I never get phone calls from the media. How did they write a story like that in The Wall Street Journal without asking me or how did they write a story in The New York Times, put it on front page? That was like the story they wrote about the women and me, front page, big massive story. And it was nasty and then they called, they said we never said that, we like Mr. Trump. They called up my office, we like Mr. Trump, we never said that. And it was totally  —   they totally misrepresented those very wonderful women, I have to tell you, totally misrepresented. I said give us the retraction. They never gave us a retraction and frankly, I then went on to other things. OK, go ahead. QUESTION: ( ) said today that you have big intellectual margins (inaudible) 300 or more (ph) or 350 (ph) electoral (ph) votes. President Obama about 365 ( ). (CROSSTALK) TRUMP: Yeah. QUESTION: Obama ( ) 426 on ( ). So why should Americans. .. (CROSSTALK) TRUMP: . ..I’m skipping that information, I don’t know, I was just given (ph) we had a very, very big margin. QUESTION: ( ) why should Americans trust you ( ) the information ( )? TRUMP: Well, I don’t know, I was given that information. I was given  —   I actually, I’ve seen that information around. But it was a very substantial victory, do you agree with that? OK thank you, that’s. .. (CROSSTALK) TRUMP: Go ahead Sir, yes? QUESTION: Can you tell us in determining that Lieutenant General Flynn did  —   whether there was no wrongdoing in your mind, what evidence was weighed? Did you ask for transcripts of these telephone intercepts with Russian officials, particularly the Ambassador Sergey Kislyak, who he was communicating with? What —   what evidence did you weigh to determine that there was no wrongdoing? Further to that, Sir, you said on a couple of locations this morning, you are going to aggressively pursue the source of these leaks. TRUMP: We are. QUESTION: Can we ask what you’re going to do and also, we’ve heard about a  —   a review of the intelligence community headed up by Steven Feinberg, what can you tell us about that? TRUMP: Well, first of all about that, we now have Dan Coats, hopefully soon, Mike Pompeo and James Comey and they’re in position so I hope that we’ll be able to straighten that out without using anybody else. The gentleman you mentioned is a very talented man, very successful man and he’s offered his services and you know, it’s something we may take advantage of. But I don’t think we’re need that at all because of the fact that you know, I think that we are gonna be able to straighten it out very easily on its own. As far as the general’s concerned, when I first heard about it, I said huh, that doesn’t sound wrong. My counsel came, Don McGahn, White House Counsel, and he told me and I asked him, he can speak very well for himself. He said he doesn’t think anything is wrong, you know, really didn’t think. It was really, what happened after that but he didn’t think anything was done wrong. I didn’t either because I waited a period of time and I started to think about it, I said “well I don’t see”  —   to me, he was doing the job. The information was provided by  —   who I don’t know, Sally Yates. And I was a little surprised because I said “doesn’t sound like he did anything wrong there. ” But he did something wrong with respect to the vice president and I thought that was not acceptable. As far as  —   as far as the actual making the call, fact I’ve watched various programs and I’ve read various articles where he was just doing his job. That was very normal. You know, first everybody got excited because they thought he did something wrong. After they thought about it, it turned out he was just doing his job. So  —   and I do. And by the way, with all of that being said, I do think he’s a fine man. QUESTION: Sir, if I could, on the leaks  —   on the leaks, sir. .. TRUMP: . ..Go ahead. Finish off then I’ll get you. QUESTION: I’m sorry. What will you do on the leaks? You’ve said twice today. .. TRUMP: . ..Yes, we’re looking at them very  —   very, very serious. I’ve gone to all of the folks in charge of the various agencies and we’re  —   I’ve actually called the Justice Department to look into the leaks. Those are criminal leaks. They’re put out by people either in agencies  —   I think you’ll see it stopping because now we have our people in. You know, again, we don’t have our people in because we can’t get them approved by the Senate. We just had Jeff Sessions approved. Injustice, as an example (ph). So, we are looking into that very seriously. It’s a criminal act. You know what I say, when I  —   when I was called out on Mexico, I was shocked because all this equipment, all this incredible phone equipment  —   when I was called out on Mexico, I was  —   honestly, I was really, really surprised. But I said “you know, it doesn’t make sense. That won’t happen” but that wasn’t that important a call, it was fine, I could show it to the world and he could show it to the world, the president who’s a very fine man, by the way. Same thing with Australia. I said “that’s terrible that it was leaked” but it wasn’t that important. But then I said to myself “what happens when I’m dealing with the problem of North Korea?” What happens when I’m dealing with the problems in the Middle East? Are you folks going to be reporting all of that very, very confidential information, very important, very  —   you know, I mean at the highest level? Are you going to be reporting about that too? So, I don’t want classified information getting out to the public and in a way that was almost a test. So I’m dealing with Mexico, I’m dealing with Argentina, we were dealing on this case with Mike Flynn. All this information gets put into the “Washington Post” and gets put into the “New York Times” and I’m saying “what’s going to happen when I’m dealing on the Middle East? What’s going to happen when I’m dealing with really, really important subjects like North Korea? We got to stop it. That’s why it’s a criminal penalty. QUESTION: I just want to get you to clarify this very important point. Can you say definitively that nobody on your campaign had any contacts with the Russians during the campaign? And on the leaks, is it fake news or are these real leaks? TRUMP: Well the leaks are real. You’re the one that wrote about them and reported them, I mean the leaks are real. You know what they said, you saw it and the leaks are absolutely real. The news is fake because so much of the news is fake. So one thing that I felt it was very important to do  —   and I hope we can correct it. Because there’s nobody I have more respect for  —   well, maybe a little bit but the reporters, good reporters. It’s very important to me and especially in this position. It’s very important. I don’t mind bad stories. I can handle a bad story better than anybody as long as it’s true and, you know, over a course of time, I’ll make mistakes and you’ll write badly and I’m OK with that. But I’m not OK when it is fake. I mean, I watch CNN, it’s so much anger and hatred and just the hatred. I don’t watch it any more because it’s very good  —   he’s saying no. It’s OK, Jim (ph). It’s OK, Jim (ph) you’ll have your chance. But I watch others too. You’re not the only one so don’t feel badly. But I think it should be straight. I think it should be  —   I think it would be frankly more interesting. I know how good everybody’s ratings are right now but I think that actually  —   I think that’d actually be better. People  —   I mean, you have a lower approval rate than Congress. I think that’s right. I don’t know, Peter (ph) is that one right? Because you know I think they have lower  —   I heard lower than Congress. But honestly, the public would appreciate it, I’d appreciate it  —   again, I don’t mind bad stories when it’s true but we have an administration where the Democrats are making it very difficult. TRUMP: I think we’re setting a record or close to a record in the time of approval of a cabinet. I mean, the numbers are crazy. When I’m looking, some of them had them approved immediately. I’m going forever and I still have a lot of people that we’re waiting for. And that’s all they’re doing, is delaying. And you look at Schumer and the mess that he’s got over there and they have nothing going. The only thing they can do is delay. And, you know, I think that they’d be better served by, you know, approving and making sure that they’re happy and everybody’s good. And sometimes  —   I mean, I know President Obama lost three or four, and you lose them on the way, and that’s OK. That’s fine. But I think it would  —   I think they would be much better served, John, if they just went through the process quickly. This is pure delay tactics. And they say it, and everybody understands it. Yeah, go ahead, Jimmy. QUESTION: ( ) TRUMP: Well, I had nothing to do with it. I have nothing to do with Russia. I told you, I have no deals there, I have no anything. Now, when WikiLeaks, which I had nothing to do with, comes out and happens to give, they’re not giving classified information. They’re giving stuff  —   what was said at an office about Hillary cheating on the debates. Which, by the way, nobody mentions. Nobody mentions that Hillary received the questions to the debates. Can you imagine  —   seriously  —   can you imagine if I received the questions? It would be the electric chair. OK, he should be put in the electric  —   you would even call for the reinstitution of the death penalty, OK. Maybe not you John. Yes? We’ll do you next Jim, I do you next( ph). QUESTION: ( ) clarify  —   TRUMP: Yes, yes, sure QUESTION: Did you direct Mike Flynn to discuss sanctions with the Russian ambassador  —   TRUMP: No, I didn’t. QUESTION:  —   prior to your  —   TRUMP: No, I didn’t. QUESTION:  —   inauguration. TRUMP: No, I didn’t. QUESTION: And then fired him  —   TRUMP: Excuse me. QUESTION: ( ) TRUMP: No, I fired him because of what he said to Mike Pence. Very simple. Mike was doing his job. He was calling countries and his counterparts. So, it certainly would have been OK with me if he did it. I would have directed him to do it if I thought he wasn’t doing it. I didn’t direct him, but I would have directed him because that’s his job. And it came out that way  —   and in all fairness, I watched Dr. Charles Krauthammer the other night say he was doing his job and I agreed with him. And since then, I’ve watched many other people say that. No, I didn’t direct him, but I would have directed him if he didn’t do it. OK? Jim? QUESTION: Thank you very much, and just for the record, we don’t hate you. I don’t hate you. TRUMP: OK. QUESTION: So, pass that along  —   TRUMP: Ask  —   ask Jeff Zucker how he got his job. OK? QUESTION: If I may follow up on some of the questions that have taken place so far here, sir  —   TRUMP: Well, that’s  —   well, you know, we do have other people. You do have other people and your ratings aren’t as good as some of the other people that are waiting. QUESTION: It’s pretty good right now, actually. TRUMP: OK, go ahead, John. QUESTION: If I may ask, sir, you said earlier that WikiLeaks was revealing information about the Hillary Clinton campaign during the election cycle. You welcomed that. At one time  —   TRUMP: I was OK with it. QUESTION:  —   you said  —   you said that you loved WikiLeaks. At another campaign press conference you called on the Russians to find the missing 30, 000  . I’m wondering, sir, if you  —   TRUMP: Well, she was actually missing 33 and then that got extended with a pile after that. QUESTION: Then( ph) your( ph) numbers( ph) were off too. TRUMP: No  —   no, but I did say 30. But it was actually higher than that. QUESTION: If  —   if I may ask you, sir, it  —   it sounds as though you do not have much credibility here when it comes to leaking if that is something that you encouraged during( ph) the campaign  —   TRUMP: OK, fair question. Ready? QUESTION: Well, if I may ask you that  —   TRUMP: No  —   no, but let me do one at a time. QUESTION: If I may as a follow up? TRUMP: Do you mind? QUESTION: Yes, sir. TRUMP: All right. So, in one case, you’re talking about highly classified information. In the other case, you’re talking about John Podesta saying bad things about the boss. I will say this, if John Podesta said that about me and he was working for me, I would have fired him so fast your head would have spun. He said terrible things about her. But it wasn’t classified information. But in one case, you’re talking about classified  —   regardless, if you look at the RNC, we had a very strong  —   at my suggestion  —   and I give Reince great credit for this  —   at my suggestion, because I know something about this world, I said I want a very strong defensive mechanism. I don’t want to be hacked. And we did that. And you have seen that they tried to hack us and they failed. The DNC did not do that. And if they did it, they could not have been hacked. But they were hacked and terrible things came in. And, you know, the only thing that I do think is unfair is some of the things were so  —   they were  —   when I heard some of those things I picked up the papers the next morning and said, oh, this is going to be front page, it wasn’t even in the papers. Again, if I had that happen to me, it would be the biggest story in the history of publishing or the head of newspapers. I would have been headline in every newspaper. I mean, think of it. They gave her the questions to a debate and she  —   and she should have reported herself. Why did Hillary Clinton announce that, “I’m sorry, but I have been given the questions to a debate or a town hall, and I feel that it’s inappropriate, and I want to turn in CNN for not doing a good job. ” QUESTION: And if I may follow up on that, just something that Jonathan Karl (ph) was asking you about. You said that the leaks are real, but the news is fake. I guess I don’t understand. It seems that there’s a disconnect there. If the information coming from those leaks is real, then how can the stories be fake? TRUMP: The reporting is fake. Look, look. .. (CROSSTALK) TRUMP: You know what it is? Here’s the thing. The public isn’t  —   you know, they read newspapers, they see television, they watch. They don’t know if it’s true or false because they’re not involved. I’m involved. I’ve been involved with this stuff all my life. But I’m involved. So I know when you’re telling the truth or when you’re not. I just see many, many untruthful things. And I’ll tell you what else I see. I see tone. You know the word “tone. ” The tone is such hatred. I’m really not a bad person, by the way. No, but the tone is such  —   I do get good ratings, you have to admit that  —   the tone is such hatred. I watched this morning a couple of the networks. And I have to say, Fox  Friends in the morning, they’re very honorable people. They’re very  —   not because they’re good, because they hit me also when I do something wrong. But they have the most honest morning show. That’s all I can say. It’s the most honest. But the tone, Jim. If you look  —   the hatred. The, I mean, sometimes  —   sometimes somebody gets. .. (CROSSTALK) TRUMP: Well, you look at your show that goes on at 10 o’clock in the evening. You just take a look at that show. That is a constant hit. The panel is almost always exclusive  . The good news is he doesn’t have good ratings. But the panel is almost exclusive  . And the hatred and venom coming from his mouth the hatred coming from other people on your network. Now, I will say this. I watch it. I see it. I’m amazed by it. And I just think you’d be a lot better off, I honestly do. The public gets it, you know. Look, when I go to rallies, they turn around, they start screaming at CNN. They want to throw their placards at CNN. You know. I  —   I think you would do much better by being different. But you just take a look. Take a look at some of your shows in the morning and the evening. If a guest comes out and says something positive about me, it’s  —   it’s brutal. Now, they’ll take this news conference  —   I’m actually having a very good time, OK? But they’ll take this news conference  —   don’t forget, that’s the way I won. Remember, I used to give you a news conference every time I made a speech, which was like every day. OK? (CROSSTALK) TRUMP: No, that’s how I won. I won with news conferences and probably speeches. I certainly didn’t win by people listening to you people. That’s for sure. But I’m having a good time. Tomorrow, they will say, “Donald Trump rants and raves at the press. ” I’m not ranting and raving. I’m just telling you. You know, you’re dishonest people. But  —   but I’m not ranting and raving. I love this. I’m having a good time doing it. But tomorrow, the headlines are going to be, “Donald Trump rants and raves. ” I’m not ranting and raving. Go ahead. QUESTION: If I may, just one more followup. .. TRUMP: Should I let him have a little bit more? What do you think, Peter? Peter, should I have  —   let him have a little bit more? Sit down. Sit down. We’ll. .. (CROSSTALK) QUESTION: Just because of the attack of fake news and attacking our network, I just want to ask you, sir. .. TRUMP: I’m changing it from fake news, though. QUESTION: Doesn’t that under. .. TRUMP: Very fake news. QUESTION: . .. I know, but aren’t you. .. (LAUGHTER) TRUMP: Go ahead. QUESTION: Real news, Mr. President, real news. TRUMP: And you’re not related to our new. .. QUESTION: I am not related, sir. No. I do like the sound of Secretary Acosta, I must say. TRUMP: I looked  —   you know, I looked at that name. I said, wait a minute, is there any relation there? Alex Acosta. QUESTION: I’m sure you checked that out, sir. TRUMP: OK. Now I checked it  —   I said  —   they said, “No, sir. ” I said, “Do me a favor, go back and check the family tree. ” QUESTION: But aren’t you  —   aren’t you concerned, sir, that you are undermining the people’s faith in the First Amendment, freedom of the press, the press in this country, when you call stories you don’t like “fake news”? Why not just say it’s a story I don’t like. TRUMP: I do that. QUESTION: When you call it “fake news,” you’re undermining confidence in our news media (inaudible) important. TRUMP: No, no. I do that. Here’s the thing. OK. I understand what you’re  —   and you’re right about that, except this. See, I know when I should get good and when I should get bad. And sometimes I’ll say, “Wow, that’s going to be a great story. ” And I’ll get killed. I know what’s good and bad. I’d be a pretty good reporter, not as good as you. But I know what’s good. I know what’s bad. And when they change it and make it really bad, something that should be positive  —   sometimes something that should be very positive, they’ll make OK. They’ll even make it negative. So I understand it. So, because I’m there. I know what was said. I know who’s saying it. I’m there. So it’s very important to me. Look, I want to see an honest press. When I started off today by saying that it’s so important to the public to get an honest press. The press  —   the public doesn’t believe you people anymore. Now, maybe I had something to do with that. I don’t know. But they don’t believe you. If you were straight and really told it like it is, as Howard Cosell used to say, right? Of course, he had some questions also. But if you were straight, I would be your biggest booster. I would be your biggest fan in the world, including bad stories about me. But if you go  —   as an example, you’re CNN, I mean it’s story after story after story is bad. I won. I won. And the other thing, chaos because zero chaos. We are running  —   this is a   machine and Reince happens to be doing a good job but half of his job is putting out lies by the press (ph). You know, I said to him yesterday this whole Russia scam that you guys are building so that you don’t talk about the real subject which is illegal leaks, but I watched him yesterday working so hard to try and get that story proper. And I’m saying “here’s my chief of staff,” a really good guy, did a phenomenal job at RNC. I mean, he won the election, right? We won the presidency. We got some senators, we got some  —   all over the country, you take a look, he’s done a great job. And I said to myself, you know  —   and I said to somebody that was in the room, I said “you take a look at Reince, he’s working so hard just putting out fires that are fake fires. ” I mean, they’re fake. They’re not true. And isn’t that a shame because he’d rather be working on healthcare, he’d rather be working on tax reform, Jim (ph). I mean that. I would be your biggest fan in the world if you treated me right. I sort of understand there’s a certain bias maybe by Jeff (ph) or somebody, you know  —   you know, whatever reason. But  —   and I understand that. But you’ve got to be at least a little bit fair and that’s why the public sees it. They see it. They see it’s not fair. You take a look at some of your shows and you see the bias and the hatred. And the public is smart, they understand it. Go ahead. QUESTION: (inaudible) . ..for those who believe that there is something to it, is there anything that you have learned over the last few weeks that you might be able to reveal that might ease their concerns that this isn’t fake news? And second. .. TRUMP: . ..I think they don’t believe it. I don’t think the public  —   that’s why the Rasmussen poll just has me through the roof. I don’t think they believe it. Well, I guess one of the reasons I’m here today is to tell you the whole Russian thing, that’s a ruse. That’s a ruse. And by the way, it would be great if we could get along with Russia, just so you understand that. Now tomorrow, you’ll say “Donald Trump wants to get along with Russia, this is terrible. ” It’s not terrible. It’s good. We had Hillary Clinton try and do a reset. We had Hillary Clinton give Russia 20 percent of the uranium in our country. You know what uranium is, right? This thing called nuclear weapons like lots of things are done with uranium including some bad things. Nobody talks about that. I didn’t do anything for Russia. I’ve done nothing for Russia. Hillary Clinton gave them 20 percent of our uranium. Hillary Clinton did a reset, remember? With the stupid plastic button that made us all look like a bunch of jerks. Here, take a look. He looked at her like, what the hell is she doing with that cheap plastic button? Hillary Clinton  —   that was the reset, remember it said reset? Now if I do that, oh, I’m a bad guy. If we could get along with Russia, that’s a positive thing. We have a very talented man, Rex Tillerson, who’s going to be meeting with them shortly and I told him. I said “I know politically it’s probably not good for me. ” The greatest thing I could do is shoot that ship that’s 30 miles off shore right out of the water. Everyone in this country’s going to say “oh, it’s so great. ” That’s not great. That’s not great. I would love to be able to get along with Russia. Now, you’ve had a lot of presidents that haven’t taken that tack. Look where we are now. Look where we are now. So, if I can  —   now, I love to negotiate things, I do it really well, and all that stuff. But  —   but it’s possible I won’t be able to get along with Putin. Maybe it is. But I want to just tell you, the false reporting by the media, by you people, the false, horrible, fake reporting makes it much harder to make a deal with Russia. And probably Putin said “you know. ” He’s sitting behind his desk and he’s saying “you know, I see what’s going on in the United States, I follow it closely. It’s going to be impossible for President Trump to ever get along with Russia because of all the pressure he’s got with this fake story. ” OK? And that’s a shame because if we could get along with Russia  —   and by the way, China and Japan and everyone. If we could get along, it would be a positive thing, not a negative thing. QUESTION: Is tax reform on the line (ph)? QUESTION: Mr. President? Mr. President? Mr. President, since you. .. TRUMP: Tax reform is going to happen fairly quickly. We’re doing Obamacare. We’re in final stages. We should be submitting the initial plan in March, early March, I would say. And we have to, as you know, statutorily and for reasons of budget, we have to go first. It’s not like, frankly, the tax would be easier, in my opinion, but for statutory reasons and for budgetary reasons, we have to submit the healthcare sooner. So we’ll be submitting healthcare sometime in early March,   March. And after that, we’re going to come up, and we’re doing very well on tax reform. Yes? QUESTION: Mr. President, you mentioned Russia. Let’s talk about some serious issues that have come up in the last week that you have had to deal with as president of the United States. TRUMP: OK. QUESTION: You mentioned the vessel  —   the spy vessel off the coast of the United States. TRUMP: Not good. QUESTION: There was a ballistic missile test that many interpret as a violation of an agreement between the two countries and a Russian plane buzzed a U. S. destroyer. TRUMP: Not good. QUESTION: I listened to you during the campaign . .. TRUMP: Excuse me, excuse me. When did it happen? It happened when, if you were Putin right now, you would say, “Hey, we’re back to the old games with the United States there’s no way Trump can ever do a deal with us. ” Because the  —   you have to understand. If I was just brutal on Russia right now, just brutal, people would say, you would say, “Oh, isn’t that wonderful. ” But I know you well enough. Then you would say, “Oh, he was too tough he shouldn’t have done that. ” Look, all of the. .. (CROSSTALK) QUESTION: I’m just trying to find out your orientation to those. .. (CROSSTALK) TRUMP: Wait a minute. Wait, wait. Excuse me just one second. (CROSSTALK) TRUMP: All of those things that you mentioned are very recent, because probably Putin assumes that he’s not going to be able to make a deal with me because it’s politically not popular for me to make a deal. So Hillary Clinton tries a reset. It failed. They all tried. But I’m different than those people. Go ahead. QUESTION: How are you interpreting those moves? And what do you intend to do about them? Have you given Rex Tillerson any advice or counsel on how to deal? TRUMP: I have. I have. And I’m so beautifully represented. I’m so honored that the Senate approved him. He’s going to be fantastic. Yes, I think that I’ve already. .. QUESTION: Is Putin testing you, do you believe, sir? TRUMP: No, I don’t think so. I think Putin probably assumes that he can’t make a deal with me anymore because politically it would be unpopular for a politician to make a deal. I can’t believe I’m saying I’m a politician, but I guess that’s what I am now. Because, look, it would be much easier for me to be tough on Russia, but then we’re not going to make a deal. Now, I don’t know that we’re going to make a deal. I don’t know. We might. We might not. But it would be much easier for me to be so tough  —   the tougher I am on Russia, the better. But you know what? I want to do the right thing for the American people. And to be honest, secondarily, I want to do the right thing for the world. If Russia and the United States actually got together and got along  —   and don’t forget, we’re a very powerful nuclear country and so are they. There’s no upside. We’re a very powerful nuclear country and so are they. I have been briefed. And I can tell you one thing about a briefing that we’re allowed to say because anybody that ever read the most basic book can say it, nuclear holocaust would be like no other. They’re a very powerful nuclear country and so are we. If we have a good relationship with Russia, believe me, that’s a good thing, not a bad thing. QUESTION: So when you say they’re not good, do you mean that they are. .. TRUMP: Who did I say is not good? QUESTION: No, I read off the three things that have recently happened. Each one of them you said they’re not good. (CROSSTALK) TRUMP: No, it’s not good, but they happened. QUESTION: But do they damage the relationship? Do they undermine. .. TRUMP: They all happened recently. No. .. (CROSSTALK) QUESTION: . .. this country’s ability to work with Russia? TRUMP: They all happened recently. And I understand what they’re doing because they’re doing the same thing. Now, again, maybe I’m not going to be able to do a deal with Russia, but at least I will have tried. And if I don’t, does anybody really think that Hillary Clinton would be tougher on Russia than Donald Trump? Does anybody in this room really believe that? OK? But I tell you one thing, she tried to make a deal. She had the reset. She gave all that valuable uranium away. She did other things. You know, they say I’m close to Russia. Hillary Clinton gave away 20 percent of the uranium in the United States. She’s close to Russia. QUESTION: Can we. .. TRUMP: I gave  —   you know what I gave to Russia? You know what I gave? Nothing. QUESTION: Can we conclude there will be no response to these particular provocations? TRUMP: I’m not going to tell you anything about what response I do. I don’t talk about military response. I don’t say I’m going into Mosul in four months. “We are going to attack Mosul in four months. ” Then three months later, “We are going to attack Mosul in one month. ” “Next week, we are going to attack Mosul. ” In the meantime, Mosul is very, very difficult. Do you know why? Because I don’t talk about military, and I don’t talk about certain other things, you’re going to be surprised to hear that. And by the way, my whole campaign, I’d say that. So I don’t have to tell you. I don’t want to be one of these guys that say, “Yes, here’s what we’re going to do. ” I don’t have to do that. I don’t have to tell you what I’m going to do in North Korea. (CROSSTALK) TRUMP: Wait a minute. I don’t have to tell you what I’m going to do in North Korea. And I don’t have to tell you what I’m going to do with Iran. You know why? Because they shouldn’t know. And eventually, you guys are going to get tired of asking that question. TRUMP: So when you ask me what am I going to do with a ship, the Russian ship as an example, I’m not going to tell you. But hopefully, I won’t have to do anything, but I’m not going to tell you. OK. QUESTION: Could I just ask you  —   thank you very much, Mr. President. The trouble. .. TRUMP: Where are you from? QUESTION: BBC. TRUMP: Here’s another beauty. QUESTION: That’s a good line. Impartial, free and fair. TRUMP: Yeah. Sure. QUESTION: Mr. President. .. TRUMP: Just like CNN right? QUESTION: On the travel ban  —   we could banter back and forth. On the travel ban would you accept that that was a good example of the smooth running of government. .. TRUMP: Yeah, I do. I do. Let me tell you about this government. .. QUESTION: Were there any mistakes. .. TRUMP: Wait. Wait. I know who you are. Just wait. Let me tell you about the travel ban. We had a very smooth rollout of the travel ban. But we had a bad court. Got a bad decision. We had a court that’s been overturned. Again, may be wrong. But I think it’s 80 percent of the time, a lot. We had a bad decision. We’re going to keep going with that decision. We’re going to put in a new executive order next week some time. But we had a bad decision. That’s the other thing that was wrong with the travel ban. You had Delta with a massive problem with their computer system at the airports. You had some people that were put out there, brought by very nice busses, and they were put out at various locations. Despite that the only problem that we had is we had a bad court. We had a court that gave us what I consider to be, with great respect, a very bad decision. Very bad for the safety and security of our country. The rollout was perfect. Now, what I wanted to do was do the exact same executive order, but said one thing. I said this to my people. Give them a   period of time. But Gen. Kelly, now Sec. Kelly, said if you do that, all these people will come in and (inaudible) the bad ones. You do agree there are bad people out there, right? That not everybody that’s like you. You have some bad people out there. Kelly said you can’t do that. And he was right. As soon as he said it I said wow, never thought of it. I said how about one week? He said no good. You got to do it immediately because if you do it immediately they don’t have time to come in. Now nobody ever reports that. But that’s why we did it quickly. Now, if I would’ve done it a month, everything would’ve been perfect. The problem is we would’ve wasted a lot of time, and maybe a lot of lives because a lot of bad people would’ve come into our country. Now in the meantime, we’re vetting very, very strongly. Very, very strongly. But we need help. And we need help by getting that executive order passed. QUESTION: Just a brief  . But if it’s so urgent, why not introduce. .. TRUMP: Yes? Go ahead. QUESTION: Thank you. I was just hoping that we could get a yes or no answer on one of these questions involving Russia. Can you say whether you are aware that anyone who advised your campaign had contacts with Russia during the course of the election? TRUMP: Well I told you, Gen. Flynn obviously was dealing. So that’s one person. But he was dealing, as he should have been. QUESTION: During the election? TRUMP: No. Nobody that I know of. Nobody. .. QUESTION: So you’re not aware of any contact during the course.. TRUMP: Look, look, look. .. QUESTION: . .. of the election? TRUMP: How many times do I have to answer this question? QUESTION: Can you just say yes or no? TRUMP: Russia is a ruse. I know you have to get up and ask a question. It’s so important. Russia is a ruse. I have nothing to do with Russia. Haven’t made a phone call to Russia in years. Don’t speak to people from Russia. Not that I wouldn’t. I just have nobody to speak to. I spoke to Putin twice. He called me on the election. I told you this. And he called me on the inauguration, a few days ago. We had a very good talk, especially the second one, lasted for a pretty long period of time. I’m sure you probably get it because it was classified. So I’m sure everybody in this room perhaps has it. But we had a very, very good talk. I have nothing to do with Russia. To the best of my knowledge no person that I deal with does. Now, Manafort has totally denied it. He denied it. Now people knew that he was a consultant over in that part of the world for a while, but not for Russia. I think he represented Ukraine or people having to do with Ukraine, or people that  —   whoever. But people knew that. Everybody knew that. QUESTION: But in his capacity as your campaign manager, was he in touch with Russian officials during the election? TRUMP: You know what? He said no. I could only tell you what he  —   now he was replaced long before the election. You know that, right? He was replaced long before the election. When all of this stuff started coming out, it came out during the election. But Paul Manafort, who’s a good man also by the way, Paul Manfort was replaced long before the election took place. He was only there for a short period of time. QUESTION: Mr. President. .. TRUMP: How much longer should we stay here, folks? QUESTION: Mr. President. .. TRUMP: Five more minutes. Is that OK? Five? QUESTION: Mr. President, on national. .. TRUMP: Wait. Let’s see. Who’s  —   I want to find a friendly reporter. QUESTION: Mr. ... TRUMP: Are you a friendly reporter? Watch how friendly he is. Wait. Wait. Watch how friendly he is. Go ahead. QUESTION: ( ). .. TRUMP: Go ahead. QUESTION: So first of all, my name is (Inaudible) from (Inaudible) Magazine. I (inaudible). I haven’t seen anybody in my community, including yourself or any of the  —   anyone on your staff of being ( ). Because ( ). However, what we’ve already heard about and what we ( ) is ( ) so you’re general forecast (ph) like 48 ( ). There are people who are everything (ph) happens through their packs (ph) is one of the ( ). .. (CROSSTALK) TRUMP:. ..he said he was gonna ask a very simple, easy question. And it’s not, its not, not  —   not a simple question, not a fair question. OK sit down, I understand the rest of your question. So here’s the story, folks. Number one, I am the least   Semitic person that you’ve ever seen in your entire life. Number two, racism, the least racist person. In fact, we did very well relative to other people running as a Republican  —   quiet, quiet, quiet. See, he lied about  —   he was gonna get up and ask a very straight, simple question, so you know, welcome to the world of the media. But let me just tell you something, that I hate the charge, I find it repulsive. I hate even the question because people that know me and you heard the prime minister, you heard Ben Netanyahu (ph) yesterday, did you hear him, Bibi? He said, I’ve known Donald Trump for a long time and then he said, forget it. So you should take that instead of having to get up and ask a very insulting question like that. (CROSSTALK) TRUMP: Yeah, go ahead. Go ahead. QUESTION: Thank you, I’m Lisa (ph) from the. .. (CROSSTALK) TRUMP: See, it just shows you about the press, but that’s the way the press is. QUESTION: Thank you, Mr. President. Lisa Dejardown (ph) from the PBS News Hour. On national security and immigration, can you give us more details on the executive order you plan for next week? Even its broad outlines? TRUMP: Yeah. QUESTION: Will it be focused on specific. .. TRUMP: It’s a very fair question. QUESTION: . ..countries? And in addition, on the DACA program for immigration. TRUMP: Right. QUESTION: What is your plan, do you plan to continue that program or to end it? TRUMP: We’re gonna show great heart, DACA is a very, very difficult subject for me, I will tell you. To me, it’s one of the most difficult subjects I have because you have these incredible kids. In many cases, not in all cases. And some of the cases, having DACA and they’re gang members and they’re drug dealers, too. But you have some absolutely, incredible kids, I would say mostly. They were brought here in such a way  —   it’s a very  —   it’s a very, very tough subject. We’re gonna deal with DACA with heart. I have to deal with a lot of politicians, don’t forget and I have to convince them that what I’m saying is  —   is right. And I appreciate your understanding on that. But the DACA situation is a very, very  —   it’s a very difficult thing for me because you know, I love these kids, I love kids, I have kids and grandkids. And I find it very, very hard doing what the law says exactly to do and you know, the law is rough. I’m not talking about new laws, I’m talking the existing law, is very rough, it’s very, very rough. As far as the new order, the new order is going to be very much tailored to the what I consider to be a very bad decision. But we can tailor the order to that decision and get just about everything, in some ways, more. But we’re tailoring it now to the decision, we have some of the best lawyers in the country working on it. And the new executive order, is being tailored to the decision we got down from the court. OK? QUESTION: Mr. President. .. (CROSSTALK) QUESTION: . ..reopening of the White House Visitors Office? TRUMP: Yes. QUESTION: And she does a lot of great work for the country as well (ph). Can you talk a little bit about what’s first for (ph) Melania Trump does for the country and (inaudible) so opening White House Visitors Office, what does that mean. .. TRUMP: Now, that’s what I call a nice question. That is very  —   who are you with? QUESTION: ( ) TRUMP: Good, I’m gonna start watching, all right? Thank you very much. Melania’s terrific, she was here last night, we had dinner with Senator Rubio and his wife who is by the way, lovely. And we had a really good discussion about Cuba because we have very similar views on Cuba. And Cuba was very good to me in the Florida election, as you know the Cuban Americans. And I think that Melania’s gonna be outstanding, that’s right, she just opened up the visitors center, in other words, touring of the White House. She, like others that she’s working with, feel very, very strongly about women’s issue, women’s difficulties. Very, very strongly, she’s a very, very strong advocate. I think she’s a great representative for this country. And a funny thing happens, because she gets  —   she gets so unfairly  —   Melania, the things they say. I’ve known her for a long time, she was a very successful person, she was a very successful model. She did really well. She would go home at night and didn’t even want to go out with people. She was a very private person. She was always the highest quality that you’ll ever find. And the things they say  —   I’ve known her for a long time  —   the things they say are so unfair. And actually, she’s been apologized to, as you know, by various media because they said things that were lies. I’ll just tell you this. I think she’s going to be a fantastic first lady. She’s going to be a tremendous representative of women and of the people. And helping her and working her will be Ivanka, who is a fabulous person and a fabulous, fabulous woman. And they’re not doing this for money. They’re not doing this for pay, they’re doing this because they feel it both of them. And Melania goes back and forth and after Barron finishes school  —   because it’s hard to take a child out of school with a few months left  —   she and Barron will be moving over to the White House. OK, thank you, that’s a very nice question. (CROSSTALK) TRUMP: Go ahead. QUESTION: Mr. Trump? TRUMP: Yes, oh, this is going to be a bad question, but that’s OK. QUESTION: It doesn’t( ph) have( ph) to be a bad question. TRUMP: Good, because I enjoy watching you on television. Go ahead. QUESTION: Well, thank you so much. Mr. President, I need to find out from you, you said something as it relates to inner cities. That was one of your platforms during your campaign. Now you’re  —   TRUMP: Fix the inner cities. QUESTION:  —   president. Fixing the inner cities. TRUMP: Yep. QUESTION: What will be that fix and your urban agenda as well as your HBCU Executive Order that’s coming out this afternoon? See, it wasn’t bad, was it? TRUMP: That was very professional and very good. QUESTION: I’m very professional. TRUMP: We’ll be announcing the order in a little while and I’d rather let the order speak for itself. But it could be something that I think that will be very good for everybody concerned. But we’ll talk to you about that after we do the announcement. As far as the inner cities, as you know, I was very strong on the inner cities during the campaign. I think it’s probably what got me a much higher percentage of the African American vote than a lot of people thought I was going to get. We did, you know, much higher than people thought I was going to get. And I was honored by that, including the Hispanic vote, which was also much higher. And by the way, if I might add, including the women’s vote, which was much higher than people thought I was going to get. So, we are going to be working very hard on the inner cities, having to do with education, having to do with crime. We’re going to try and fix as quickly as possible  —   you know, it takes a long time. It’s taken more a hundred years and more for some of these places to evolve and they evolved, many of them, very badly. But we’re going to be working very hard on health and healthcare, very, very hard on education, and also we’re going to be working in a stringent way, in a very good way, on crime. You go to some of these inner city places and it’s so sad when you look at the crime. You have people  —   and I’ve seen this, and I’ve sort of witnessed it  —   in fact, in two cases I have actually witnessed it. They lock themselves into apartments, petrified to even leave, in the middle of the day. They’re living in hell. We can’t let that happen. So, we’re going to be very, very strong. That’s a great question and  —   and it’s a  —   it’s a very difficult situation because it’s been many, many years. It’s been festering for many, many years. But we have places in this country that we have to fix. We have to help African American people that, for the most part, are stuck there. Hispanic American people. We have Hispanic American people that are in the inner cities and their living in hell. I mean, you look at the numbers in Chicago. There are two Chicagos, as you know. There’s one Chicago that’s incredible, luxurious and all  —   and safe. There’s another Chicago that’s worse than almost any of the places in the Middle East that we talk, and that you talk about, every night on the newscasts. So, we’re going to do a lot of work on the inner cities. I have great people lined up to help with the inner cities. OK? QUESTION: Well, when you say the inner cities, are you going  —   are you going to include the CBC, Mr. President, in your conversations with your  —   your urban agenda, your inner city agenda, as well as  —   TRUMP: Am I going to include who? QUESTION: Are you going to include the Congressional Black Caucus and the Congressional  —   TRUMP: Well, I would. I tell you what, do you want to set up the meeting? QUESTION:  —   Hispanic Caucus  —   TRUMP: Do you want to set up the meeting? QUESTION: No  —   no  —   no. I’m not  —   TRUMP: Are they friends of yours? QUESTION: I’m just a reporter. TRUMP: Well, then( ph) set up the meeting. QUESTION: I know some of them, but I’m sure they’re watching right now. TRUMP: Let’s go set up a meeting. I would love to meet with the Black Caucus. I think it’s great, the Congressional Black Caucus. I think it’s great. I actually thought I had a meeting with Congressman Cummings and he was all excited. And then he said, well, I can’t move, it might be bad for me politically. I can’t have that meeting. I was all set to have the meeting. You know, we called him and called him. And he was all set. I spoke to him on the phone, very nice guy. QUESTION: I hear he wanted that meeting with you as well. TRUMP: He wanted it, but we called, called, called and can’t make a meeting with him. Every day I walk and say I would like to meet with him because I do want to solve the problem. But he probably was told by Schumer or somebody like that, some other lightweight. He was probably told  —   he was probably told “don’t meet with Trump. It’s bad politics. ” And that’s part of the problem in this country. OK, one more. QUESTION: (inaudible) TRUMP: No, no, one question. Two we can’t handle. This room can’t handle two. Go ahead, give me the better of your two. QUESTION: (inaudible) . ..not about your personality or your beliefs, talking about (inaudible) some of it by supporters in your name. What do you. .. TRUMP: . ..And some of it  —   can I be honest with you? And this has to do with racism and horrible things that are put up. Some of it written by our opponents. You do know that. Do you understand that? You don’t think anybody would do a thing like that. Some of the signs you’ll see are not put up by the people that love or like Donald Trump, they’re put up by the other side and you think it’s like playing it straight? No. But you have some of those signs and some of that anger is caused by the other side. They’ll do signs and they’ll do drawings that are inappropriate. It won’t be my people. It will be the people on the other side to anger people like you. OK. (CROSSTALK) TRUMP: Go ahead, go ahead. QUESTION: You’re the president now. What are you going to do about it? TRUMP: Who is that? Where is that? QUESTION: What are you going to do about  —   what are you going to do about (inaudible). TRUMP: Oh, I’m working on it. I’m working on it very  —   no, no, look. Hey, just so you understand, we had a totally divided country for eight years and long before that. In all fairness to President Obama, long before President Obama we have had a very divided  —   I didn’t come along and divide this country. This country was seriously divided before I got here. We’re going to work on it very hard. One of the questions I was asked, I thought it was a very good question was about the inner cities. I mean, that’s part of it. But we’re going to work on education, we’re going to work on  —   you know, we’re going to stop  —   we’re going to try and stop the crime. We have great law enforcement officials, we’re going to try and stop crime. We’re not going to try and stop, we’re going to stop crime. But it’s very important to me  —   but this isn’t Donald Trump that divided a nation. We went eight years with President Obama and we went many years before President Obama. We lived in a divided nation. And I am going to try  —   I will do everything within my power to fix that. I want to thank everybody very much. It’s a great honor to be with you. Thank you. Thank you very much, thanks. END	1
316	Steven Levenson’s passionate and provoking “If I Forget” is a family play, a political play and a   play. That kitchen definitely isn’t kosher, even though the family that gathers around it  —   the three adult children of an ailing father, Lou Fischer  —   are outspoken  . Irritable and animated, the Fischers come vibrantly alive in this young playwright’s funny, bruising, searching voice. The play, a Roundabout Theater Company production that opened on Wednesday night, begins in 2000 in an    neighborhood of Washington. The Camp David summit meeting has failed, ushering in the collapse of the   peace process. The renewed intifada seems removed from the    worries of Lou (Larry Bryggman) his children and their spouses and offspring. But world events have a funny way of inviting themselves into this   Colonial. Rocks thrown a world away encourage deeply personal reflections of what it means to be a Jew in America at the turn of the 21st century. The Fischers are a mostly secular clan, and Mr. Levenson doesn’t deck them with Jewish markers  —   there are no skullcaps and no bagels, no briskets and no bris. These characters don’t kvetch or kvell, at least not in those terms. The younger daughter, Sharon (Maria Dizzia) a teacher, used to take Lou to temple, but her observance has dwindled since she discovered her boyfriend and the cantor entangled on her new duvet. Her great regret: “Now I have to get it ” she tells her brother, Michael (Jeremy Shamos). The older daughter, Holly (Kate Walsh of “Private Practice”) a homemaker and design hobbyist, goes to services only on High Holy Days. Michael, a professor of Jewish studies, doesn’t go at all. If Michael is the least religious character, he is also the one most consumed by questions of Jewish identity. He has just finished writing an incendiary book arguing that the persistence of the Holocaust in the minds of American Jews has hollowed out Jewish life. Michael, who hurls his words like so many Molotov cocktails, insists that the Holocaust has made contemporary Judaism “a religion and a culture of, frankly, death and death worship,” and recommends forgetting it. (This point and others owe a debt to Norman G. Finkelstein’s 2000 book, “The Holocaust Industry. ”) These claims don’t sit well with Lou, a World War II veteran who helped liberate Dachau. In a   conversation with Michael, he describes, simply and feelingly, what he saw there and why he can’t and won’t forget. “For you, history is an abstraction,” he says. “But for us, the ones who survived this century, this long, long century, there are no abstractions anymore. ” This speech, poignantly delivered by Mr. Bryggman, elicited spontaneous applause. But so did the earlier and wholly contradictory tirade loosed by Mr. Shamos. No one in Mr. Levenson’s play gets to make the definitive statement. Not even Mr. Levenson. Like other intellectually rigorous plays about to open  —   J. T. Rogers’s “Oslo,” Paula Vogel’s “Indecent” and Lynn Nottage’s “Sweat”  —   “If I Forget” speaks to both the head and the heart. No condescending sense of    here. The problems of what we should remember and what we should forget, who we should be and how we should love seem to confuse Mr. Levenson, too. (The current renewal of   rhetoric and the threats to Jewish spaces have only made the play’s quandaries ring louder.) When it comes to big questions, and smaller ones, too, every character makes reasonable arguments  —   even flaky Holly, even   Sharon  —   and also unreasonable ones. Sorting through that welter of competing claims is a real hassle. And a great gift. But focusing too intently on the play’s stimulating politics risks scanting its humor and its family dynamics. Mr. Levenson has a longtime interest in strained relations between parents and children  —   you can find it in his debut play, “The Language of Trees,” and in his book for the hit Broadway musical “Dear Evan Hansen. ” Yet he has never created a clan as quick to wound and quick to reconcile as the Fischers. “If I Forget” isn’t perfect. The plot, which turns on a question of real estate, takes its time arriving and mostly hangs around to facilitate debate. (And in these debates all the most penetrating arguments go to the men.) That Michael would publish his controversial book just as he’s up for tenure strains credibility, and a later subplot about credit card fraud is even more unlikely. Under Daniel Sullivan’s sensitive direction, the ripe interstitial music nudges emotion too obviously and the ending, which shifts the play into magical realism, makes its themes too explicit. (Mr. Levenson has never been one to wear his metaphors lightly.) But the script and the remarkable actors make you embrace the Fischers  —   however quarrelsome and distractible and fumbling they may be. Watch Michael (in Mr. Shamos’s astonishing performance) and Holly (in a tough and comic turn from Ms. Walsh) play siblings who tear each other apart, then make the same wavering gesture to end the quarrel. Watch Michael and his wife (Tasha Lawrence) and Holly and her husband (Gary Wilmes) and son (Seth Steinberg) reveal layers of injury and devotion. Watch them all stand in the   and warble “Happy Birthday”  —   a family unable to agree on pretty much anything, yet still somehow in unison.	1

18	LOS ANGELES  —   Because he was told that   were box office poison, and he wrote the screenplay for “Hell or High Water” anyway, resulting in one of the few Hollywood films of 2016 to shine a light on   America. Because, as a former actor, he creates vivid characters that are fun to perform. Because he was overlooked by Oscar voters for his last script, the   drug thriller “Sicario. ” Could voting members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences talk themselves into giving Taylor Sheridan the trophy for best original screenplay? With a week and a half to go before ballots are due, the annual Oscar race has officially entered the stage when voters can grow bored with the sure bets  —   repeated for months by prognostication outfits like GoldDerby. com  —   and look for smaller ways to reward films that have little chance of winning bigger prizes. Fitting that bill this time may be Mr. Sheridan, a nominee for “Hell or High Water. ” The   Mr. Sheridan, 47, who quit his journeyman acting career in 2011 and moved to Wyoming, is not the   in his category. Better positioned are the establishment favorite Kenneth Lonergan, who wrote “Manchester by the Sea” and has been nominated by the academy for his writing twice before and Damien Chazelle, the prodigy behind “La La Land” who took home the writing prize at the Golden Globes. [See where to stream “Hell or High Water.] But Mr. Lonergan and Mr. Chazelle are vulnerable. Some voters find Mr. Lonergan’s script overlong. “Manchester by the Sea” is also likely to be honored in other categories, including best actor, where Casey Affleck is a favorite. As for Mr. Chazelle, his screenplay has been overshadowed by his “La La Land” directing (collecting the top prize at the bellwether Directors Guild of America Awards) and the strong likelihood that “La La Land” will win best picture. “Hell or High Water,” a meditation on failure disguised as a    chase movie, has its own disadvantages. It was released by CBS Films and Lionsgate in August, outside the traditional awards corridor. Some dislike its ambiguous ending. And it took in only $27 million at the box office  —   a feat for an art film that cost a lean $12 million to make, but a niche sum all the same. (The final two films vying for the original screenplay Oscar have taken in even less. “The Lobster,” a dystopian story dreamed up by Yorgos Lanthimos and Efthymis Filippou, collected $9. 1 million. Written by Mike Mills, “20th Century Women” has managed $5 million.) But Mr. Sheridan has a shot, partly because giving him a little gold man is a way for voters to sneak some love to the film. Directed by David Mackenzie and starring Jeff Bridges as a twangy Texas marshal, “Hell or High Water” is nominated for best picture but won’t win. Sure, Mr. Bridges could triumph in the supporting actor contest. But Mahershala Ali seems to have that one in the bag for his tender portrayal of a drug dealer in “Moonlight”  —   especially after that emotional speech he gave at the Screen Actors Guild Awards. That leaves Mr. Sheridan. On Monday at the annual Oscar nominee luncheon in Beverly Hills, Mr. Sheridan said that he was still struggling to comprehend his nomination. A win? “You feel so presumptuous to even think about it,” he said quietly. He was wearing a dark suit, but he would probably have been more comfortable in a pair of   cowboy boots. Rather than flying to Los Angeles, he drove from Wyoming  —   a   trip  —   in his   “dually” truck. (For you city slickers, that means it has a set of double tires in the back.) “Hell or High Water” is the story of brothers  —   one younger (Chris Pine) with “a kind face marked by years of sun and disappointment,” as Mr. Sheridan described the character in his script, and one older (Ben Foster) with “an air of danger that attracts as many women as it repels. ” They rob West Texas banks in the throes of the Great Recession to pay back predatory bank loans and save the family homestead. A casually racist lawman (Mr. Bridges) and his part Comanche, part Hispanic deputy (Gil Birmingham) investigate, passing through one dying town after another and meeting various characters, including one of the orneriest waitresses ever put on film. (“That weren’t a question,” she snaps, taking their   steak lunch order.) Mr. Sheridan wrote “Hell or High Water” in less than three weeks. “I don’t outline,” he said. “I sit down to write and I take the ride. If something starts to not feel right, I go back to the last place that felt like jazz to me. ” He wrote what he knew. Mr. Sheridan grew up on a ranch near Cranfills Gap, Tex. population 277. It was a spare existence: His family had no stereo, he said, but they did have Bess, a yellow station wagon with an   player. His parents sometimes sat in the car with a   of beer and listened to Waylon Jennings. The Sheridans lost their property in the   economic downturn. “Otherwise I would still be living there,” Mr. Sheridan said. Instead, he wound up in Austin after flunking out of Texas State University. One day he was approached by a Hollywood talent scout who offered to fly him to Los Angeles. “I figured I might as well take the free trip,” he recalled. To his surprise, Mr. Sheridan began booking small roles on series like “Walker, Texas Ranger. ” By 2011 he had landed a regular part on “Sons of Anarchy,” but he was still struggling to support his family. Conceding that his acting career had peaked, he sat down in his cramped Hollywood apartment and started writing “Sicario,” a dark, morally ambiguous   drama with shifting protagonists. “I had read enough scripts to know what not to do,” he said. “Sicario” rode strong reviews to $85 million in worldwide ticket sales. (A sequel, “Soldado,” may arrive later this year, as may “Wind River,” a thriller about a manhunt on an Indian reservation that Mr. Sheridan wrote and directed.) “Hell or High Water,” Mr. Sheridan’s second script, was equally daring. “A film about rural disenfranchisement and the way that institutions have abandoned people, with a major character in his 60s who spits out racist barbs  —   I never thought it would sell, so I just did exactly what I wanted to do,” Mr. Sheridan said. The film’s racial banter was particularly concerning to the film’s eventual backers. “There was hesitation about that and rightly so,” he said. “But it’s something that exists. That’s how a lot of these guys talk. ” Mr. Sheridan continued: “I think that kind of casual racism comes from insecurity  —   guys who don’t know how to express their affection with each other so they revert to these insults. They think it’s playful. But their words create a divide. ” He paused for a moment, before channeling his inner ornery waitress. “I didn’t want to   these people,” he said gruffly. “I wanted to be really honest  —   take ’em or leave ’em  —   and I think that’s one reason the film has connected. ”	1
926	 There appears to be a couple of elderly, or middle-aged homosexuals who live in Huntington Beach, which is just down the coast from Los Angeles, who every year give a party, a big party, 500 people or so. And they invite everyone they know. It’s an engraved invitation, and to make it amusing they will say, “You’re cordially invited to the coronation of Queen Elizabeth in Huntington Beach.” One year the invitation was, “You are cordially invited to the wedding reception of Rock Hudson and Jim Nabors.” And it went all over the country.Go all over the country it did. A fan magazine picked up on the invites and ran an item which named no names but alluded to the wedding of two same-sex stars. Other gossipmongers spread the word, including a Chicago disk jockey who described the participants as “sort of the rock of Hollywood” and “a plain guy … just neighbors.” That the joke should have explained itself escaped notice: very few picked up on the idea that hunky Mr. Hudson would hereinafter be known as “Rock Pyle,” once again proving the adage no joke is so obvious that some won’t get it. [More] recently, [Nabors] and Rock Hudson have been the victims of a vicious, unfounded and unwarranted story linking them with a non-existent homosexual marriage.“What can I say?” he began. “It’s like a nightmare, a bad dream.”“It’s so ridiculous, yet so horrible, I really don’t know what to say. Of course, it’s untrue. But how do you convince people of something like that? What do you do about a story as horrible as that?”The story of Nabors’ supposed affiliation with Hudson began several months ago when a fan magazine carried an article which, without mentioning any names, led readers to believe it was written about Nabors and Hudson.Nabors confided that his first reaction to the story was to sue for libel and slander, a tactic currently being pursued by Rock Hudson who has reportedly hired a battery of lawyers to gather evidence (or lack of evidence) for a future legal battle.“But,” he said, “[my manager] talked me out of it.”“That’s right,” his manager added. “What would we gain?” All it would accomplish would be to draw attention to it. You sue a fan magazine and you get nowhere. Nobody cares and they have ten lawsuits in front of you. It would take years to get it into court, and then, by that time, so what?”“I haven’t seen Rock Hudson since two seasons ago when he did my television show.”Nabors shook his head. “As God is my witness, I’ve never done anything to hurt anybody. Why would somebody do something like this to me?”“I love kids,” he continued, “But I’ve been so busy with my career that I really haven’t given marriage much thought.” “I heard it from a woman who heard it through her hairdresser. Then all of a sudden I’m getting a lot of mail about the whole stupid situation. It is absolutely preposterous and ridiculous. It has reached such tremendous proportions, there’s really nothing to say. Despite our denials,” Rock said, “some people are going to believe whatever they want to believe. They’ll say ‘B.S.’ or ‘Ah-ha.’“I heard from time to time that ‘it’ happened in Las Vegas, in London, even right in my own home. The truth is it didn’t happen anywhere!”	0

500	A little more than a month into Donald J. Trump’s presidency, it’s safe to say that the satire business in America is booming. Penguin Press announced today that Kurt Andersen and Alec Baldwin will team up to write “You Can’t Spell America Without Me: The Really Tremendous Inside Story of My Fantastic First Year as President Donald J. Trump. ” The book is scheduled for publication in November. Mr. Baldwin (as President Trump) will read the audiobook version. Mr. Andersen is a novelist and the host of the public radio program “Studio 360,” but perhaps most relevant for this new project is his experience as a founding editor of the satirical Spy magazine in the 1980s. It was Spy that now famously referred to the future president as a “  vulgarian. ” The real estate mogul was often in the magazine’s cross hairs. “I didn’t think this former hobby of mine would return with this ferocity,” Mr. Andersen said in a phone interview. Mr. Baldwin’s blustering portrayal of Mr. Trump on “Saturday Night Live,” starting last fall, impresses Mr. Andersen, who said: “It is extreme, and with a guy like Donald Trump, to be effective it needs to be extreme. ” Mr. Andersen suggested the book would be an attempt to capture more of President Trump than just Mr. Baldwin’s version of him. “I think we’ll be channeling and amplifying the real Trump,” Mr. Andersen said. “Writing for a   or   sketch is different than writing a book, which has to be a narrative. ” “I think it’s fair to say that Kurt will do most of the writing,” Mr. Baldwin said in an email interview. “We have that arrangement whereby he doesn’t put on the wig, I don’t open up a Word document. ” Asked how the book would balance broad lampooning with cutting political commentary, Mr. Andersen said: “It’ll be sharp. I’m going to start talking like Trump: It’ll be great! It’ll be fantastic! But it will be sharp. It won’t just be  . ” Two Booker Prize winners have also been influenced by the 45th president’s election. Howard Jacobson’s novella “Pussy,” to be published in Britain in April, is a fairy tale about an egoist from a golden city who falls into a leadership position. In January, Mr. Jacobson told The Guardian that he wrote the book in a “fury of disbelief,” and that he hoped it would offer readers the “consolation of savage satire. ” And Salman Rushdie’s “The Golden House,” to be published in September, reportedly includes a character resembling Mr. Trump. Parodists have been going at the president since the campaign trail. Andrew Shaffer’s “The Day of the Donald,” published last summer, envisioned the first two years under a Trump administration. (From that book’s flap copy: “While Trump’s detractors may call him a tyrant, the American people love bullies when the victim is Congress: Every time they impeach the president, his approval rating skyrockets. ”) In 2016, the comedian and author Michael Ian Black and the illustrator Marc Rosenthal published “A Child’s First Book of Trump,” a picture book with shades of Dr. Seuss that attempted to explain Mr. Trump, a candidate at the time. “There will be a moment when this will be over,” Mr. Baldwin said. “When Trump will fade into ignominy and take with him his ability to outstrip satire. ” Of course, a republic cannot live on satire alone, and several books are in the works that take a more straightforward look at Trump’s election and presidency. Publishers are betting that the new administration will be a boon for sales, much like the Clinton and Obama years drove conservative titles up the   lists. Agents, editors and publishers have been snapping up everything from campaign trail memoirs to   books with images from the women’s march to titles that sound suspiciously like   books (Gene Stone’s “The Trump Survival Guide: Everything You Need to Know About Living Through What You Hoped Would Never Happen”). Allan J. Lichtman, a history professor at American University in Washington has already written “The Case for Impeachment,” which will be published in April. Reporters who were on the Trump beat in 2016 will also offer inside looks at the campaign. In “My Year Covering Trump,” the Washington Post reporter David Fahrenthold will detail his eventful time writing about the candidate. Mr. Fahrenthold conducted a very public investigation of Mr. Trump’s charitable giving, enlisting the help of people on Twitter to find out whether donations had been made. He also exposed the video in which Mr. Trump made vulgar comments about women off camera with the “Access Hollywood” host Billy Bush. The NBC News reporter Katy Tur has sold the rights to a memoir called “Unbelievable. ” Mr. Trump referred to Ms. Tur several times in front of crowds, singling her out for criticism while he discussed the media’s treatment of him. If history is any guide, Mr. Trump will get to have his own say about his presidency in a book someday. For now, the previous president is one step closer to that reality  —   earlier this week, Penguin Random House won a highly competitive auction to publish future books by both Barack and Michelle Obama.	1
25	(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the  .) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. President Trump pledged to work closely with Japan on security and economic issues during a meeting with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe at the White House. The president reaffirmed his support for a defense treaty with Japan that he had questioned during the campaign. The two plan to play golf together in Florida on Saturday. Their closeness is in stark contrast to the president’s relationship with his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, who had been angered by Mr. Trump’s promise to review the status of Taiwan. Mr. Trump backed down from that position in a phone call with Mr. Xi on Thursday night, handing China a diplomatic victory. “Trump lost his first fight with Xi,” one analyst said. _____  2. Among the issues Mr. Abe and Mr. Trump might discuss on the golf course: immigration. Japan has achieved what Mr. Trump promised to: It has very little illegal immigration and is officially closed to people seeking   work. But its tough stance on immigration  —   both legal and illegal  —   is contributing to a severe labor shortage that’s hurting economic growth in the country. Some businesses get around the rules by hiring workers from China and elsewhere as “trainees. ” Critics say the system is rife with exploitation and even abuse. Above, the office of a labor union that houses workers who quit or are laid off. _____ 3. Shortly after Thursday’s appeals court decision blocking his travel ban, Mr. Trump vowed to fight on. “SEE YOU IN COURT,” he wrote on Twitter. Many legal experts say Mr. Trump’s chances of success at the Supreme Court, which for a year now has had just eight members, are slim. A    tie would leave the appeals court ruling in place. The White House is insisting that Judge Neil Gorsuch, the nominee for the Supreme Court, was not referring to Mr. Trump when he said privately that he was disheartened by attacks on the courts. _____ 4. Those trying to divine the roots of the presidential adviser Stephen Bannon’s worldview have combed over a speech that he made in 2014 to a Vatican conference. Little noticed, until now, was a reference to Julius Evola, a deeply taboo,   thinker who was a darling of Italian Fascists. Mr. Evola was a leading proponent of Traditionalism, a set of beliefs embraced by today’s   that argues progress and equality are poisonous illusions. _____ 5. Months after the recapture of Falluja showed that Iraq could regain one of the Islamic State’s strongholds, the victory now seems at risk. There is no sign yet that the   national government can secure and rebuild the Sunni city, and Iraqi and American security officials fear that neglected residents may once again embrace the Islamic State. The scene is more encouraging in parts of Mosul that have been retaken by Iraqi forces, our reporter observed this week. _____ 6. A French farmer who became something of a folk hero for helping migrants was given a fine, but no jail time. Cédric Herrou’s case made headlines around the world. He’ll be off the hook if he “stays out of trouble” for five years, but he vowed to continue offering migrants shelter. “There’s a deficiency of the state in France and in Italy, so I take action,” he said. _____  7. Two celestial events will take place on Friday night: a lunar eclipse and the passing of a comet. The moon will appear slightly darker than usual at about 7:45 p. m. Eastern Standard Time. The comet will be tough to see without binoculars or a telescope. It should appear as a green dot because of its chemical components. If you want to try, the best time would be around 3 a. m. Eastern Time. _____ 8. We’ve rounded up some of the best new children’s books on   history. Here are five illustrated biographies of iconic figures, including “Frederick Douglass: The Lion Who Wrote History. ” The book conveys the centrality of reading and “careful decisions” to Douglass’s struggle for freedom and his later public work, offering an anchor for children trying to comprehend the cruelties of American slavery. _____ 9. The Grammys are Sunday, and the big matchup is Adele versus Beyoncé. The two megaselling queens of pop will face off in each of the top three categories  —   album, record and song of the year. A sweep by Adele could feed into   complaints that the awards too often fail to recognize black performers in the most prestigious categories. Above, setting up for the event. _____ 10. Finally, this weekend is also when many people will celebrate Valentine’s Day. If you express your affection in food, we have recipes at the ready, including mocha chocolate chip cake, above, and less romantic but still delicious dishes like goulash. _____ Photographs may appear out of order for some readers.

499	MASONVILLE, Iowa  —   Lavern Kelchen stood in the back of a church hall in jeans and a   shirt, tapped his left index finger on his leg and placed the winning bid on a   farm here in eastern Iowa. It marked the seventh auction he had attended in the last five years and, with a bid of $9, 000 an acre, his first win. “I’m just getting a really good start,” said Mr. Kelchen, 51, who farms 2, 400 acres near Edgewood, Iowa. “I plan to go as long as I possibly can. ” For farmers like Mr. Kelchen, whose work is a   lifestyle, retirement seems more like a sentence than a prize. “The first two days I’d probably be all right,” he said. “But after that, I’d be going haywire. ” Mark Francois, 64, a farmer who also bid on the farm, echoed that sentiment. “I can only play so much golf,” he said, seated beside his son. “I don’t look forward to retirement. I look forward to doing fieldwork. ” Even Dean Vaske, 52, the farmer whose late parents’ land was being auctioned off, agreed. “I’m glad retirement is far away,” he said. “I love what I do, so why would I want to quit?” Farmers tend to work longer than most Americans, and recent statistics show they are farming even later in life, driven by work that is their identity, aided by technology that lightens its physical toll, and spurred by solid profits off record yields. According to the Department of Agriculture’s latest census, conducted in 2012, the average age of principal farm operators in the United States is 58, up from 50. 5 in 1982. One third are at least 65, the traditional retirement age, and 12 percent are 75 or older. Ask baby boomer farmers here how they are planning for retirement and the likely answer is: They are not. Fifteen percent of Iowa farmers never intend to retire, according to a 2014 farm poll by Iowa State University Extension and Outreach and the state agriculture department. Another 20 percent said they plan to eventually   continuing to provide some managerial control or labor to their farms. Many do not have a formal retirement fund. The land, they say, is their 401( k). The same fierce independence that drew them to farming characterizes their retirement approach: free of pensions, unions and   experts, just how they like it. “We’re on our own,” Mr. Francois said. “All you have to do is ask for advice, but we don’t. ” Only 49 percent of Iowa farmers have identified a successor to eventually run their farms, according to the 2014 farm poll. Many avoid the topic because they equate retirement with mortality. They are quick to relay stories of farmers who died shortly after retiring  —   presumably, they imply, because of a loss of purpose. Even those who have selected a successor are loath to pick a retirement date and actively prepare for it. It took a tornado for Dean Vaske’s father, Art, to retire and move into town. He had been milking cows twice a day until his early 70s. Then the tornado wiped out another son’s farm buildings, prompting Art to invite that son to move onto his farm. Looking back, Dean Vaske said, the transition was smooth. “We couldn’t have planned it much better,” he said. Farmers here assume retirement will work itself out. “If everyone’s raised right, the next generation will take care of us when we get to the point that we can’t farm ourselves,” said Jim Hogan, 66, a   farmer from Monticello, Iowa, whose father never retired. Mr. Hogan has two sons who farm with him and “no idea” how he will structure his retirement income when he scales back from daily operations. Yet he admits that his father’s lack of succession planning (the farm was ultimately left in the control of Mr. Hogan’s mother when his father died) was not ideal, limiting what Mr. Hogan and his brothers can now do with the land, which is still owned by his mother in a trust controlled by a law firm. David W. Baker, a farm transition specialist from Iowa State Extension and Outreach, said that when he counsels families to help them begin discussing retirement, 90 percent of his meetings bring someone to tears. “There are strong feelings about the farm, about what grandpa and grandma did, about my son or daughter having no interest in my farm,” Mr. Baker said. Amanda Van Steenwyk, who leads a   program for the Iowa Farm Bureau, said the   scenario can be devastating. “From the lack of planning, the farm will get split up  —   or even worse, the family will get split up,” she said. A farmer’s retirement is determined by whether an adult child is involved in the operation. This is the case for 31 percent of Iowa farmers, according to the farm poll, which means they will typically sell or rent the land to their farming child upon retirement. Arriving at an equitable arrangement for the nonfarming children can be a challenge, experts say. Meanwhile, there is pressure on the child operating the family farm, said Matt Hein, 61, a Monticello farmer. “You’re actually working with your father’s retirement plan,” he said. “You to go to bed at night thinking, ‘That’s a retirement plan. ’” For Jack Kintzle, 73, a retired   farmer near Cedar Rapids, Iowa, the fact that his children chose not to farm made him wistful at first, but ultimately simplified his retirement equation. “It helped me make a cleaner break,” he said. Now Mr. Kintzle lives off his 700 acres. Some retired farmers   leasing their land and splitting the crop between owner and operator. Others set up a   lease in which another operator pays a fixed price per acre to work the land and keep all of its income. Last year’s average rate was $235 per acre, according to Iowa State data. But farmers are in no rush, guided by a reversal of conventional wisdom on retirement. While many Americans fear they could work themselves to death, farmers see their livelihood as their lifeline. Success does not allow them to quit earlier, it prods them to keep going. And they don’t envy retirees  —   they feel sorry for them. “It’s sad when people have a countdown to retirement,” Mr. Francois said. “They obviously don’t love their job. My friend who worked at the Postal Service had it right down to the hours till he could quit. Now he spends a lot of time just reading. He doesn’t get outside as much. I don’t think he even looks good. ”	1

432	WASHINGTON  —   Former President George W. Bush implicitly criticized President Trump on Monday, taking issue with his approach to immigration and the news media, and suggested that any ties between the new president’s team and Russia should be investigated. In a television interview to promote a new book of his paintings, Mr. Bush indicated that important questions were raised by reported contacts between Russian officials and Mr. Trump’s associates during last year’s election campaign. Mr. Trump forced out his national security adviser for withholding information about a call with Russia’s ambassador. “I think we all need answers,” Mr. Bush said on the “Today” show on NBC. He said he would defer to Senator Richard M. Burr, Republican of North Carolina and chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, about how such an investigation should be conducted. He is a “really good guy, and an independent thinker,” Mr. Bush said of Mr. Burr, “and if he were to recommend a special prosecutor, then it would have a lot more credibility with me. ” Like other members of his family, Mr. Bush did not support Mr. Trump during last year’s campaign against Hillary Clinton, although in public he largely kept his views to himself. Mr. Bush congratulated Mr. Trump after his victory and attended the inauguration last month, but the interview on Monday made clear that the most recent Republican president still had serious disagreements with his party’s incumbent commander in chief. Although he did not mention Mr. Trump by name, Mr. Bush expressed disapproval of the president’s assertion that “fake news media” organizations are the “enemy of the American people. ” “I consider the media to be indispensable to democracy,” Mr. Bush told Matt Lauer, the “Today” host. “We need the media to hold people like me to account. I mean, power can be very addictive and it can be corrosive and it’s important for the media to call to account people who abuse their power, whether it be here or elsewhere. ” He seemed to suggest that language like Mr. Trump’s made it more difficult to press authoritarian leaders like President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia to tolerate a free press. “It’s kind of hard to, you know, tell others to have an independent free press when we’re not willing to have one ourselves,” he said. Mr. Bush also urged tolerance when asked about Mr. Trump’s efforts to temporarily ban travelers from seven predominantly Muslim countries. As president, Mr. Bush made a point of visiting a mosque after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, and regularly insisted that the United States was not at war with Islam. “It’s very important for all of us to recognize one of our great strengths is for people to worship the way they want to or not worship at all,” Mr. Bush said. “I mean the bedrock of our freedom  —   a bedrock of our freedom is the right to worship freely. ” Asked if he supported a ban on Muslim visitors to the United States, the former president said, “I am for an immigration policy that’s welcoming and upholds the law. ” But Mr. Bush, who has emphasized the importance of not criticizing a successor, tried to avoid seeming too critical of Mr. Trump. “Well, first of all, there’s only been one month in office,” he said. “Secondly, I think you have to take the man for his word that he wants to unify the country, and we’ll see whether he’s able to do so. ” Mr. Bush agreed to give interviews to publicize his book, “Portraits of Courage: A Commander in Chief’s Tribute to America’s Warriors,” published by Crown Publishing. The book, his third since leaving office, is a collection of 66 portraits of military veterans he has gotten to know personally. It also includes a   mural he painted of several active and former members of the military. The paintings will be displayed at his presidential center in Dallas from March to October. Mr. Bush picked up painting after leaving office when the historian John Lewis Gaddis mentioned that it was a hobby of Winston Churchill’s. The former president’s initial efforts focused on his pets as subjects. Then he painted a series of portraits of world leaders he met while in office, including Mr. Putin, and displayed them at his center. Mr. Bush, who as commander in chief ordered American forces into Afghanistan and Iraq, hosts regular bicycle rides and golf tournaments with wounded veterans and decided to make them his next focus. He started painting them in September 2015. Some of the portraits in the book show veterans with prosthetic limbs. A few depict amputees playing golf. “I painted these men and women as a way to honor their service to the country and to show my respect for their sacrifice and courage,” he wrote in the book. “I hope to draw attention to the challenges some face when they come home and transition to civilian life  —   and the need for our country to better address them. ”	1
239	LONDON  —   Swedes reacted with confusion, anger and ridicule on Sunday to a vague remark by President Trump that suggested that something terrible had occurred in their country. During a   rally on Saturday in Florida, Mr. Trump issued a sharp if discursive attack on refugee policies in Europe, ticking off a list of places that have been hit by terrorists. “You look at what’s happening,” he told his supporters. “We’ve got to keep our country safe. You look at what’s happening in Germany, you look at what’s happening last night in Sweden. Sweden, who would believe this?” Not the Swedes. Nothing particularly nefarious happened in Sweden on Friday  —   or Saturday, for that matter  —   and Swedes were left baffled. “Sweden? Terror attack? What has he been smoking? Questions abound,” Carl Bildt, a former prime minister and foreign minister, wrote on Twitter. As the Swedish newspaper Aftonbladet noted, Twitter users were quick to ridicule Mr. Trump’s remark, with joking references to the Swedish Chef, the “Muppets” character Swedish meatballs and Ikea, the furniture giant. Mr. Trump did not state, per se, that a terrorist attack had taken place in Sweden. But the context of his remarks  —   he mentioned Sweden right after he chastised Germany, a destination for refugees and asylum seekers fleeing war and deprivation  —   suggested that he thought it might have. “Sweden,” Mr. Trump said. “They took in large numbers. They’re having problems like they never thought possible. ” He then invoked the terrorist attacks that took place in Paris in 2015 and in Brussels and Nice, France, last year, to make an argument for tightening scrutiny of travelers and asylum seekers. “We’ve allowed thousands and thousands of people into our country, and there was no way to vet those people,” he said. “There was no documentation. There was no nothing. So we’re going to keep our country safe. ” Sarah Huckabee Sanders, a White House spokeswoman, tried to clarify the president’s remarks Sunday, saying Mr. Trump did not mean to suggest that a particular attack had happened the night before, but rather was talking about crime in general in Sweden. On Sunday, Mr. Trump offered his own clarification, writing on Twitter, “My statement as to what’s happening in Sweden was in reference to a story that was broadcast on @FoxNews concerning immigrants  Sweden. ” In that story, the Fox News host Tucker Carlson interviewed Ami Horowitz, a filmmaker who asserts that migrants in Sweden have been associated with a crime wave. “They oftentimes try to cover up some of these crimes,” Mr. Horowitz said, arguing that those who try to tell the truth about the situation are shouted down as racists and xenophobes. (Mr. Carlson interjected, “The masochism of the West knows no bounds at all. ”) Mr. Horowitz said, “Sweden had its first terrorist Islamic attack not that long ago, so they’re now getting a taste of what we’ve been seeing across Europe already. ” It was not clear what he was referring to. In 2010, a suicide bomber struck central Stockholm, injuring two people. The bomber, Taimour Abdulwahab   28, was an   Swede who had developed an affinity for Al Qaeda. But that attack occurred long before the current wave of migrants. Sweden has a long history of welcoming refugees  —   Jews, Iranians, Eritreans, Somalis, Kurds and people from the former Yugoslavia, among others  —   but even some of the most tolerant and idealistic Swedes have raised questions about whether the country can absorb so many newcomers so quickly. Henrik Selin, a political scientist and deputy director of the Swedish Institute, a state agency dedicated to promoting Sweden globally, said he was puzzled by Mr. Trump’s remarks. “I do not have a clue what he was referring to,” he said in a telephone interview. “Obviously, this could be connected to the fact that there has been a lot of negative reporting about Sweden, since Sweden has taken in a lot of refugees. ” The country processed 81, 000 asylum seekers in 2014, 163, 000 in 2015 and 29, 000 last year, with another 25, 000 to 45, 000 expected this year, according to the Swedish Migration Agency. Mr. Selin completed a study recently focusing on negative news reports about Sweden’s acceptance of refugees. It found numerous exaggerations and distortions, including false reports that Shariah law was predominant in parts of the country and that some   neighborhoods were considered “  zones” by the police. Breitbart News, the   website once led by Stephen K. Bannon, now Mr. Trump’s senior strategist, has published numerous stories alleging that migrants have been responsible for a surge in crime and for a wave of sexual assaults. Swedish officials have said that their statistics do not justify such sweeping assertions, and that the country has a high number of sexual assault reports relative to other European countries because more victims come forward, not because there is more violence. Mr. Selin said the news reports “were highly exaggerated and not based in facts,” adding, “Some of the stories were very popular to spread in social media by people who have the same kind of agenda  —   that countries should not receive so many refugees. ” As for the   alleged by Mr. Horowitz, Mr. Selin said: “That kind of claim has been in the political debate for 15 years now. But nobody has been able to prove there is a  . On the contrary, the fact is that crime rates are going down. ” He added: “Swedish authorities have nothing to gain from hiding the truth. We are quite keen to ensure that the debate and the story about our country is   and nuanced. We are more than happy to talk about the challenges our country faces as well as the things that are going well. ” Asked about Mr. Trump’s comment, Anna Kinberg Batra, the leader of the opposition Moderate Party, said in a statement, “President Trump has to answer himself for his statements, why he makes them and based on what facts. ” Foreign Minister Margot Wallstrom declined to comment because, her press secretary, Erik Wirkensjo, said, “it’s hard to say what Trump is talking about. ” In an essay in the newspaper Dagens Nyheter, the journalist Martin Gelin speculated that “Trump might have gotten his news from the countless   media in the United States that have long been reporting that Sweden is heading for total collapse. ” He added, “Among Trump supporters, there are common myths that Sweden is in a state of chaos after taking in refugees from the Middle East. ”	1
321	WASHINGTON  —   Reduced to their weakest state in a generation, Democratic Party leaders will gather in two cities this weekend to plot strategy and select a new national chairman with the daunting task of rebuilding the party’s depleted organization. But senior Democratic officials concede that the blueprint has already been chosen for them  —   by an incensed army of liberals demanding no less than total war against President Trump. Immediately after the November election, Democrats were divided over how to handle Mr. Trump, with one camp favoring   confrontation and another backing a seemingly less risky approach of coaxing him to the center with offers of compromise. Now, spurred by explosive protests and a torrent of angry phone calls and emails from constituents  —   and outraged themselves by Mr. Trump’s swift moves to enact a   agenda  —   Democrats have all but cast aside any notion of conciliation with the White House. Instead, they are mimicking the Republican approach of the last eight years  —   the “party of no”  —   and wagering that brash obstruction will pay similar dividends. Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington, vice chairman of the Democratic Governors Association, said there had been a “tornado of support” for    resistance to Mr. Trump. Mr. Inslee, who backed a lawsuit against the president’s executive order banning refugee admissions and travel from seven   countries, said Democrats intended to send a stern message to Mr. Trump during a conference of governors in the nation’s capital. “My belief is, we have to resist every way and everywhere, every time we can,” when Mr. Trump offends core American values, Mr. Inslee said. By undermining Mr. Trump across the board, he said, Democrats hope to split Republicans away from a president of their own party. “Ultimately, we’d like to have a few Republicans stand up to rein him in,” Mr. Inslee said. “The more air goes out of his balloon, the earlier and likelier that is to happen. ” Yet Democrats acknowledge there is a wide gulf between the party’s desire to fight Mr. Trump and its power to thwart him, quietly worrying that the expectations of the party’s activist base may outpace what Democratic lawmakers can achieve. “They want us to impeach him immediately,” said Representative John Yarmuth, Democrat of Kentucky. “And of course we can’t do that by ourselves. ” Some in the party also fret that a posture of unremitting hostility to the president could imperil lawmakers in red states that Mr. Trump won last year, or compromise efforts for Democrats to present themselves to moderate voters as an inoffensive alternative to the polarizing president. Rarely have Democrats been so weakened. Republicans control the White House, both chambers of Congress and 33 governorships, and they are preparing to install a fifth conservative, Neil M. Gorsuch, on the Supreme Court. Further, because of changes to Senate rules that were enacted under Democratic control, the party has been unable to block Mr. Trump’s cabinet nominees from being confirmed by a simple majority vote. Democrats, in other words, have few instruments at the moment to wound Mr. Trump’s administration in the manner their core voters are demanding. Still, a mood of stiff opposition has taken hold on Capitol Hill, with Democrats besieged by constituents enraged by Mr. Trump’s actions  —   and lawmakers sharing their alarm. “We have to fight like hell to stop him and hopefully save our country,” said Senator Jeff Merkley, Democrat of Oregon, echoing the   stakes liberal voters are giving voice to at crowded town hall meetings. Senator Thomas R. Carper of Delaware, a     Democrat up for   in 2018, cautioned that loathing Mr. Trump, on its own, was not a governing strategy. He said he still hoped for compromise with Republicans on infrastructure funding and perhaps on a plan to improve or “repair” the Affordable Care Act. “There is this vitriol and dislike for our new president,” Mr. Carper said. “The challenge for us is to harness it in a productive way and a constructive way, and I think we will. ” But Mr. Carper said the deliberations over Mr. Trump’s cabinet appointments had woken up Democrats, recalling that he had heard from thousands of voters about Scott Pruitt, Mr. Trump’s Environmental Protection Agency administrator, and Betsy DeVos, his education secretary. Virtually every message expressed seething opposition, he said. At times, Democratic frustration with Mr. Trump has already flared well beyond the normal range of opposition discourse: In Virginia, Tom Perriello, a former congressman seeking his party’s nomination for governor, apologized after calling Mr. Trump’s election a “political and constitutional Sept. 11. ” And in New Jersey, Phil Murphy, a former Goldman Sachs banker and ambassador to Germany, drew criticism in his campaign for governor after likening the current political moment in America to the rise of Adolf Hitler. Among    Democrats, however, it is far from clear that the rhetoric of heated opposition is unwelcome. A survey published on Wednesday by the Pew Research Center found that nearly   of Democrats said they were concerned the party would not do enough to oppose Mr. Trump only 20 percent were concerned Democrats would go too far in opposition. A handful of liberal groups have already sprung up threatening to wage primary challenges against incumbent Democrats whom they see as insufficiently militant against Mr. Trump, raising the prospect of the same internecine wars that plagued Republicans during President Barack Obama’s administration. In the race for the chairmanship of the Democratic National Committee, which concludes with a vote in Atlanta on Saturday, the restive mood of liberal activists has buoyed a pair of insurgents, Representative Keith Ellison of Minnesota and Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind. against the perceived   Thomas E. Perez. Mr. Perez, who was Mr. Obama’s labor secretary, is still viewed as a favorite in the race, and he has been backed by former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. But he has struggled to dispel the impression that he is an anointed favorite of Washington power brokers. And Mr. Ellison and Mr. Buttigieg have continued to collect   endorsements: Mr. Ellison won the support of Representative John Lewis of Georgia, the civil rights leader, on Tuesday, and Mr. Buttigieg was endorsed Wednesday by Howard Dean, the former party chairman who remains admired on the left. In a sign of how little heed Democrats are paying to traditional forces, Mr. Ellison remains viable despite being bluntly attacked as “an  ” by Haim Saban, one of the most prolific donors to the party and its candidates. Christine C. Quinn, a vice chairwoman of the New York State Democratic Committee, who was a prominent surrogate for Hillary Clinton last year, said she backed Mr. Ellison, who was the first Muslim elected to Congress, in part because of the forcefulness of his criticism of the White House. “This is not a normal Republican president, and these are not normal times,” said Ms. Quinn, a former speaker of the New York City Council. “This isn’t a time for polite parties anymore. This is a time to take a different posture of true aggressiveness. ” Martin O’Malley, a former Maryland governor who has endorsed Mr. Buttigieg, said impatient Democrats might challenge even members of their own party in their enthusiasm to take on Mr. Trump. Mr. O’Malley said the party base plainly wanted leaders who would be “willing to fight the fight and where necessary filibuster and otherwise obstruct. ” He said he expected younger,   liberals to run against some Democratic incumbents as well as Republicans. “That’s a good thing, and it’s overdue,” he said. So far, the most prominent leaders of the Democratic Party’s activist wing, including Senators Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont, have not encouraged challenges to sitting Democratic lawmakers who have accommodated Mr. Trump. Mr. Merkley, an ally of Mr. Sanders, suggested liberals seeking scalps would get no help from progressive senators if they try to unseat Democratic senators from conservative Missouri, Montana, North Dakota and West Virginia, calling those lawmakers “perfectly suited to those states. ” Two mayors in Democratic cities, however, have gotten a taste of what awaits those who do not bow completely to the demands of the   forces: When Carolyn Goodman of Las Vegas, a Democrat turned independent, and Levar Stoney of Richmond, Va. a Democrat, resisted deeming their municipalities “sanctuary cities,” each was met with anger from supporters of expanding protection against deportation for undocumented immigrants. “They want change to happen overnight,” Mr. Stoney said of the newly energized activists. Nowhere is it more clear, however, that the protesters are leading the politicians than on Capitol Hill. Senate Democratic leaders had hoped to capitalize on Mr. Trump’s nomination of Tom Price as health secretary by assailing Republicans for wanting to trim Medicare, an issue Democrats aim to run on in 2018. But Mr. Price was vastly overshadowed by the nomination of Ms. DeVos, who galvanized the new activists like no other cabinet pick. “Part of what I think the Bernie campaign taught us, even the Trump campaign taught us, and now the resistance is teaching us, is just ditch the consultants and consult with your conscience and constituents first,” said Senator Brian Schatz of Hawaii, warning his fellow Democrats that “it’s a fool’s errand to try to plan this out like it’s a traditional political operation. ” Mr. Merkley boasted that “we’re doing things in the Senate that are less conventional,” efforts he said were aimed at conveying to   voters that “hey, we’re here and we’re fighting. ” Those efforts have included tactics like walking out on nomination hearings and opposing even less controversial cabinet appointments, such as that of Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao, the wife of the Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell. The fear factor is real, said Adam Jentleson, a former Senate Democratic aide. Images of angry constituents jeering Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, a reliable liberal from Rhode Island, at a town   meeting in late January for supporting the selection of Mike Pompeo as C. I. A. director quickly circulated among other Democratic senators, he said. “It was ” Mr. Jentleson said, “because it made clear that the base is not going to let them off the hook. ”	1
578	 On Thursday, while campaigning in California, former Secretary of State and presumptive Democratic nominee for President weighed in on the debate. After being asked for her thoughts on the situation, Hillary Clinton took the opportunity to frame the question into the larger debate over police violence and racial tension in America.“I will tell you one thing,” Clinton said to a group of reporters. “If that gorilla was white, this situation would have ended differently. This was another senseless act of violence that spawned from prejudicial views about skin color.”“Trayvon Martin, Freddie Gray, Michael Brown — now you can add Harambe to that list,” Clinton continued.The Trump campaign has not yet responded to Clinton’s comments, but a representative from Black Lives Matter applauded what they called Clinton’s “courageous stand against injustice.” Christian Times Newspaper is your premier online source for news, commentary, opinion, and theories.

793	 Secret Service Agent Says Obama Is Muslim & Gay In New Tell-All Book. NBC News. Is this true?

I would say a good portion of the men, over fifty-percent, were Muslim.”	0
465	Ray Dalio, the billionaire founder of Bridgewater Associates, the world’s biggest hedge fund, is stepping down from its    operation as he continues to struggle to find a successor to run the firm, known for its unusual culture of “radical transparency. ” Mr. Dalio, 67, said on Wednesday that he was giving up the title of   executive and handing operational control to two longtime deputies who sit on the management committee of the $150 billion firm. He also announced the sudden departure of another   executive, Jon Rubinstein, a former senior executive at Apple who was once a deputy to Steve Jobs. Mr. Rubinstein, who joined Bridgewater 10 months ago, is the third   executive in recent years to leave the firm after spending less than a year on the job. Referring to Mr. Rubinstein’s departure, Mr. Dalio said they “mutually agree that he is not a cultural fit. ” Craig Mundie, a former   chairman who introduced Mr. Rubinstein to Bridgewater executives, resigned at the end of last year, said two people with direct knowledge of the firm who were not authorized to speak publicly. He and Mr. Rubinstein remain advisers to the firm. Mr. Dalio’s announcement is the latest sign of turmoil at the top of Bridgewater, which manages money for more than 300 pension funds, sovereign wealth funds and other institutional investors. Last year, Greg Jensen, one of Mr. Dalio’s longtime lieutenants, who was viewed as his heir apparent, was suddenly stripped of his role as   executive amid reports of a power struggle. Both men denied there was any rift, and Mr. Jensen remains at the firm as   investment officer. With the latest move, Mr. Dalio will not be going far  —   he will remain chairman and   investment officer  —   and it is not clear how much authority he will be willing to yield. Over the years, the firm has developed a corporate philosophy that resembles a cross between a religion and something of a cult. Mr. Dalio named David McCormick, the firm’s president, as   executive with Eileen Murray, who has been a longtime member of Mr. Dalio’s management committee. Some in the industry were encouraged by the announcement. “We are seeing a peaceful transition of power, usually a positive indicator,” said Putri Pascualy, managing director and credit strategist at Pacific Alternative Asset Management. “Nonetheless,” she added, “the real test is over the next few years, on whether the firm can outlast its founder. ” Bridgewater has had a frenzy of hires, departures and promotions in recent years, and several prominent executives have suddenly left the firm after short tenures. In 2010, Julian Mack, once a top executive at the consulting firm McKinsey, and Tony Murphy, a former top executive in the Americas for HSBC, left after less than six months on Bridgewater’s executive committee, according to an internal document seen by The New York Times. Other prominent hires were removed from the management committee not long after they joined the firm. A due diligence report for Bridgewater investors from the end of 2011 detailed how Joe Parsons, hired away from GE Capital in 2010, left Bridgewater’s management committee a year after joining the firm. Mr. Parsons left the hedge fund altogether in 2014. Something similar happened with James B. Comey, a former United States deputy attorney general, whom Mr. Dalio hired from Lockheed Martin in 2010 as general counsel. Mr. Comey left Bridgewater’s executive committee in 2011 and left the firm in early 2013. He was subsequently nominated by President Obama to become director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Turnover at Bridgewater is not confined to the management ranks. It is estimated that as many   of employees at Bridgewater leave within the first two years because they have difficulty with its unusual culture, which focuses on a book of philosophical underpinnings penned by Mr. Dalio called “Principles. ” Bridgewater, which employs about 1, 500 people, most at its secluded corporate campus in Westport, Conn. is widely known for videotaping all employee meetings and encouraging debates on many topics, even some as mundane as what kind of yogurt to stock in the employee dining area. Mr. Dalio has made no secret that life at his firm is not for everyone. “Some people absolutely hate it, and some people could never work anywhere else,” Mr. Dalio said at a hedge fund conference in Manhattan in September. The firm’s culture was the focus of articles in The Times and The Wall Street Journal last year. Mr. Dalio reacted angrily to the coverage, posting lengthy responses on LinkedIn and calling the articles sensational and misleading. Mr. Dalio was annoyed over the Times’s reporting last year on the firm’s handling of a sexual harassment complaint filed by a male employee against his supervisor. On Wednesday, he said he was posting details of the management   on LinkedIn because “our communications often find their way into the media in distorted ways. ” Most of the firm’s employment contracts contain stringent   noncompete clauses, and employees are required to sign nondisclosure agreements that often limit the ability of former employees to discuss their time at the firm. An email sent to Mr. Rubinstein seeking comment was answered by an email from a Bridgewater spokesman, who said, “Jon asked me to decline on his behalf. ” In his letter on LinkedIn, Mr. Dalio said the moves were part of Bridgewater’s   transition strategy in preparation for the day when he would step down. That strategy involved creating a management committee with multiple members in what it has called a “planful transition from a   boutique to a professionally managed institution. ” He added, “Any organization run by a 60+ year old that says that it isn’t in transition is either naïve or disingenuous. ” Bridgewater operates three main investment funds. Last year, its All Weather Fund II was up 12. 8 percent, its Optimal fund was up 7 percent, and its Pure Alpha II fund was up 2. 4 percent Mr. Dalio is well known for popularizing the kind of investment called risk parity, which seeks to protect clients from losses when stocks or bonds sell off. The strategy relies heavily on investing in bonds using leverage. The firm has written many white papers on the topic and posted them on its website. Mr. McCormick, the firm’s president, who was Treasury undersecretary for international affairs under President George W. Bush, was said to have been considered for several jobs in the Trump administration. He met with President Trump shortly after the election. Ms. Murray had a   with top executives that culminated in an investigation into an incident involving her and another employee and whether she had lied about her conversations with that employee. Interviews conducted in the investigation, which was led by Mr. Comey, were videotaped and widely seen by employees at the firm and came to be known as “Eileen Lies. ”	1
107	Frank Ancona, the professed leader of the Traditionalist American Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, was shot and killed in Missouri last week in what officials called a “tragic and senseless act of violence. ” His wife and stepson were charged in his death on Monday. His body was found on a riverbank on Saturday with gunshot wounds to the head, according to the Washington County coroner, Brian DeClue, who called the death a homicide. In an interview, he said that Mr. Ancona, 51, was killed with “a shotgun of some sort. ” Jerrod Mahurin, the prosecutor in the case, said Mr. Ancona was also shot in the head with a   handgun. On Monday, Mr. Ancona’s wife, Malissa Ancona, 44, and stepson, Paul Jinkerson Jr. 24, were charged with a range of crimes in connection with the killing, including   murder and the abandonment of a corpse, according to the St. Francois County Sheriff’s Department. The sheriff said Mr. Ancona was killed at his home last Thursday, and his body was then left at a remote location. Mr. Mahurin said he believed the killing happened because of a marital dispute and was not connected to Mr. Ancona’s membership in the K. K. K. The Washington County Sheriff’s Office said that it learned of Mr. Ancona’s disappearance on Friday, shortly before his vehicle was discovered on land owned by the United States Forest Service. His body was found on the banks of the Big River in Belgrade, Mo. the next day by a family who had gone to fish. In an interview with The New York Times this month, Mr. Ancona said he had been a member of the Klan for more than 30 years. He formed the Traditionalist American Knights in 2009. There are at least 29 separate, rival Klan groups currently active in the United States, and they compete with one another for members, dues, news media attention and the title of being the true heir to the Ku Klux Klan, said Mark Potok, a researcher at the Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks extremism in the United States. Most recently, Mr. Ancona was accused by rival Klansmen of being secretly Jewish. “It is endless infighting,” Mr. Potok said. Mr. Ancona’s group was not considered the largest or the most influential iteration of the Klan, but he was skilled at attracting the spotlight. During the 2014 protests in Ferguson, Mo. after the police killing of Michael Brown, Mr. Ancona’s group passed out leaflets in the city, vowing to use “lethal force” against protesters. The fliers got him invited on MSNBC. Shortly after, Mr. Ancona explained his beliefs in an interview with a member of the hacker group Anonymous, which later claimed to have gained access to his group’s files and released his personal information. This year, the group also distributed fliers in several towns in Maine, far from its base in Park Hills, Mo. Mr. Ancona pointed to these operations as a sign of his group’s popularity and reach, but Mr. Potok said it had no more than a few dozen members in chapters in three states: Missouri, Idaho and Pennsylvania. Mr. Ancona promoted the Klan as a nonviolent fraternal organization for white Christian men, something akin to a   group that endorsed the separation of the races and opposed what he called “equality propaganda. ” “I don’t focus on the negative history,” Mr. Ancona said, adding that he did not understand why people were afraid of the Klan. “What Klansman do you ever see go out and see terrorize anyone?” But the group’s website and fliers contained a more violent message, including images of hooded Klansmen brandishing nooses, racist cartoons of   and the letters “KKK” engulfed in flames. In one picture, which appeared to be manipulated, Mr. Ancona stood before a burning cross. “They want to portray us as all toothless, redneck tobacco chewers,” Mr. Ancona said this month. “Some of us are! But some of us are college educated. I am a business owner,” he said. “We just believe in promoting traditional American values. ” Mr. Ancona dismissed the Klan’s violent history as the work of “a few bad apples” in another era. He said killings attributed to the group during the civil rights era were the work of government agents, like those who infiltrated civil rights groups at the time. “I’d say that operation cointelpro really never ended,” he said. In reality, the K. K. K. has killed scores of people since it was founded in 1865, the vast majority of them  . Many of the crimes believed to be committed by the Klan were not investigated, so the precise number of its victims may never be known. “Frank Ancona posed as the kinder, gentler Klansman, but he was really none of those things,” Mr. Potok said. “A lot of these characters seem like jokes  —   and some of them really are  —   but that doesn’t mean they’re not incredibly dangerous. ”	1

469	Major League Baseball officials are finally addressing something that many fans have complained about for years: the length of games. The average game last season took three hours. Playoff games are even more trying, now often stretching beyond three and a half hours. So what should be done? We invited our reporters and readers to submit proposals. Here’s a selection (add your ideas in the comments section): Major League Baseball wants more action and less downtime during games. That’s probably asking too much, because hitters are paid to work deep counts while pitchers throw harder, with better movement, than ever before. It’s no accident that the number of strikeouts rises every year. The larger issue, of course, is expanding the business, which means attracting more fans. And baseball won’t touch the biggest impediments to that effort, because it would mean less money now. Want to make the game move more quickly? Cut every commercial break by 30 seconds. Want more people to watch in the postseason? Insist that Fox show the League Championship Series on its regular network, not on the    Fox Sports 1. This is most important: Make the World Series appointment viewing, as it was a generation ago. October will mark the 30th anniversary of the last World Series game held in the afternoon. If you want to appeal to young fans in all areas of the country, let them watch at least one World Series game every year before bedtime. They’ll repay that   gesture when they grow up, if baseball can wait that long for the payoff.  —   TYLER KEPNER Boredom is the whole point of baseball, an antidote to the accelerated hysteria of modern life. But if you want to speed it up, why not make the experience as unpleasant as possible, as they do in English soccer games? Make the fans enter through tiny turnstiles surrounded by armed police officers. Make the seats really uncomfortable and humiliate anyone who leaves in the middle of play to get food or go to the bathroom. Encourage people to shout abuses at one another and to chuck garbage onto the field. No kiss cams. No   stretch. You want to sing “Take Me Out to the Ball Game,” or, worse, “Sweet Caroline”? Do it on your own time. Anyone who attempts to propose to his or her partner via the Jumbotron will be ejected from the game and banned for life. As for the players: No relaxing. No chatting. No being nice to your opponents. No doing that thing where you waste time knocking the dirt out of your shoes with your bat for good luck, or whatever. You’re hit by a   your   from an open wound? Suck it up. Cap the games at five innings. Make sure at least 75 percent of the crowd is in a vile temper by the end of the game. If the score is tied, the winner should be determined by penalty kicks.  —   SARAH LYALL Ban all mound visits except when using one of three allotted timeouts per game. Imagine a basketball player has just entered the action. The buzzer sounds and she walks onto the court. But before play resumes, the coach strolls to midcourt to discuss strategy with her. A preposterous idea, of course, but that happens in baseball every time there is a pitching change, and often when there is not. The relief pitcher was just sitting in the bullpen spitting sunflower seeds for the last two hours with a telephone hookup to the dugout five feet away. Talk to him before he goes in. Now, picture a soccer goalie halting play to walk 30 yards upfield and chat about tactics with a teammate. Everyone waits until the discussion ends and play resumes. But two minutes later the goalie stops play again to walk upfield again and talk to the same teammate, and never has to ask for a timeout. That’s what catchers do with regularity. But there is no need for it. They have signs. If they can’t keep the signs straight, then practice more. That should be on them, and not on the fans who suffer through the endless mound visits.  —   DAVID WALDSTEIN O the interminable glory of  ! O the joyous expectation that, for the willing surrender of a mere coin, we might see a match between the respective nines of New York and Chicago that could last to the End of Days! Imagine: Our sainted Christy Mathewson, “the Christian Gentleman,” twirling against those shifty   triplets, Tinker and Evers and Chance  —   forever. Be still my sclerotic heart. Alas, this cannot be. Our children have been raised without proper discipline (I, for one, am grateful to my dear pater for having once tied me to a tree after my refusal to eat a tomato that mater had so lovingly stewed). As a result, our youth lack the necessary patience for   so eager are they to return to their wireless devices and motorcars and  . Now the august custodians of our national pastime are forced to consider changes to the game’s sacred text. To which I say: Bosh! Forgive me, dear readers of the female persuasion, for my coarse language. But this cannot stand. Your humble scribe suggests the following. Make the distracting billboards along the outfield walls smaller. Order dawdling batsmen to step into the box  —   like men!  —   or pay the consequences of a first pitch thrown in their absence. Prohibit the spitting, the tugging of nether regions and other unseemly habits that waste time and offend refined sensibilities. We must address these matters posthaste, before some contraption of illumination is invented that leads to this game of sunshine being played at night. Then all will be lost it truly will be the End of Days.  —   D. FRANCIS BARRY Part of baseball’s charm is the quirks: No two games are the same. But long ones can leave an unfavorable impression on at least some fans, so here are some ideas on how to shave off some time. First, instant replay needs refinement. The time it takes for a manager to signal for a review, or for the umpires to rule on a play, needs to be shortened. Second, games can turn painfully slow in September, when rosters expand from 25 players to as many as 40. With so many relievers suddenly at their disposal, managers start to change pitchers with every batter. But the game should not be played by one set of rules for five months and then a different set in the final month. Perhaps allow teams to choose up to, say, 28 active players per game in September, but not 38. Finally, a more radical idea: Cut down on television commercial breaks, especially when they are longer during national broadcasts. Keep the flow of the game constant, and make up for the lost revenue by putting advertisements on the jerseys, as they do in soccer and will next season in the N. B. A.  —   JAMES WAGNER Ban all   armor and padding on batters  —   it’s an unfair advantage and wastes thousands of minutes as straps are adjusted between pitches. Prohibit any hitter from leaving the batter’s box once an   commences, except for obvious, debilitating injury (feeling uncomfortable at the plate does not count). The penalty for stepping out: A strike is called. Do it twice in one  ? Take a seat  —   automatic strikeout. Institute a pitch clock and strictly enforce it (a ball is called if the time expires). Any pitcher going over the clock more than five times is ejected, as with fouling out of a basketball game. Stipulate in the umpires’ union contract that each ump gets a $500 bonus for every game that ends in less than 2 hours 40 minutes. The bonus is $1, 000 for games ending in under 2 hours 25 minutes, and the entire umping crew gets the next weekend off, with pay, for games lasting less than two hours.  —   BILL PENNINGTON Enough about the idiosyncratic habits that obviously slow the game down, but are also part of the game’s natural appeal and help build drama. My advice is to shorten the game. No, I mean, really shorten the game. Reduce it to seven innings from nine. Beyond the time saved, think of the benefits in eliminating two innings. Starting pitchers would throw far fewer pitches, needing to only go four innings to record a victory. The scourge of serious arm and shoulder injuries would very likely diminish. Not having to rely on   mediocrity before getting to the   studs would also quicken the pace of games. Many games might take between two and two and a half hours, or the time it takes to play most soccer and basketball games. Games starting at 7 in the evening would be over by 9:30, making it easier for fans on work and school nights. After the seventh inning, everyone could get up, stretch and go home.  —   HARVEY ARATON Baseball is timeless, and often endless: enduring truths my friends and I came to appreciate as Mets fans in the empty upper decks of Shea Stadium in the early 1980s. Whenever those terribly played games got too long, copious inhalation helped along our Zen appreciation. Ah, the color schemes.   …     My mind is clearer now. So I’ll acknowledge that I like pitch and innings clocks. If batters haven’t adjusted gloves and cups, it’s too late to start once they step into the batter’s box. I’d limit coaching trips to the mound. Otherwise, leave the beautiful game alone. I don’t expect I will convince Commissioner Rob Manfred to put a sock in it. He is that neighbor puttering around his garage, tinkering with an old lawn mower. So here’s a thought: Forget putting a greased pig of a runner at second base in extra innings, and instead call the owners and general managers and urge them to hire blacks and Latinos and women. He’ll feel virtuous and his deeply white and male sport will benefit.  —   MICHAEL POWELL Enough of these suggested baby steps and timid tweaks to make baseball games shorter. It’s like trying to make a marathon markedly shorter by making it 26 miles, instead of 26. 2. Thanks for nothing. What baseball needs are a few spectacular changes to make it not only faster, but also more appealing to young fans whose attention spans have melted into the abyss of their iPads. Let’s get rid of the fourth ball, too. Let’s use a chain saw instead of a scalpel and say three strikes, three balls. Also, there should be no more free passes in this new world of speed baseball. Every foul ball would be counted as a strike. Make those changes, and the marathon becomes not much more than a 10K, just with hot dogs and beer, of course.  —   JULIET MACUR People keep looking for innovative ways to speed up the game, but baseball was played briskly for 100 years, so looking to the past may offer more answers. Specifically, we could look to April 16, 1993, when Mark Hirschbeck, a veteran umpire, decided there was someplace he would rather be than standing behind a catcher in San Francisco’s notoriously chilly Candlestick Park. With two outs in the ninth inning and one strike against him, Atlanta’s Ron Gant called for time and stepped out of the batter’s box. Unfortunately for Gant, Hirschbeck did not honor the request. Gant defiantly strode away from the plate and Hirschbeck, who perhaps had movie tickets or a late dinner engagement, ordered Rod Beck to start pitching. The Giants’ closer was happy to oblige, firing in another strike as Gant frantically raced back to the plate. There were plenty of words exchanged, but Beck ultimately retired Gant on a   to preserve a   victory. Laugh all you want about the thought of pitchers letting things rip regardless of whether the batter is in the box, but that game was over in 2 hours 16 minutes, and Gant probably thought twice for the rest of his career about calling a timeout.  —   BENJAMIN HOFFMAN I don’t want less baseball. I want less nonbaseball. Stepping out of the batter’s box to call a timeout, peer vaguely down the   line or scratch or adjust oneself is not baseball. Stay in the box. Pitchers aren’t blameless, either. Fondling the rosin bag or chatting with your catcher is not baseball. Pitch the ball. A visit to the mound? Let’s not. If you want to make a pitching change, just sound an air horn or something, have the pitcher leave the mound and have the new one come in. And he gets three   pitches, not eight. Come on, you’ve done this before! Vigilant and rigorous eradication of nonbaseball will give us the same dose of baseball in far less time.  —   VICTOR MATHER Several of our readers defended the game and its slow pace, claiming that the problem lay with the attention span of today’s viewers. Here are some of the best comments: Fix baseball? Fix baseball? I’ve got news for you. Baseball doesn’t need fixing! It is just about perfect the way it is. Oh, you in a hurry? Need to get back to the office? Well, then you don’t belong at a baseball game. What are you? From the MTV generation? Shorten the game? Please. You don’t go to a baseball game because you’re in a hurry. You go to a baseball game to relax and watch how it all unfolds. One of the great things about baseball is that there is no clock. You get to chill out, have a conversation or two, and take what amounts to a  . The game doesn’t need shortening and those who think it does need to go to a basketball game. Or a football game. Or any other sport with a clock, so you can make sure not to miss your dental appointment. Now, leave it alone!   —   Bill Leeman, San Rafael, Calif. **** As a practicing Buddhist, I try to live in the present moment at every moment. A slow baseball game allows me the opportunity to meditate between pitches, compose my soul with the personnel changes on the field, calm my feelings with foul balls and intentional walks, and generally muse about life, its vicissitudes and joys, throughout a   game. And how I miss the doubleheaders! May I suggest therapy for those sorry, frantic fans who have lost touch with their inner selves? Go to England and watch a cricket Test match. Go to Norway and watch their “Slow TV. ” Life is short. The calmer you are, the slower things are, the more life you have. Don’t fix baseball, FIX YOUR SOULS! Breathe!  —   David Glidden **** Why does baseball need fixing? Baseball isn’t checkers, it’s chess! It feasts on strategy. The visits to the mound the stepping out of the box the examination of the ball, the     tosses  —   all of it gives us the chance to restart our thoughts about how the next half inning is going to play out. The pitcher’s toss to hold a man on base provides an opportunity for something exciting to happen that can change the game. The same is true for throwing four intentional balls from the mound to the catcher. One of those pitches can go astray, or possibly be close enough to the strike zone to allow a batter to swing  —   and hit the ball to an unprepared second baseman or left fielder or whomever. Baseball is a great game the way it started. Get rid of the d. h.! That was the biggest mistake  —   and took all the fun out of the American League. Otherwise, LEAVE BASEBALL ALONE! Not every game needs to be played for television viewing.  —   Barbara Ames, Ponte Vedra Beach, Fla. The majority of our respondents agreed that baseball was too slow and offered  their opinions on how to fix it. Here is a selection from the submissions we received: If you accept that the problem with M. L. B. is that it moves too slowly and that the exciting moments are too few and far between, and that it takes too long to play, then I would fix it by borrowing from other versions of the game and other leagues: 1. Shorten the game to seven innings (like various youth and scholastic leagues) 2. Start hitters with a   count (like some recreational softball leagues) 3. Allow players to “foul out” with a   count (like some recreational softball leagues) 4. Move the fences in (similar to the N. H. L. effectively making goals bigger by making goalie pads smaller) to have even more home runs, and 5. Reduce the number of players on the field (like the N. H. L. ’s    overtime) to create more space for base hits.  —   Jacob Ritvo, Palo Alto, Calif. **** Fewer commercial breaks. I feel like this is easily the worst addition to baseball games and the worst contributor to wasted time and the No. 1 reason why I don’t watch baseball on TV and don’t love going to more than a few games a year. Commercials add another 45 minutes to an hour to a game! Alas, I feel that even if changes are made to the rules, nothing will change about ridiculous advertising time and thus games will still stay the same length. I’m there to watch baseball. That is why I bought a ticket  —   to view a live sporting event. I did not purchase a ticket to wait around for a commercial break on TV. And shorten pitcher changes and make the pitchers and batters go faster.  —   Mattie Vukmir, San Francisco **** Outlaw batting gloves, which slow down the game because of the ritualistic ripping and repositioning of the Velcro on them. They don’t loosen up that fast, dudes! This is also associated with the batters stepping out of the box after every pitch, a practice that should be prevented.  —   Gabriella Howard, Augusta, Me. **** Start every inning with a man at second base. Have that man be Bartolo Colon.  —   Howard Cole, Los Angeles **** You know how fans boo every time a pitcher throws over to first base in a halfhearted attempt to pick off a runner? Limit the number of times a pitcher can do that in any given   with a runner on first or third base. Say, the pitcher can attempt a pickoff throw twice, but then must throw home. If a runner is stealing second, the catcher has the better vision and ability to throw him out than the pitcher does, and if he’s stealing home, well   …     he’s probably not Jackie Robinson.  —   Max Rettig, New York **** After 11 innings, the home team can send up their best slugger (even if he was in the game and taken out). The visiting team can send out the pitcher of their choice for a   home run derby. If the home team hits a home run, they win the game. If they don’t, the visiting team wins the game.  —   Robert Azar, Brooklyn **** Every time there’s a pause in the game (a manager’s visit to the mound, a catcher’s visit to the mound, replay review, etc.) that’s long enough, the stadium plays music, and all players on the field not involved in the specifics of the incident must dance. I figure this will either result in fewer pauses because players don’t want to dance, or will make the pauses much more entertaining.  —   Rebecca Thorsness, Providence, R. I. **** Abolish the abominable   rule in the majors and minors.  —   Nelson Hernandez, Austin, Tex. **** How is it that a baseball game used to take two hours to complete and now can take up to four hours? The easy answer is to blame the players. And certainly they deserve some of it. But I believe that before commercial TV got involved, the time between innings was a lot shorter than it is now. With 17 changeovers in a full   game, that really lengthens a game. Of course, there is no such thing as a complete game for a pitcher anymore, and managers are prone to add to commercial timeouts with three pitching changes for each team. But before we add a clock on the players, let’s think about putting the clock on those who are off the field  —   managers and TV broadcasters.  —   Jeff Byron, Los Altos, Calif. **** If no one is on base, let the batter run in either direction  —   i. e. to first base or third. All batters and runners who follow have to go in the same direction until the bases are empty. This will bring an element of suspense and interest to the game.  —   Mark Flannery, Fullerton, Calif. **** To improve offense, eliminate radical shifts by fixing the locations of fielders within zones until the ball reaches the plate. Inspect   photos so the zones match what Ted Williams faced in 1941. Violations are errors.  —   Robert LaRose, Taiwan **** Relegation! Adopt the global soccer system of sending down the worst teams and bringing up the best from the level right below. This would inspire   teams to compete with the larger markets rather than muddle along for decades in third or fourth place. In addition, it would bring pro baseball to smaller markets and give those cities a taste of major league talent.  —   Kurt Gardner, Brooklyn **** Some of us like watching professional soccer in part because we know it will be a   game. You can count on it. Not so with M. L. B. Isn’t it ironic (moronic?) that M. L. B. officials are quoted as saying that they can’t shorten the breaks between innings because of the ad revenue that would be lost. So if I understand this, they’d rather have the dollars than the fans. What a strategy. How about this strategy  —   put the customers first by shortening the game, and that in turn would increase viewership and attendance and eventually maybe even increase revenues.  . This should be all about improving the customer experience. Once you do that, the data shows, you increase your revenues.  —   Dennis Stern, Lyme, N. H. **** Award multiple runs for gigantic home runs, much as the basketball   shot. This wouldn’t speed up the game, but it would add some excitement.  —   Steven Sherwood, San Francisco **** What if the batting order were eliminated? What if a manager could send up a particular player to bat as many times as he wanted in a game in whatever order he wanted? A batter could even get up consecutive times if he didn’t reach base. Presumably the team’s best hitters would get up over and over  —   maybe the best six would only see   and the other players on the team would be defensive specialists.  —   Alan Stricoff **** Legalize the use of certain   drugs, to be monitored by medical professionals. The drugs to be legalized should focus on maintaining health and recovering from injury. Sure, we’d have to consider stats and records from prior eras as distinct from current player accomplishments. But today, it appears we are at the point where “  drugs” is almost synonymous with “medical advancement. ” These guys play a lot of baseball. Healthier, better players spread across the league would be great for the game. And, yeah, keep the hitters in the box between pitches, too. It’s ridiculous already.  —   Dan Davidow, New Jersey **** Baseball is the sport where superstars have the least impact at the most crucial times. In every other sport the star can hit the big shot, throw the touchdown pass or score the goal when it counts. Here is my idea, and it’s radical for sure. In the eighth or ninth inning, the team at bat, if losing or tied, can advance the batting order back to the top of the order (one time only). We need more offense. More excitement. Let the best players put the bat in their hands against the best relievers at the most important times.  —   Doug Tumen, Woodstock, N. Y. **** Basically, I have only one problem with baseball that stops me from viewing a game at certain times, and that’s while I’m eating. And that problem is SPITTING! SPITTING! SPITTING! I don’t enjoy watching grown men, nor anyone for that matter SPITTING! It’s not pleasant, it’s not cool as most players and   think it is and it’s certainly not  . TV producers have an affinity for showing it but it needs to stop.  —   William McGrady, Piscataway, N. J. **** Easy fix: have one lineup for offense and one for defense (like the N. F. L. ). M. L. B. will get more hitting, more base running, more scoring   …     more excitement!  —   Larry Sternbach, Marlboro, N. J. **** One sure (and radical) way to speed up the game would be to make ALL foul balls be strikes no matter the count. If there are two strikes on the batter and he fouls a pitch off, he’s out.  —   Paul Morrison, Boston **** The biggest improvement M. L. B. could make is to institute an electronic strike zone. Aside from providing ultimate consistency and fairness to both pitchers and batters (and fans) the electronic strike zone would eliminate the hidden,   gamesmanship practiced by pitchers, batters, catchers and bench jockeys as they try to influence the umpires’ calls. Statisticians at Stanford have determined that   umpires are biased by game situations when calling balls and strikes (the same   pitch with the bases loaded is more likely to be called a strike than ball four).  —   Andreas Lord, Brookline, Mass. **** Why don’t we enforce the rules that already exist? Batters are supposed to stay in the box, and mound visits are limited to 30 seconds. The umps and baseball need to actually, and consistently, enforce this. What’s the point of the rule if no one pays attention to it?  —   Erika Crawford, Washington **** 10 contemplated rule changes for 2017 that would revolutionize the sport (time saved is per game): 1. After a home run is hit, the batter just touches home plate without running the bases. Average time saved: 98 seconds. 2. A pitcher gets one free strike per inning. Thus, a     count with the bases loaded and two outs becomes an inning ending   with a wave of the hand. Average time saved: 21 minutes. 3. If a team is ahead by more than four runs in the seventh inning or beyond, they forfeit their right to bat. Average time saved: 36 minutes. 4. One batter on the opposing team can be designated as ineligible for any game. The same player cannot be chosen more than once per series. Average time saved: 38 minutes. 5. The third inning, and any extra inning, is three balls and two strikes instead of four and three. Average time saved: 39 minutes. 6. Managers are eliminated. Average time saved: 56 minutes. 7. Home teams get to call games two hours after the first pitch is thrown. The dilemma is the team must make this choice before the game starts. Average time saved: 58 minutes. 8. One fan, coming to the park with two screaming children, is chosen to decide when he has had enough and wants to leave. At that point, everyone, including the players, has to go home. Average time saved: 78 minutes. 9. There can be only one pitching change per inning, and none in the second, fifth and eighth innings. If a game lasts more than 10 innings, the opposing squad gets to designate the pitcher( s) for the 11th and 12th innings. Average time saved: 81 minutes. 10. The season is reduced to 12 games. Average time saved: infinity, as baseball dies.  —   Robert Nussbaum, Fort Lee, N. J. **** Limit visits to the mound by players and coaches a team must use them the same way football, basketball, hockey teams use timeouts. A batter must always have one foot in the batter’s box. Batters must learn to stop fidgeting around they are professionals, not    kids. Shortstop and third baseman must be on the   side of second base, second basemen and first basemen must be on the   side of second base. Outfielders must stay in the outfield. This is before the pitch. Anything else is an illegal defense. Learn from basketball. This has nothing to do with the speed of the game but make “high socks” fashionable.  —   Vincent, Encinitas, Calif. **** Require all M. L. B. teams to designate a certain number of games (one per month, say) as “Youth Games. ” In a Youth Game, all tickets  —   and at least certain concessions  —   purchased by someone under a certain age (say, 16) would be STEEPLY discounted  —   say, by 90 percent or so. And, ALL tickets should be set aside for those games, so a box seat that might normally go for $150 would be only $15 and $20   seats would be $2. Teams might also consider ways to subsidize transportation to those games.  —   Ken Landau, Overland Park, Kan. **** One free pickoff attempt per   after that, each pickoff attempt counts as a ball. This will speed up the game and increase excitement with more stolen bases and runs.  —   Rick Dorfman, Boca Raton, Fla. **** Nine innings, nine positions. The players rotate one position each inning, as in volleyball. Players would be better rounded and the disproportionate importance of pitchers would disappear. Then I would watch it with interest.  —   Tom Jones, Boulder, Colo. **** Drop the fourth inning. Nothing ever happens in the fourth so just go from the third to the fifth. You would still have the ninth inning, and we would be there at least 20 minutes sooner.  —   John Connolly, Rockville Centre, N. Y. **** We were a little surprised at how passionate people were about this subject and how much thought they put into it  —   we received nearly 3, 000 submissions. If you would like to see some more ideas about how to fix the game, or why it should be left alone, we’ve published the best of the rest. 	1
230	Despite a brief   of controversy that preceded it, a conversation between Milo Yiannopoulos, the incendiary   author and lecturer, and Bill Maher, the comedian and host of HBO’s “Real Time,” on that program Friday night was a largely docile, chummy affair. There was little conflict or   as both men chided the political left for avoiding or drowning out Mr. Yiannopoulos’s views rather than engaging with them. Introducing Mr. Yiannopoulos, 32, an openly gay editor at Breitbart News, Mr. Maher said: “I think you’re colossally wrong on a number of things. But if I banned everyone from my show who I thought was colossally wrong, I would be talking to myself. ” Mr. Yiannopoulos began the interview by cracking jokes about gay people (whom he said he did not hire because they did not show up to work on time) and women, and telling Mr. Maher’s audience that they were “very easily triggered. ” “All I care about is free speech and free expression,” Mr. Yiannopoulos explained. “I want people to be able to be, do and say anything. These days, you’re right, that’s a conservative issue. ” Mr. Yiannopoulos had been scheduled to speak at the University of California, Berkeley, earlier this month, on an invitation from the school’s College Republicans group. But his talk was canceled when protests against the speech turned violent and led to rioting that caused about $100, 000 in damages. In January, when Mr. Yiannopoulos gave a lecture in Seattle at the University of Washington, a man was shot during protests outside the site of the speech. He spoke in December at the University of   where he mocked a transgender student while displaying her photograph during his talk. Other schools have withdrawn invitations to him in recent weeks. When it was announced on Wednesday that Mr. Yiannopoulos would be interviewed on “Real Time,” another scheduled guest, Jeremy Scahill, a journalist for The Intercept, said in a statement on his Twitter account that he was withdrawing from the show. “He has ample venues to spew his hateful diatribes,” Mr. Scahill said. “There is no value in ‘debating’ him. ” Mr. Maher followed with his own statement that said, “If Mr. Yiannopoulos is indeed the monster Scahill claims  —   and he might be  —   nothing could serve the liberal cause better than having him exposed on Friday night. ” In the interview on Friday night, Mr. Yiannopolous criticized female comedians like Amy Schumer and Sarah Silverman, and he described the Democrats as “the party of Lena Dunham,” the creator and star of “Girls. ” (Mr. Maher replied: “Let’s not pick on fellow HBO stars. There are so many other people. ”) Describing himself as “a virtuous troll,” Mr. Yiannopolous said, “I hurt people for a reason. ” He said people “want to police humor” because “they can’t control it. ” “Because the one thing that authoritarians hate is the sound of laughter,” Mr. Yiannopolous said. Mr. Maher added, “And also, because when people laugh, they know it’s true. ” Mr. Yiannopolous replied, “Nothing annoys people, or amuses people, like the truth. ” They then discussed an incident from last summer, when Mr. Yiannopoulos was banned from Twitter after helping rally other users to direct racist and sexist remarks at Leslie Jones, a star of “Ghostbusters” and “Saturday Night Live. ” “I didn’t understand, like, the ‘Ghostbusters’ thing,” Mr. Maher said. Mr. Yiannopoulos answered: “I wrote a bad review of a movie. Am I not entitled to do that?” After repeating some of the insults he had leveled at Ms. Jones, he said, “I simply don’t accept  —   I do not accept  —   that the star of a Hollywood blockbuster, that an     is crying over mean words on the internet. Get over it. ” “What actually hurts people is, like, murder, violence,” Mr. Yiannopoulos added. “That kind of stuff. ” He added that “mean words” don’t “hurt people. ” Mr. Maher said, “Which some people would say you have incited. ” Mr. Yiannopoulos reacted with surprise. “What? How?” he asked. “I’m just saying, some people would say,” Mr. Maher answered. Mr. Yiannopoulos replied, “Well, they would be idiots. ” Speaking to his audience, Mr. Maher said, “Stop taking the bait, liberals,” and asked how they could be afraid of someone he described as “little, British, impish” and a slur for gay people. The two men shook hands, and Mr. Maher moved on to his panel discussion. But in an   segment that ran after the HBO broadcast, Mr. Yiannopoulos said that transgender people were “vastly disproportionately involved in sex crime,” drawing jeers, boos and a shout of “liar” from Mr. Maher’s audience. Mr. Yiannopoulos also clashed with the comedian Larry Wilmore, another guest on the show. In remarks to Mr. Yiannopoulos that were bookended by an obscene phrase, Mr. Wilmore took offense at his Twitter trolling of Ms. Jones. “She’s a very thoughtful person and very funny,” he said. Trying to defuse the tension, Mr. Maher wryly suggested to Mr. Yiannopoulos that he shouldn’t be so quick to spar with his fellow panelists. “This is the beginning of your career,” Mr. Maher said. “People are only just starting to hate you. ”	1
529	 In a rare interview with Pokémon creator Satoshi Tajiri, he admits that the games were created as a backlash against his Christian parents. He also says that the games are tailored towards an anti-Christian sentiment or Satanism.The interview, conducted by Time about the continued success of the Pokémon series, took a sharp left turn when Tajiri was asked about the inspiration for the games. The following is an excerpt from the interview:[…]Tajiri: Yes. Pokémon is essentially the correct answer towards life, not Christianity. Everything presented in the game is the opposite of what Christians may believe. Some have said that the game promotes voodoo or magic, and I agree in the sense that there are many things that occur in nature that are unexplainable. Furthermore, the violence in the games is unparalleled. It may not show up in the actual graphics, but the brutality is made especially explicit in the Pokédex entries. Nature, again, played a big role.Time: So those who say that the game is anti-Christian are correct?Tajiri: I suppose so. I mean, some could say that the game supports Satanism. I don’t officially celebrate it, but I can understand why people would be attracted to it. After first coming up with the idea for Pokémon in 1990, Satoshi Tajiri labored for nearly six years over the original game. Now 34, he based it partly on things he remembered as a kid. The careful attention paid off. Pokémon swept Japan and is now doing the same in the U.S. and beyond. Spinoffs include trading cards as closely held as stock options, a TV series and, now, a movie. It’s the way I work. I sleep 12 hours and then work 24 hours. I’ve worked those irregular hours for the past three years. It’s better to stay up day and night to come up with ideas. I usually get inspiration for game designing by working this schedule.	0
812	  “Sarah Palin claimed today that Native Americans should leave America and go back to their homeland ‘Nativia’.In an interview with Fox News this morning, the former Alaskan governor was asked about her support of Donald Trump and his controversial views on immigration.“I love immigrants,” she told Fox and Friends host Steve Doocey, “But like Donald Trump, I just think we have too darn many in this country.“Mexican-Americans, Asian-Americans, Native-Americans – they’re changing up the cultural mix in the United States away from what it used to be in the days of our Founding Fathers.“I think we should go to some of these groups and just ask politely — would you mind going home? Would you mind giving us our country back?”“Sarah you know I love you,” Doocey interjected, “And I think that’s a great idea with regards to Mexicans.

715	 After Kentucky county clerk Kim Davis was invited to the State of the Union by some Republican putz who clearly thinks purposefully disobeying the United States Constitution is worthy of an invite, President Obama has made sure she doesn’t forget her crime of refusing to treat everyone equally under the law.Surrounding Davis will be four happily married same-sex couples who were married in Kentucky. Obama felt it would be poetic justice for the law-breaker, and if she’s going to be there anyway, might as well make her suffer in the bounty of same-sex love. Late Tuesday night, ahead of the president’s address, Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, the leader of the House Freedom Caucus, came forward, saying that his office had provided Davis’ ticket to the Family Research Council and Davis.The Huffington Post reported that the Ohio Republican did not know that his ticket went to Davis until after her announcement, and initially knew only that it was going to the Family Research Council.“Our staff heard from the Family Research Council that Ms. Davis and her family hoped to attend the State of the Union address and so we offered a ticket,” Jordan told ABC News in a statement later on Tuesday.

59	The Knicks, who were already raising dysfunction to an art form with bad basketball and   Twitter posts from their famous team president, moved further into the surreal on Friday when the team’s owner announced that he was indefinitely barring one of the most popular players in franchise history from Madison Square Garden. The owner, James L. Dolan, can go years without engaging with the news media. But on Friday, he went on the radio to say that Charles Oakley, a stalwart member of some outstanding Knicks teams from the 1990s, would not be let into the Garden as a result of an altercation on Wednesday night that ended with Oakley being led from the arena in handcuffs while fans chanted his name. It was hard to find precedent for the Knicks’ decision  —   former players are normally treated like celebrities, not told they will not be allowed into a game even if they buy their own ticket  —   but it fit the almost bizarre image the franchise now seems to be busy creating for itself. Dolan, who announced the decision on Michael Kay’s afternoon program on ESPN Radio, said he was taking the step to bar Oakley out of concern for the safety of the team’s other paying customers. “We need to keep the Garden a place that’s comfortable and safe for everybody who goes there,” Dolan said. “So anybody who comes to the Garden  —   whether they’ve been drinking too much alcohol, they’re looking for a fight, they’re abusive, disrespectful to the staff and then fans  —   they’re going to be ejected and they’re going to be banned. ” Several times over the course of the   interview, Dolan described Oakley’s behavior on Wednesday night as out of line. Dolan also said that Oakley “may have a problem with alcohol” and that Oakley needed to seek help to control his anger. If Oakley were to address his behavioral issues, Dolan said, the Garden would most likely welcome him back. Oakley, 53, has long been estranged from the Knicks and has had an adversarial relationship with Dolan. But he has insisted he was not acting inappropriately on Wednesday night when he sat down not far from Dolan to watch the Knicks play the Los Angeles Clippers. A number of fans who were sitting near Oakley said they had not seen or heard him being belligerent. Other fans suggested that he seemed somewhat combative. In any case, after security guards approached him, a shoving match ensued, and that was followed by the    sight of Oakley being grabbed and led away. But many things with the Knicks are not easy to fathom. Their starting point guard, Derrick Rose, went AWOL for a day. The team itself has lost 20 of its past 26 games, continuing a run of futility that has dominated Dolan’s two decades as owner. And the team president, Phil Jackson, mimicking Dolan, has not spoken with reporters who cover the team since September. Jackson’s few communications have come via an isolated interview or two and occasional Twitter posts, some of them cryptic. But despite the little that he has said, he has still managed, at various moments, to anger both LeBron James and Carmelo Anthony. And although he seems intent on trading away Anthony, the Knicks’ only star, Jackson has a problem: Anthony’s   clause. Asked about Jackson during the radio interview, Dolan asserted that he would stay out of his way despite the dismal results Jackson has produced in his nearly three years as team president. He said he would honor Jackson’s   contract “all the way to the end. ” But while Dolan has long been unpopular in New York and Jackson does not have many admirers these days, Oakley has plenty of support. The incident on Wednesday led to an outpouring of acclaim for him, not only from the team’s frustrated fans but also from current and former N. B. A. players, who have long admired the tough work ethic that Oakley displayed on the court. Given all the negative fallout from Oakley’s ejection, Dolan was asked in the interview whether the organization now felt embarrassed. “Well, I certainly think Charles should be embarrassed,” he said. Oakley, who was reached by telephone after Dolan’s radio interview concluded, said that he had not listened to the broadcast but had already heard about some of Dolan’s comments. “Nothing they’re doing makes sense,” Oakley said. “I mean, this man, something’s wrong with him. He crossed a bridge the first night, and then he’s been crossing another bridge every day since. ” Oakley, who has acknowledged that he had a couple of drinks before he arrived at Wednesday’s game, declined to address Dolan’s statement that he might have problems with alcohol. “I don’t talk about that stuff,” he said. “I have no comment on that. I don’t have to defend myself on that. The people around me know if I have a drinking problem or not. ” Asked if he planned to pursue legal action against Dolan or the organization, Oakley said, “We’ll see what happens. ’’ Oakley later wrote on Twitter that he was planning to hold a news conference next week. Meanwhile, neither Oakley nor those backing him are liable to take kindly to repeated suggestions by the Knicks  —   the first came in a statement on Wednesday night  —   that Oakley needs some kind of “help” for his behavior. Instead, there was more support for Oakley, with Michele Roberts, the executive director of the National Basketball Players Association, weighing in after Dolan’s interview. “Painful to believe that my last image of Oak at MSG is him dragged out of the arena,” Roberts wrote on Twitter. “Is that how we remember our Legends? #NoBan. ” Dolan said he hoped that Oakley would not be barred forever. He said he would love to honor Oakley at midcourt along with several of his former teammates  —   again, provided that he seeks help. “But his behavior, it just doesn’t work with that,” Dolan said. “Until he can address it and get it under control, then we probably won’t be able to do it. ’’ Dolan said it was clear to him that Oakley had gone to Wednesday’s game with an “agenda” to be disruptive. Oakley never should have been allowed to take his seat, Dolan said, which he cited as one of his reasons for firing Frank Benedetto, the Garden’s senior vice president for security, on Friday morning. Benedetto, who previously served with the United States Secret Service, could not be reached for comment. Dolan recalled how, during the first quarter of Wednesday’s game, a security guard approached him to relate that he and his   were having difficulties with Oakley. Dolan said he had asked if they could wait to deal with the problem between quarters to avoid a big scene on national television. The security guard agreed with him, Dolan said, but the situation escalated. “And I said, ‘You’ve got to do what you’ve got to do,’” Dolan said. “It wasn’t until it was pointed out to me that he was behind us, I sort of opened my ear and started to hear and what I heard was terrible,’’ Dolan added. At one point during the radio interview, Dolan was reminded that he does not give many interviews. “No,” he said, “this isn’t my favorite thing. ” Nor, no doubt, is watching his team lose again, which the Knicks did on Friday night at the Garden, falling to the Denver Nuggets,  . Dolan sat in his customary seat near the court. Oakley, meanwhile, was absent, except for the chants bearing his name.	1

431	WASHINGTON  —   Facing a fierce backlash after she called historically black colleges and universities “real pioneers” of school choice, Betsy DeVos, the education secretary, spent Tuesday afternoon backtracking on the controversial statement and highlighting the institutions’ roots in racism and segregation. Ms. DeVos, in a series of Twitter posts on Tuesday and in remarks at a luncheon with presidents from some of the schools, repeatedly acknowledged that the schools were not created simply to give   students more choices but because black students across the country were not allowed into segregated white schools. The controversy is the latest gaffe for Ms. DeVos, who has had a rough start. Since Vice President Mike Pence cast the tiebreaking vote to confirm her, Ms. DeVos has fled from a small group of protesters who temporarily blocked her from entering a school, been criticized by a middle school’s administrators for saying their teachers were in “receive mode,” and suffered through the embarrassment of the Education Department misspelling the name of the civil rights icon W. E. B. Du Bois in an official tweet. The latest controversy began on Monday evening when Ms. DeVos released a statement shortly after meeting with several presidents of historically black colleges and universities. In it, Ms. DeVos began by praising the schools for making “tangible, structural reforms” that allowed students, often underserved, to reach their full potential. “They started from the fact that there were too many students in America who did not have equal access to education,” she said in the statement. “They saw that the system wasn’t working, that there was an absence of opportunity, so they took it upon themselves to provide the solution. ” Historically black colleges and universities “are real pioneers when it comes to school choice,” the statement continued. “They are living proof that when more options are provided to students, they are afforded greater access and greater quality. Their success has shown that more options help students flourish. ” On Twitter, hundreds of angry users accused her of ignoring the fact that many of the schools were founded because black students were not allowed to attend segregated white schools, not because education pioneers wanted to give   more options in higher education. Many accused her of using the nation’s history of segregation to advance a contemporary political agenda. Representative Barbara Lee, Democrat of California, said the comment was “tone deaf. ” Senator Claire McCaskill, Democrat of Missouri, called the statement “totally nuts. ” Kristen Clarke, president and executive director of the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, was biting. On Tuesday afternoon, Ms. DeVos seemed to backpedal on her statement at a luncheon for the school presidents at the Library of Congress. “Bucking that status quo, and providing an alternative option to students denied the right to attend a quality school is the legacy of HBCUs,” she said, according to prepared remarks released by her office. “But your history was born, not out of mere choice, but out of necessity, in the face of racism, and in the aftermath of the Civil War. ” She added that historically black colleges and universities “remain at the forefront of opening doors that had previously been closed to so many,” and that the schools “made higher education accessible to students who otherwise would have been denied the opportunity. ” Ms. DeVos later published several tweets repeating those sentiments in an effort to clear up her earlier comments. Still, Ms. DeVos in her speech referred to Mary McLeod Bethune, a famous civil rights activist and educator, as a leader who “is less well known than others in the HBCU legacy. ” Ms. DeVos said Ms. Bethune, who founded   University in Daytona, Fla. inspired her because she recognized that traditional school “systemically failed to provide   access to a quality education  —   or, sadly, more often to any education at all. ” Ms. DeVos, an aggressive backer of publicly funded vouchers that public school students could use for private school tuition, also used her speech before the presidents of several historically black colleges and universities to highlight school choice programs. She pointed out that her friend and a black woman attending the luncheon, Denisha Merriweather, had been raised by a single mother in poverty, failed the third grade twice, but is now scheduled to graduate in May with a master’s degree because a family member intervened in her life “with the assistance of a school choice program in Florida. ” Ms. DeVos also mentioned an executive order signed by President Trump on Tuesday afternoon dealing with historically black colleges and universities. A White House official said the order was designed to more closely coordinate the White House with efforts to increase funding to the schools and to encourage more private groups and organizations to work with the schools.	1
146	DENVER  —   In the basement of a white stone church here on Tuesday night, Jeanette Vizguerra gathered up her three youngest children, slipped them into pajamas and asked herself perhaps the hardest question of her life. Should she present herself to the immigration authorities Wednesday morning for a scheduled   risking deportation? Or should she stay in the church, one of the few places federal agents do not go, almost surely resigning herself to months or years trapped inside? “Tonight, I have to think,” Ms. Vizguerra said. “Because I promised my children  —   and it was a promise  —   that it was going to be very difficult to remove me from this country. I have already fought so long to be here now is not the time to give up. ” It has been a difficult week for Ms. Vizguerra, 45, one of millions of undocumented immigrants contending with an uncertain future in the Trump administration. After she was convicted several years ago of using fake documents, Ms. Vizguerra, who has spent 20 years working in the United States, was ordered out of the country. But she was granted at least five postponements of deportation, and in December, her lawyer, Hans Meyer, asked for another. Nothing happened. She was due for a regular   at the local office of Immigration and Customs Enforcement on Wednesday, and as the day crept closer, Ms. Vizguerra realized the possibility that she could be whisked onto a plane and separated from her three   children: Zury, 6, Roberto, 10, and Luna, 12. Their care would fall to her husband, Salvador, 45, who works long hours as a driver for a tile company, and an older daughter, Tania Baez, 26, a preschool teacher with three children of her own. Unlike her younger siblings, Ms. Baez is not a citizen by birth, but she has a work permit under the Obama administration’s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which President Trump criticized during the campaign but has not moved to end. The last week or so has thrust the family into a state of extended emergency. On Feb. 5, Ms. Vizguerra called a family meeting over dinner, banning electronics from the table to convey the seriousness of the matter. The family cats, Miranda and Zayra, meowed as she explained the plan. If officials were to come to the home in the days before the meeting at the I. C. E. office, no one should answer the door, she said. If they gained entry, Luna, a reedy middle schooler with braces, should use her phone to film the events. Roberto should open the emergency contact list in his phone and begin to call family friends and advocates. And Zury, the youngest, should go straight to her parents’ bedroom, close the door and stay there. “I told them, ‘I know it’s going to be difficult for you,’” Ms. Vizguerra said. “‘I want you to be brave. ’” Three days later, the packing began, with the children stuffing their mother’s leggings, sweaters and shampoos into suitcases and boxes. Terrified by the prospect of familial separation, Ms. Vizguerra began to consider taking refuge at the First Unitarian Society church in Denver, whose congregants previously gave sanctuary to another immigrant. She reminded Luna which drawers belonged to which child and told her it would be her job to make sure her siblings dressed properly. She showed her where the extra soap, toothbrushes and toothpaste were kept. Then Ms. Vizguerra stocked the refrigerator with microwave dinners, something even a    could make. Ms. Baez, the oldest daughter, has begun contemplating caring for three more children. “I completely understand his side,” she said of Mr. Trump. “But he grew up entitled. He’s never lived in poverty. He’s never lived in fear. ” “I just think if he walked an immigrant’s life,” she added, “he’d change his mind. ” Ms. Vizguerra came to the United States from Mexico in 1997. She worked as a janitor and a union organizer, and she later owned a moving and cleaning business. In 2009, she was caught with fake identification that her lawyer said she had acquired in order to work. She pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor, setting off a chain of events that led to the deportation order. In the Denver area, she is a   advocate for immigration overhaul. Ms. Vizguerra’s situation  —   first the government ordered her to leave, then it allowed her to stay  —   is reflective of   immigration policies that his critics called muddled and inconsistent. And even as Mr. Obama allowed some people to stay here, he deported millions of others. “I am hoping,” said Tom Tancredo, a former Colorado congressman and a prominent critic of illegal immigration, “that the ‘Trump raids’ will eventually net the numbers Obama rounded up in his raids. ” Mr. Trump has done away with the Obama administration’s policy of prioritizing the most serious criminals for deportation, making anyone with a record a candidate for quick removal. Now Ms. Vizguerra and others like her are worried that immigration officials will no longer give them a pass. On Tuesday night, she slept in the church basement with her three youngest children, to avoid the risk of arrest at home. At that point, she still had not decided whether to show up at her I. C. E. meeting. “My intuition,” Ms. Vizguerra said, “tells me that if I go in, I’m not coming out. ” When the time came on Wednesday, she decided not to go. Then Mr. Meyer, her lawyer, learned that Ms. Vizguerra’s request for another “stay” of her deportation had been rejected. Ms. Vizguerra’s supporters held a news conference outside the I. C. E. office, and she telephoned in. With the phone pressed against a megaphone, she explained why she did not show up: “In my heart,” she said in Spanish, “I knew that they would deny me a stay. ” As of Wednesday evening, she was still at the church, staying in a room she helped prepare three years ago, when she and other immigrant advocates thought it would be a good idea to create a safe space for people facing deportation. She chose the yellow paint for the walls. The room holds two beds, a lamp propped on a cardboard box, and a Valentine from her youngest daughter. “I could be here days, months, maybe even years,” she said. Under federal policy, immigration officers are supposed to avoid entering churches and other “sensitive locations,” unless they have advance approval from a supervisor or face “exigent circumstances” that require immediate action. There was no sign of I. C. E. agents Wednesday evening outside the church. Shawn Neudauer, a spokesman for I. C. E. would not say what the agency planned to do next.	1
374	JACKSONVILLE, Ark.  —   On a frigid morning here, Nancy Godinez was piling bread and other staples into her car outside a food pantry. She had lost her job as a custodian, her unemployment checks had run out, and her job search had proved fruitless. One thing she still had was health insurance, acquired three years ago after Arkansas’   legislature agreed to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. The coverage, she said, has allowed her to get regular checkups and treatment for tendinitis in her foot. But unless she finds a new job, Ms. Godinez, 55, could be at risk of losing her insurance, too. Gov. Asa Hutchinson is among a number of Republican governors hoping to impose a work requirement on Medicaid recipients. They believe that extending Medicaid to millions of   adults without disabilities under the health law gave them an incentive not to work. Since its creation as part of President Lyndon Johnson’s Great Society agenda in the 1960s, Medicaid has grown to become a robust safety net program for poor Americans, providing health care for 74 million people. The new Republican ideas for the program, including work requirements and changes in how it is paid for, could make Medicaid much more limited, with a smaller impact on the federal budget but more obstacles to becoming and staying enrolled. The outline of a new replacement plan, presented to House members last week, shows just how far some Republican leaders hope to go in overhauling a program that has grown under the Affordable Care Act to insure one in five Americans, including more than half of the roughly 20 million people who have gained coverage under the health law. It would give each state a fixed amount of money for each Medicaid beneficiary, instead of paying a large share of whatever it costs to cover everyone who qualifies. And it would substantially reduce the amount that the federal government pays to help cover the Medicaid expansion in Arkansas and 30 other states, a change that would most likely result in many people losing coverage. In return, states would get far more freedom to structure their Medicaid programs as they wished. Now, even as divisions among Republicans in Congress slow efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act, Mr. Hutchinson and other Republican governors are developing proposals to require many Medicaid recipients to have a job, participate in job training or perform community service. “It gives dignity it gives responsibility,” Mr. Hutchinson said in a recent interview at the State Capitol. “And if somebody wants to say, ‘That’s not for me,’ if they’re   they ought to be kicked off the system. ” Work requirements have long been central to the Republican goal of instilling a sense of “personal responsibility” in people who benefit from government programs. But it was an Arkansas Democrat, Bill Clinton, whose embrace of work requirements for welfare recipients when he was governor became the basis for the 1996 federal welfare law enacted during his presidency. In fact, 59 percent of nondisabled adults on Medicaid do have jobs, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. But advocates for the poor say   people often face numerous roadblocks in finding work. Some have criminal records. Others lack a cellphone or reliable transportation, said Mandy Davis, a social worker at Jericho Way, a resource center for the homeless in Little Rock. “  America believes in work because we do it ourselves,” Ms. Davis said. “But we have resources, an education, transportation, a supportive family. ” Mr. Hutchinson and a few other governors, including those in Arizona, Indiana and Montana, have already sought work or   requirements for those who received Medicaid under the expansion over the last few years but were rebuffed by the Obama administration. President Barack Obama would allow them only to refer Medicaid recipients to   programs, with no requirement that they participate. One early indication of the Trump administration’s stance will be whether it approves Kentucky’s request to require   Medicaid recipients to either work, enroll in school, get job training or volunteer 20 hours a week. Gov. Matt Bevin, a Republican, submitted the request last year. President Trump’s nominee to run the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, Seema Verma, a health policy consultant, helped with the proposal. Ms. Verma has also helped other Republican states push for, and in some cases win approval of, new rules for Medicaid enrollees, including charging them premiums and temporarily revoking coverage from those who fail to pay the premiums. It was Mr. Hutchinson’s Democratic predecessor, Mike Beebe, who got the state’s   legislature to expand Medicaid by using federal funds to buy private insurance for the poor. Mr. Hutchinson said in the interview that he wanted to continue the expansion here, but that if the federal government stopped paying most of the cost as the health law requires, “we’ll just have to look at it again. ” He said he would either seek the Trump administration’s permission to impose a work requirement or seek a block grant  —   and, with it, leeway to create new rules  —   to cover those who newly qualified for Medicaid under the health law. As a rough model, Mr. Hutchinson pointed to a work requirement for certain food stamp recipients  —   a federal policy that was part of the landmark 1996 welfare overhaul  —   that Arkansas reinstated last year. Under that rule,   adults without dependents cannot receive food stamps for longer than three months unless they are working, volunteering or getting job training for 20 hours a week. States were allowed to suspend the requirement during the recession, but most have brought it back as unemployment has dropped. It generally applies to adults ages 18 to 49 unless they are pregnant, have dependent children or are medically certified as “unfit for employment. ” Since Arkansas reimposed the work requirement last year, its food stamp rolls have lost about 36, 000 people, according to the State Department of Human Services. Mr. Hutchinson said the drop was partly explained because people had found jobs, but advocates for the poor said many appeared to have been cut off. For now, Arkansas is sending letters to Medicaid enrollees to let them know they are eligible for “free job search assistance,” including career counseling and help writing résumés. The state is putting together a system to keep track of those who take advantage of the offer and whether they end up finding jobs. Many Medicaid recipients here already have   jobs, but roughly 40 percent report having no income, according to the state. “If you look at the statute, it is one of the purposes of Medicaid to help people attain independence and ” said Dennis Smith, senior adviser for Medicaid and health care reform at the Arkansas Department of Human Services and a Medicare and Medicaid director under President George W. Bush. But Leonardo Cuello, director of health policy for the National Health Law Program in Washington, said work requirements for Medicaid recipients would very likely be challenged in court. “Applying work requirements to health coverage gets it exactly backward,” he said. “An individual needs to be healthy to work, and a work requirement may prevent them from getting the health care they need in order to be able to work. ” Christopher Caveney, 38, of Blytheville, recently found   work as a security guard after a long recovery from surgery to remove a benign tumor in his spine. Mr. Caveney has Medicaid coverage but lost his food stamps last fall because he was not working the required 20 hours a week. “I went from being able to eat vegetables to eating Hamburger Helper every day,” said Mr. Caveney, who earns $10 an hour. “I think most people want to work, but I also know a lot of people work when it’s not necessarily in their health’s best interest. ” Mr. Cuello also said it would be difficult for states to determine which of their Medicaid enrollees were truly capable of work. Someone may be legitimately disabled but not yet approved for disability benefits, for example. That is the case with Jimmy T. Brunson, 44, whose diabetes has caused painful neuropathy in his feet. Mr. Brunson, who was playing dominoes one recent morning at Jericho Way, a resource center for the homeless, said he sporadically found temporary jobs but had a hard time keeping them because of the pain in his feet. Mr. Brunson said he had qualified for Medicaid under the health law and was using it to get his diabetes medication. If a work requirement was imposed, “I’d probably be out,” he said. “Even though sometimes I can get a job, you’ve got to understand  —   sometimes I can’t even walk. ” Daniel   a Medicaid recipient who makes a modest income singing at churches around Little Rock, said he worried that a work requirement would reduce the Medicaid rolls without connecting many people to jobs or training. “Are these   centers going to be robustly funded and have the means to identify prospective employers and make matches happen?” asked Mr.   29, who is also a graduate student at the University of Arkansas. “I worry that this is all for show. ” But even some of Arkansas’ poorest residents are quick to say public benefits should be conditioned on work. “I’m glad we have it, but people should have to do something for it,” said Ms. Godinez, who had stopped by the Fishnet Missions Food Pantry in Jacksonville, outside Little Rock. “This is America, right? You’re supposed to work for what you get. ” Some who make a living helping the poor also said they were strongly against providing a public benefit to those who are physically able to work but do not. “If you’re of able mind and body, you should be able to make something happen for yourself,” said Edward Brown, the daily operations manager at Stewpot, a soup kitchen in Little Rock. “But some people just don’t want to work  —   they’re too taken care of. ” Dewey Sims, the founder and chief executive of Fishnet Missions, which runs the food pantry here, agreed. “I ain’t got no damn entitlement,” he said. “I earned everything I got. ”	1
156	JAKARTA, Indonesia  —   The Christian governor of the capital of Indonesia, the world’s most populous   nation, has been fighting for his political life in an election campaign charged with religious and ethnic undertones. After voters went to the polls Wednesday, it appeared that he would have to fight a little longer. Unofficial results from the balloting in Jakarta, the capital, indicated that the governor, Basuki Tjahaja Purnama, held a small lead over his nearest challenger but was unlikely to win more than half of the vote. If the official results confirm that, a runoff will be held April 18. Mr. Basuki, who is ethnic Chinese, has been hobbled by a criminal trial on a charge of blasphemy against Islam, in connection with remarks about a Quran verse that he made last year. Mr. Basuki and his supporters say the court case, which was preceded by mass protests in the capital by Islamists demanding that he be prosecuted or even lynched, was orchestrated by political opponents to sabotage his election campaign. Analysts also saw the furor over Mr. Basuki’s remarks as an attempt to weaken President Joko Widodo, a key ally of the governor who is expected to seek a second term in 2019. Mr. Basuki, widely known by his nickname, Ahok, is only the second   governor of Jakarta, and if he wins, he will be the first   to be elected to the post directly. He was elevated from deputy governor in 2014 after Mr. Joko, his predecessor, was elected president. Hours after the polls closed Wednesday, independent polling firms conducting   quick counts  —   which are taken from small samples of ballots cast and which have been highly accurate in past elections  —   put Mr. Basuki in the lead with 43 percent of the vote, and Anies Baswedan, a former minister of education and culture, in second with 40 percent. Other counts had Mr. Basuki ahead by slightly different margins. A third candidate, Agus Yudhoyono, a former army officer and son of a former president, Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, was shown finishing a distant third with around 17 percent. Both of Mr. Basuki’s opponents are Muslim and Javanese, the dominant ethnic group on the island where Jakarta sits. Indonesia’s population of 250 million includes more than 190 million Muslims, but it has influential minority populations of Christians, Hindus and Buddhists. While    issues like education, health care, transportation and infrastructure development are important to voters, the campaign for governor has been overshadowed by issues of religion and race that have scarcely been seen before in Indonesia’s democratic era.   and   slurs directed toward Mr. Basuki have spread widely on social media in recent months. “One has to admit that Ahok did remarkably well considering the type of campaign that has been mounted against him,” said Jeffrey A. Winters, a professor of politics at Northwestern University who is a longtime observer of Indonesian affairs. “This is the first time a Chinese Christian has run for a major office in Indonesia, and he came close to winning an outright majority despite being on trial for blasphemy and attempts by his opponents to turn it into an   choice,” he said. “Jakarta voters have shown themselves to be incredibly tolerant, which is a plus. ” However, analysts said Mr. Basuki’s failure to win the election outright in the first round could be his undoing, because most voters who supported Mr. Agus were expected to then back the   campaign of Mr. Anies, who has promoted his religious credentials. “The political identity in Indonesia is more fragmented now because Anies will be branded as the representative of Islam and Ahok as the representative of ” said Titi Anggraini, executive director of the Association for Elections and Democracy, a nongovernmental organization based in Jakarta. “Based on my calculations, it will be difficult for Ahok now,” she said. Mr. Basuki was charged with blasphemy months after lightheartedly citing a verse in the Quran last September that warns Muslims against taking Christians and Jews as friends. He said that given Indonesia’s transition to democracy in the late 1990s, it would be acceptable for Muslims to cast ballots for a Christian. The ensuing attacks against him by Islamist groups and his political opponents came despite a   regulation against using religion and ethnicity as issues in political campaigns. After the unofficial results were released, Mr. Basuki rallied his supporters, reminding them that he still came in first place despite the religious and ethnically charged atmosphere. “Considering that at one point, no one wanted to touch us, there are still many people who believe in us,” he said. “We believe this struggle is not over yet. ” Mr. Anies tried to play down the impact of Islamist attacks on Mr. Basuki, telling his supporters that “eventually, the public wants change. It’s not related to   politics, but the public’s needs. ” Earlier Wednesday, however, at a polling station in a firehouse in a   neighborhood in South Jakarta, Sari Rahayu, 47, a teacher who was wearing a Muslim head scarf, or hijab, said religious sentiments had indeed influenced her vote for Mr. Anies. The Quran, she said, made it clear that Mr. Basuki was not an option. “We’re not allowed to choose a leader who is not Muslim,” she said. She said that Mr. Basuki did a good job in office but added, “He doesn’t have the right to speak about the Quran. ” Still, the governor has no lack of support among Muslims, who make up the majority of voters in Jakarta. Anshori, an exporter who, like many Indonesians, goes by one name, went to the same firehouse with his wife and daughters, who were in hijabs and the checked shirts that Mr. Basuki’s supporters have long worn. “He’s honest. No corruption. He’s firm,” Mr. Anshori said. “We’re not angry about the religious attacks it’s just something we have to face. ”	1

Emergency personnel were summoned and exhaustive attempts were made to revive him, but since Mr. Richards was not dead, that was deemed unnecessary.”	0
460	WASHINGTON  —   Russian aircraft mistakenly bombed Syrian Arab fighters who were being trained by the United States, the commander of the   operation in Iraq and Syria said Wednesday. American advisers were about three miles away when the Russian strike occurred. The episode pointed to the risk of unintended clashes among the myriad forces operating on a fluid battlefield in Syria, as the American command looks toward the fight to retake Raqqa, the Islamic State’s de facto capital in the country. Lt. Gen. Stephen Townsend, who commands the   task force that is fighting the militants in Iraq and Syria, said the strike by Russian and Syrian government planes led to casualties among the Syrian fighters, but he declined to say how many were hurt or if any were killed. He added that the Russian attack appeared to have been a mistake: The Russian military thought it was bombing villages held by the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, when in fact they were recently occupied by Syrian Arab fighters. “We had some Russian aircraft and regime aircraft bomb some villages that I believe they thought were held by ISIS,” General Townsend said in a video news conference with reporters at the Pentagon. “Actually on the ground were some of our Syrian Arab coalition forces. ” A spokesman for the   command in Baghdad said that the Russian airstrikes took place about 10 miles southwest of Manbij. The Russian bombing stopped after American military officers at the air war command in Qatar called their Russian counterparts in Syria. In Moscow, the Defense Ministry asserted that the United States had provided the coordinates of   forces in northern Syria before the airstrikes and that Russian and Syria warplanes had not struck any areas that had been properly designated. “No airstrikes were carried out by either Syrian or Russian aircraft in areas designated by the U. S.,” the ministry said in a statement. The battlefield in northern Syria is crowded with a diverse array of forces near Al Bab, including   Syrian militias, Syrian government forces, Kurdish and Arab fighters backed by the United States, and ISIS militants. “Around Al Bab, all the forces that are acting in Syria have converged literally within   range of one another,” General Townsend said. There has been a similar convergence of forces to the east where Syrian government forces have advanced to the point where they are within “rifle range” of Syrian Arab fighters backed by the United States who are defending the area around Manbij, the general added. “It’s very difficult and complicated,” he said. General Townsend said the United States was encouraging all sides to focus on the fight against the Islamic State and not let tensions among groups divert them from the need to take Raqqa. “That’s what we ought to keep our efforts focused on and not fighting deliberately or accidentally with one another,” he said. This is the second time in recent weeks that there has been an episode of   friendly fire involving the Russians. Last month, Russian fighters mistakenly bombed Turkish soldiers near Al Bab. The Russian airstrikes also raise the question of whether the American military needs to broaden its dialogue with Russian commanders over operations in Syria. Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr. the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, met last month in Azerbaijan with Gen. Valery V. Gerasimov, the chief of the Russian general staff. It was their first meeting and the discussion included how to “enhance communications,” the Pentagon said. Discussing the fighting in Iraq, General Townsend also said that some   Islamic State fighters had sought to escape from Mosul disguised as civilians, but that they had been detained. He said that there were 12, 000 to 15, 000 ISIS fighters in Iraq and Syria, some 2, 000 of them in western Mosul and in and around the nearby town of Tal Afar. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis has presented the White House with his recommendations on how to step up the military campaign against ISIS, which President Trump vowed to “demolish and destroy” in his address to Congress on Tuesday. General Townsend suggested that he did not foresee the United States “bringing in large numbers of coalition troops” to help with Iraq and the assault on Raqqa.	1
911	 Tito and Amanda Watts were arrested over the weekend for selling “golden tickets to heaven” to hundreds of people. The couple, who sold the tickets on the street for $99.99 per ticket, told buyers the tickets were made from solid gold and each ticket reserved the buyer a spot in heaven — simply present the ticket at the pearly gates and you’re in.“People can sell tickets to heaven,” a Jacksonville police spokesman said. “But the Watts misrepresented their product. The tickets were just wood spray painted gold with ‘Ticket to Heaven — Admit One’ written in marker. You can’t sell something as gold when it’s not. That’s where the Watts crossed the line into doing something illegal.”	0
897	 Immediately following her interview, in which Miley Cyrus confessed to being “the least judgmental person in the world” and “understanding and accepting of everyone,” she started her next show by setting a Bible on fire.In an opening act for her recent concert at the Staples Center in Los Angeles, Cyrus walked out onto the stage and held the Bible out to the crowd saying, “Here is a tribute to all you Jesus-lovers out there.” She then set the pages on fire and yelled “Hillary ’16!” before dropping the book to the ground. As the music started, Cyrus began to sing while squatting over the burning Bible and performing a sexually provocative dance with repetitive thrusting hip movements, called ‘twerking.’After the concert, Cyrus told the journalists that her actions were meant to raise awareness and understanding of the downtrodden segments of our society. “Being a role model for millions of people, I know no better way to express the massive amount of love I have for the world, and if some crybabies are upset about it, they’re idiots and I hope they die,” Cyrus said before sticking out her tongue and suggestively spreading her legs for the cameras.	0
430	Penguin Random House will publish coming books by former President Barack Obama and the former first lady Michelle Obama, the publishing company announced Tuesday night, concluding a heated auction among multiple publishers. The terms of the agreement were not disclosed, but publishing industry executives with knowledge of the bidding process said it probably stretched well into eight figures. Robert B. Barnett and Deneen C. Howell of Williams  Connolly represented the Obamas. Penguin Random House acquired world rights to the books, and worldwide sales could be substantial. No decision has been made yet as to which of the company’s major imprints  —   which include Random House, Doubleday, Alfred A. Knopf and Crown  —   will publish the books. Mr. Obama’s previous books were published by Crown, which also published Mrs. Obama’s book “American Grown,” about the White House garden. A spokeswoman for Penguin Random House would not say whether the books would be memoirs and referred questions to representatives of the Obamas. Speculation about the Obamas’ books and how much they would sell for have been circulating in the industry in recent weeks, as executives at the top publishing houses met separately with the former president and first lady. Some publishing executives who followed the bidding process said that the opening offers for Mr. Obama’s book alone were in the $18 million to $20 million range. The publisher plans to donate one million books in the Obama family’s name to First Book, a nonprofit organization that provides books to disadvantaged children, and it will continue to provide digital copies to Open eBooks, which grew out of the 2016 White House digital education initiative. The Obamas also plan to donate part of their advances to charity, including the Obama Foundation. “We are absolutely thrilled to continue our publishing partnership with President and Mrs. Obama,” Markus Dohle, the chief executive of Penguin Random House, said in a statement. “With their words and their leadership, they changed the world, and every day, with the books we publish at Penguin Random House, we strive to do the same. Now, we are very much looking forward to working together with President and Mrs. Obama to make each of their books global publishing events of unprecedented scope and significance. ” The Obamas’ advance is likely to exceed even the stratospheric figures that other recent presidents and first ladies have received. Former president Bill Clinton sold his memoir “My Life” for more than $10 million, and Hillary Clinton reportedly received an $8 million advance from Simon  Schuster for her memoir “Living History. ” George W. Bush’s memoir “Decision Points,” became a hit, selling about two million copies and earning him an estimated $10 million. (Mr. Barnett, a   lawyer, has handled many of these lucrative deals and represents some of the capital’s most powerful players, including the Clintons Mr. Bush and his wife, Laura Bush Speaker Paul D. Ryan and former Vice President Dick Cheney.) It is unusual, however, for a former president and first lady to make a collective deal for their memoirs, and some publishing industry insiders said that early on the process, it appeared that the books were going to be auctioned separately. (It is possible, and perhaps likely, that the books will be published by different imprints in the Penguin Random House conglomerate, which could also help the company absorb the cost of a large advance, by sharing it between imprints.) Mr. Obama has a proven track record in publishing as an author of multiple best sellers. His three books  —   “Dreams From My Father,” “The Audacity of Hope” and “Of Thee I Sing”  —   have sold more than four million copies. According to financial disclosures, he earned more than $10 million from those titles. Reviews have praised him as a gifted prose stylist. But a postpresidential memoir has even greater potential to be a critical and commercial hit. Mr. Obama kept a journal during his time in office, which suggests his memoir could include    moments that were captured as major events unfolded. A frank discussion of his time in the White House, and of issues like race relations in America, could reach an even wider audience, becoming a worldwide blockbuster. Penguin Random House, a global publishing house with more than 250 imprints, has worldwide rights to the books, which means the company can make a good deal of money overseas and in translation. For the Obamas, the books may be valuable beyond the   advances. The deal was announced, probably coincidentally but somewhat awkwardly, on the night that President Trump gave his first address before Congress. These books could provide a chance to reframe and highlight the former president’s legacy, at a moment when a new Republican administration is making an effort to dismantle some of his signature legislation.	1
371	BEIJING  —   After approving plans on Friday for informal talks in New York between a North Korean delegation and former American officials, the Trump administration reversed course hours later, withdrawing approval for the North Koreans’ visas, two people who were to take part in the planned talks said. The schedule called for the two sides to meet in early March, and arrangements were underway for the   North Korean group, led by Choe   who runs the American affairs bureau of the North’s Foreign Ministry, to travel to New York. The organizer of the talks, the National Committee on American Foreign Policy, led by Donald S. Zagoria, was told by the State Department on Friday morning that the visas would be granted. But the decision was reversed in the afternoon when “someone overruled State,” said one person who planned to participate in the talks. Both of the people on the participants’ list spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the delicacy of the matter. The reversal came as the Malaysian government announced that VX nerve agent, a chemical on a United Nations list of weapons of mass destruction, was used to kill the estranged half brother of the leader of North Korea at the Kuala Lumpur International Airport on Feb. 13. South Korea has accused North Korea’s leader, Kim   of ordering the killing of his half brother, Kim  . Just days before Mr. Kim’s death, North Korea launched a new type of   missile, apparently timed to coincide with the visit of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan to the United States. News of the missile test arrived as President Trump and Mr. Abe were eating dinner at    the president’s   club in Palm Beach, Fla. At first, the North Korea developments did not appear to deter the State Department’s plan to move ahead with the talks. The use of the VX nerve agent was already known when Mr. Zagoria got the green light about the visas on Friday morning. The missile test was on Feb. 11. The State Department also knew about tough comments Mr. Trump made about the North Korean leader during an interview with Reuters on Thursday. “It’s very late,” Mr. Trump said when asked whether he would meet with Mr. Kim. “We’re very angry at what he’s done, and frankly this should have been taken care of during the Obama administration. ” The decision to reverse the initial approval for the visas came hours later on Friday afternoon, one of the people who planned to take part in the talks said. But it was clear, that person said, that a senior official in the State Department, the White House or elsewhere in the government had second thoughts about issuing visas to representatives of North Korea in light of recent events. “I suspect it was a combination of the VX attack and the president’s personal pique that caused the reversal,” the person said. “Someone obviously looked at the fact that the United States was going to issue visas to representatives of a country that had just violated international law, carried out a murder and intentionally violated the sovereignty of another country, and decided, ‘Maybe this isn’t such a good idea. ’” While the talks were unofficial, they were seen as a test of the willingness of the Trump administration to begin serious negotiations at a later date, or to send a special American envoy to North Korea. Several prominent nuclear weapons experts have urged Mr. Trump to send an envoy, arguing that President Barack Obama’s refusal to engage with the North allowed it to make significant advances in its nuclear weapons program. “Every six to seven weeks North Korea may be able to add another nuclear weapon to its arsenal,” Siegfried S. Hecker, emeritus director of the Los Alamos National Laboratory and a senior fellow at the Center for International Security and Cooperation at Stanford University, said in a recent   article. The leader of the North Korean delegation, Ms. Choe, planned to travel to New York in her “nongovernmental” role as president of North Korea’s Institute for American Studies. The American participants were mostly former officials who had dealt with North Korea over many years. Some of them have participated in similar gatherings with North Koreans organized outside the United States. But more weight was given to the New York gathering because it was taking place at the start of the new administration. During his election campaign, Mr. Trump said he was open to meeting with the North Korean leader over a hamburger. The Americans in the group represented a wide range of views on North Korea. Winston Lord, a former ambassador to China who was on the list of participants, recently wrote in a dissent to a report for the Asia Society that the United States should immediately step up sanctions on North Korea. Others in the American delegation were Robert L. Gallucci, a negotiator on North Korea during the Clinton presidency Victor Cha, a senior adviser on North Korea to George W. Bush and Evans J. R. Revere, a former principal deputy assistant secretary of state specializing in North Korea. Mr. Gallucci and Mr. Cha wrote a report for the George W. Bush Institute last year that emphasized the human rights abuses in North Korea. As well as holding discussions about the North’s rapidly expanding nuclear program, the American delegation was planning to talk with the North Koreans about two Americans now detained in North Korea.	1
113	WASHINGTON  —   On Monday, Michael T. Flynn resigned as President Trump’s national security adviser after admitting he had misled Vice President Mike Pence about his phone calls with a Russian diplomat. In his resignation letter, Mr. Flynn “sincerely apologized” to Mr. Pence and Mr. Trump, blaming the fast pace of events for what he called his “incomplete” account. Mr. Flynn has a   history with Russia, but there is still much about the case that is not clear. ■ In December 2015, Mr. Flynn, then retired from the Army, attended a  dinner to celebrate the 10th anniversary of RT, a Russian     news channel that disseminates Russian views on global affairs. He sat at a table with President Vladimir V. Putin, spoke beforehand and subsequently appeared on RT as a commentator. ■ Mr. Flynn had multiple conversations with Russia’s ambassador to the United States, Sergey I. Kislyak, before and after Mr. Trump’s November victory. He spoke to the envoy after President Barack Obama announced new sanctions against Russia to punish it for interfering in the American election. Mr. Putin did not retaliate for the sanctions, which surprised Obama administration officials but drew praise from Mr. Trump on Twitter: “I always knew he was very smart!” ■ Mr. Flynn and other Trump officials, including Mr. Pence and Sean Spicer, the press secretary, denied that Mr. Flynn had raised sanctions in the phone call with Mr. Kislyak. Mr. Spicer said the call had focused on the logistics of a planned phone call between Mr. Trump and Mr. Putin after the inauguration. Mr. Flynn later backed away from that assertion, saying his memory might have been faulty. In his resignation letter, he said he had “inadvertently” misled Mr. Pence. ■ The Justice Department told the White House about the contents of Mr. Flynn’s conversation with Mr. Kislyak, which had been recorded by a government wiretap. ■ The F. B. I. interviewed Mr. Flynn just days after he took office. Shortly thereafter, the acting attorney general, Sally Q. Yates, warned that Mr. Flynn was susceptible to blackmail by the Russians because he had misled Mr. Pence and other officials. Mr. Trump fired Ms. Yates in an unrelated incident after she said the Justice Department would not defend his executive order on immigration. ■ It is not clear whether Mr. Flynn’s conversations with the Russian ambassador were directed by, or carried out with the knowledge of, the   or any of his other senior advisers, including the chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon. It is also not clear why the White House did not act earlier on the information given to it by the Justice Department. ■ The precise nature of the conversation between Mr. Flynn and Mr. Kislyak has not been made public. Did Mr. Flynn explicitly reassure the Russian government that the incoming administration would ease sanctions? Did he urge the Russians to hold off on imposing retaliatory measures? ■ How did Mr. Flynn’s dealings with the Russians affect American policy toward Russia? As a candidate, Mr. Trump called for warmer relations between the United States and Russia  —   a message echoed by Mr. Flynn, who said it could be a partner in the fight against the Islamic State. Yet two weeks ago, the ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki R. Haley, declared that the United States would not lift sanctions on Russia until it withdrew from Crimea and stopped destabilizing Ukraine. ■ What is the status of the F. B. I. investigation of Mr. Flynn’s phone calls? Did he break any laws in his conversations with Mr. Kislyak? What did he tell F. B. I. investigators? Has Mr. Flynn hired his own lawyer? And what will he do now?	1
494	He is a wealthy international entrepreneur known for generous donations to his alma mater, Harvard. Now a court says the university must cooperate in a hunt for his assets. A federal judge in Boston has ruled that Harvard must provide testimony and produce documents disclosing the bank accounts, routing numbers, wire transfers and other interbank messages used by an alumnus, Charles C. Spackman, to send the university money. Mr. Spackman, a Hong   businessman, leads the Spackman Group, a global investment holding company with $1. 5 billion under management. The ruling places the Ivy League college in the uncomfortable predicament of revealing confidential financial information gleaned from the donations of an influential benefactor. No small donor, according to his company website, Mr. Spackman sponsors a scholarship fund for Asian students at Harvard, leads the   Scholarship Council and has served as a   of reunion gifts for the class of 1994. That is the year Mr. Spackman  —   also known by his Korean name, Yoo Shin Choi  —   obtained an undergraduate degree in economics. A spokeswoman for Harvard, Melodie Jackson, said the university would not comment on the court order. The Boston ruling is part of a   quest by an aggrieved investor, Sang Cheol Woo, to collect on a judgment against Mr. Spackman involving a South Korean business deal. For Harvard, the case could have   implications, according to Douglas A. Kellner, a Manhattan lawyer who specializes in recovering hidden assets worldwide. “If he diverted funds to Harvard when he should have been paying his judgment, that’s a fraudulent transfer,” Mr. Kellner said. “They could sue Harvard to get the money back, and they’d be entitled to get it back if they can show that it was fraudulently transferred. ” John Han, a lawyer with the firm Kobre  Kim, which is handling the investor’s case, said the firm had no plans to sue Harvard, which he said had been unwittingly entangled in the dispute. The collection effort dates to the stock collapse in 2001 of Littauer Technologies Company Ltd. an information technology company. The Seoul High Court said that Mr. Spackman, a major investor in the company, fled South Korea amid claims of stock price manipulation, departing before the Korean authorities arrested a business partner. The Korean court later ruled that Mr. Spackman and other insiders profited by selling their shares before the collapse while minority shareholders, including Mr. Woo, suffered enormous losses. The court ordered Mr. Spackman to pay Mr. Woo $4. 5 million in 2011, a judgment that has now mushroomed to $12 million because of accumulating interest. The managing director of the Spackman Group, Richard Lee, said the company would not comment because a related lawsuit is pending in Hong Kong. In documents filed in 2014, the company said that Mr. Spackman had not appeared in court in South Korea because he was unaware of the case until just before the High Court ruling  —   which was later overturned by the Supreme Court for all defendants except Mr. Spackman. It was upheld for him because he did not appear in court to defend himself. While acknowledging that Mr. Spackman was fined $40, 000 by the Korean authorities in connection with the Littauer matter, Mr. Spackman “maintains he did not commit the offenses,” the documents said. Mr. Woo’s lawyers argue that efforts to collect on the judgment have been hampered by what court papers called a “mazelike network of offshore nominees and trusts (many of which are managed by close family members and classmates from Harvard). ” For example, the estate where Mr. Spackman lives  —   in a section of Hong Kong that Forbes has described as “the wealthiest neighborhood on earth”  —   is owned through a series of shell companies, a Hong Kong company in turn owned by a British Virgin Islands company, court papers say. The Boston ruling, entered Feb. 21 by Judge William G. Young of Federal District Court, gives Harvard until March 20 to turn over the banking information. It also orders Mr. Spackman’s daughter, Claire Spackman, a sophomore at Harvard, to testify and turn over records about her father’s assets. Mr. Spackman, an American citizen and permanent resident of Hong Kong, is well known in South Korea, partly because he is the son of James C. Spackman, who was adopted by Americans in 1955 after his biological parents died during the Korean War, and later advanced in the business world to become chief of Prudential’s international insurance group. The holdings of the younger Mr. Spackman’s company include the Spackman Entertainment Group, which produced the 2013 science fiction movie “Snowpiercer,” starring Tilda Swinton and Octavia Spencer.	1
845	   This article says a man cut of his own penis to prevent masturbation? Is this true?   Paramedics and police were called to Jonas Etcher’s mobile home Tuesday night after a frantic call came from his mother saying her son had sawed off his penis with an electric carving knife.“He’s really been struggling with masturbation,” Ellen Etcher told WRDW. “He knows it’s against Jesus, but has been self-pleasuring up to a dozen times a day. He can’t seem to find a girl to get his sex urges out on … we’ve tried Match.com, Craigslist.”Etcher, 52, believed he would go to hell if he didn’t stop masturbating. So he took drastic measures by cutting off what he called his “sinful part.”	0
987	 For eight years, Michelle Obama genuinely thought she was a queen and expected to be treated like one. Now that she’s a regular citizen, she’s having a hard time of letting go of her former status as the (failed) first lady and keeps trying to push her way into every major social scene where she doesn’t belong and is apparently not invited.When she heard the news that Prince Harry was marrying a black American girl, she assumed it was her place to be on that guest list, which has to be approved by the Queen of England herself. Michelle made a desperation move to sneak a spot on that exclusive guest list and as soon as the real queen found out what the wannabe royalty did, she delivered a brutal beatdown that was definitely deserved. Invitations to Royal weddings in England have traditionally been extended to the sitting President of the United States and the current First Lady, so when Queen Elizabeth saw what Michelle Obama was up to – trying to sneak a spot at the wedding at the expense of the real POTUS and FLOTUS – she delivered Michelle a well-deserved and humiliating beatdown.While Barack Obama has been traveling around the world, operating as some kind of shadow president and attempting to undermine the real POTUS, Michelle has been trying to push her way into every major social event where she doesn’t belong and is apparently not invited.When Michelle Obama heard the news that Prince Harry was marrying a black American girl, she assumed it was her rightful place to be on that guest list. Michelle made a desperate move to sneak a spot on the guest list, but unfortunately for the former First Lady, the guest list has to be approved by the Queen of England herself. The guest list hasn’t been set for the royal wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, but a number of things could stand in the way of President Donald Trump getting an invite.But a former U.S. president might make the list, due to his friendship with the young British royal: Barack Obama and his wife, former first lady Michelle, who appear to have amiable relations with Harry and his elder brother and future king, Prince William, the Duke of Cambridge. Kensington Palace announced that the royal couple would not be inviting political leaders to the event, at least not on the basis of their official position. Which means neither US President Donald Trump nor his predecessor Barack Obama will be there. Not even British Prime Minister Theresa May was deemed worthy of a place on the guest list.Instead, only personal friends of the couple will be inside Windsor Castle for the royal event of the year on May 19.“It has been decided that an official list of political leaders — both UK and international — is not required for Prince Harry and Ms. Markle’s wedding,” a Kensington Palace spokesman said. “Her Majesty’s Government was consulted on this decision, which was taken by the royal household.”A White House official confirmed neither Trump nor first lady Melania were invited; nor was Prime Minister May, Downing Street said.A royal source said that while Harry and Meghan hoped to see Barack and Michelle Obama soon, the former US President and his wife would not be at the wedding. The source would not say definitively whether the Obamas — who are close to the royal couple — had been invited.Unlike the wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge in 2011, this royal wedding is not an official state occasion and is regarded as a private ceremony, so there is no onus on the couple to invite political leaders.	0
503	 Rumors had been floating around the 2016 Democratic National Convention all week about a “special surprise speaker” set to address the crowd on its final day. That speaker turned out to be Kermit Gosnell, infamous abortion provider and barbaric serial killer of born-alive infants, who was beamed in to speak Thursday from the Huntingdon prison where he is currently serving life without the possibility of parole.After being introduced as “champion of women’s rights, martyr for the greater cause, and fearless liberator, Dr. Kermit Gosnell,” the audience erupted into a frenzied applause which lasted more than ten minutes. Planned Parenthood CEO Cecile Richards, who was in attendance, became overcome with emotion and fainted, according to reports from the convention.Once the cheers and cries of “Free Kermit! Free Kermit!” died down, the horrific mass murderer addressed the people from the dark prison room where, after Barack Obama reportedly “pulled some strings with officials,” he was allowed the opportunity to give the speech.

86	(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the  .) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. President Trump’s latest meeting with a foreign leader, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada, went smoothly. They pledged cooperation on trade, investment and border security. And, joined by Ivanka Trump, they met with female executives and announced an initiative to assist women in business. In private talks, Mr. Trudeau was expected to welcome the prospect of renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement, a move that could test his commitment to internationalist principles. _____ 2. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan was greeted with higher approval ratings when he returned home from his weekend golf outing with Mr. Trump in Florida. But there was surprise in the United States as it became clear that the two leaders discussed their response to North Korea’s missile test in full view of diners at Mr. Trump’s    resort, with aides pointing the lights from their smartphones at briefing documents. North Korea claims its launch shows progress toward   capabilities. The National Security Council, normally the president’s main arm to develop foreign policy, is in turmoil from top to bottom. Michael Flynn was said to have resigned as national security adviser following reports that he had misled Vice President Mike Pence over his contacts with Russia. _____ 3. On the homefront, Mr. Trump’s nominee for Treasury Secretary, the financier Steven Mnuchin, was confirmed by the Senate. And Republicans are hitting a roadblock in their quest to “repeal and replace” the Affordable Care Act: Constituents upset that there is no plan to replace it have made themselves heard at public meetings in California, Utah and Wisconsin. “I’d be lying to you if I told you it was fun,” said Representative Jim Sensenbrenner of Wisconsin, who faced a frustrated crowd on Saturday. _____ 4. Inside Trump Tower, the president’s sons talked to The Times about pressing on with global deals  —   and rebutting waves of criticism over ethical concerns. “His DNA will always be in the company in a big way,” Eric Trump said during nearly five hours of interviews over two days last week. “His DNA built the company. His DNA also built us. We’re extensions of him in so many ways. ” _____ 5. More harrowing details about the suffering of civilians in the Syrian city of Aleppo: Canisters of chlorine gas, a banned weapon, were dumped on residential areas at least eight times in the final weeks of the battle to retake the city from rebels, Human Rights Watch reported. And a separate analysis drawing on satellite images, security videos, social media and TV footage indicates that Russia, contrary to its repeated claims, bombed a major hospital in the city multiple times. _____ 6. A California dam’s spillway appears to have stabilized, but evacuation orders remain in place for more than 180, 000 people as state authorities try to make emergency repairs before more rains come. Emergency shelters filled with residents while workers and experts swarmed the Oroville Dam, the tallest in the United States. “The big fear, again, is that potential for catastrophic failure,” one official said. _____ 7. Modern goddesses ruled the Grammys: Adele and Beyoncé brought dramatic spectacles. The big story after the show, though, was the   of Beyoncé in the top categories. “It was #GrammysSoWhite come to life,” our critic writes. We rounded up the best and worst of the performances, and here’s the red carpet. _____ 8. The American College of Physicians offers a new way to take care of your lower back pain: Wait it out. Take some aspirin if you really need it. Concerned about the epidemic of opioid addiction, the group says patients should try exercise, acupuncture, massage or yoga before resorting to prescription drugs. _____ 9. The dairy industry wants us to call almond, soy and coconut milk   …     something else. Dairy farmers are calling on Congress to stop makers of increasingly popular   alternatives from labeling them yogurt, milk or cheese, saying consumers could mistakenly equate their nutritional profiles. Our reporter wonders: “What about other nondairy products with dairy names? Will milk of magnesia, cocoa butter, cream of wheat and peanut butter have to change their names as well?” _____ 10. Finally, a reminder you may not need: Tomorrow is Valentine’s Day. We’d like to draw your attention to one of our most popular articles ever: “The 36 Questions That Lead to Love. ” In our latest Modern Love podcast, the actor David Oyelowo reads “Seeing the World Through My Wife’s Eyes,” about a man whose spouse helps him cope when he loses his sight. And our “Committed” series explores the   history of wedding announcements in The Times, with updates on noteworthy couples, milestones like the first gay wedding announcements and some pretty amazing wedding fashions, like those big pouffy ’80s gowns. _____ Photographs may appear out of order for some readers.

614	 Marine veteran and Medal of Honor recipient Kyle Carpenter was recently informed that his award, the highest for valor in the armed services, will be rescinded because he failed to complete a mandatory annual training course while on active duty. A recent Headquarters Marine Corps (HQMC) review of his records shows that he did not complete the online “Driving in Icy Conditions” course in 2010 while he was deployed to the violent city of Marjah, Afghanistan.Many Marines are calling for the award to be reinstated, but Sgt. Maj. of the Marine Corps Ronald L. Green says there’s no place for “tough guys” like Carpenter being honored in today’s Corps, whose main mission is to fight things like social injustice and hurt feelings.“Any motivator can block a grenade blast with his face and selflessly save a teammate’s life under a hail of withering enemy gunfire,” said Green, from his air-conditioned office in Virginia. “But it takes a true Marine to listen to that creepy guy in S-2 give a three-hour PowerPoint on STDs, and that’s the message Marines need to hear.” Since 1797, Duffel Blog has been serving the men and women of the American military with insightful commentary and hard-hitting journalism. While other agencies have sometimes run from possibly scandalous stories, Duffel Blog has been known to be edgy and ahead of its time, almost as if they could see into the future. After reporting on President John Adams’ $200 per week cocaine habit in March 1799, Duffel Blog was named The American Military’s Most-Trusted News Source by the Columbia Journalism Review and the nickname stuck.Duffel Blog is sometimes referred to as “The military version of The Onion,” but this is a popular misconception. The misnomer was cleared up in May 2012 when DB staff successfully conducted an airborne assault on the offices of The Onion News Network so that others would know “The Onion was actually the civilian version of Duffel Blog.”	0

She’s controversial, but she’s one of the good ones.” All news articles contained within National Report are fiction, and presumably fake news. Any resemblance to the truth is purely coincidental.	0
55	LOS ANGELES  —   Alex R. Hibbert eyed a group of six children whipping red and yellow balls at one another in a large, reverberant pit made with trampoline floors and walls. He wanted in. But one player needed to get nailed by a ball and knocked out of the game first. He stood in line, his feet fidgeting, before bailing. He ran over to a nearby trampoline, pulled up his hoodie, crouched down and launched himself first upward and then backward into a flip. “You bend your feet, keep your hands all the way and jump as high as you want,” he said. “You get maximum air. Once you hit the air then you flip. But you don’t want to do too much because you might do a double flip. ” Alex is the    actor who plays Chiron (also knows as “Little”) in “Moonlight,” the    film about growing up in a   area of Miami as a character in the process of understanding his sexuality. The film has received eight Academy Award nominations, including best picture. In real life, he lives in Miami, where he is a   student, but he was recently in Los Angeles for a busy weekend of award shows (he attended both the Producers Guild Awards and the Screen Actors Guild awards) and auditions. So he would have a proper tux to wear to the SAG awards, he also had to stand still for a suit fitting. That’s a lot for an energetic kid. A few hours at the Sky Zone trampoline park in the Van Nuys neighborhood was his   play time. “I’m open,” he yelled, his arms spread wide. A ball came straight at his head and he ducked. Then he grabbed it and hurled it at the opposite side of the dodgeball pit, which now had him alone against three boys. He came to the tables, out of breath but happy. “It’s a battlefield out there,” he told his mother, Donna Wellington. “But I’m coming out on top. ” He grabbed for a cherry Icee she was holding for him and took a big gulp. Ms. Wellington snagged it. “Don’t drink all of that,” she said to her son. “You’ll get a stomachache. ” He made a face, then set the drink down. He has gotten a lot of attention because of his ability to make faces. “Moonlight” opens with a scene focused on Alex, but it’s not until about 10 minutes into it that he actually has a line. Critics and moviegoers have been taken by Alex’s performance, most of it delivered without any words, in which he communicates the adolescent angst of a young boy growing up in an environment where his sexuality is not understood. “Mahershala taught me a lot of tips about facials,” he said of his   Mahershala Ali, whom he calls his second father. “He was all like, ‘Just think about the moment that is going on. ’” Alex didn’t grow up as an   kid looking for a big break. He was living a typical life when stardom found him. He was born in New York City, and lived in Queens until 2011, when his mother decided to move with him to live closer to her own mother. (Alex has one sister, Robin, 22, from his father’s side, who lives in New York with their father.) He goes to a performing arts magnet middle school in Miami Gardens, Fla. loves science class (even though he said school was “mostly boring,” he knows it will help him succeed in his life’s ambition of curing cancer) and is expected to help out at home by doing the dishes and taking out the trash. But in March 2016, Alex’s drama teacher, Tanisha Cidel (she played the role of the principal in the film) suggested to him that he audition for “Moonlight. ” He assumed it was a school production. “I didn’t know it was going to be that big,” he said. “I thought it was going to be like a play or something. ” It was Alex’s grandmother, Hillary Frye, who took him to the “Moonlight” audition. She is now his unofficial publicist. “Every day since the film came she buys a New York Times paper at the   and looks for Alex’s picture in it,” Ms. Wellington said. “She’s going crazy, she tells everyone at work, ‘That’s my grandson! ’” His mother is trying to adapt to the new normal of having a son who suddenly is invited to award shows and auditions. So long as the hoopla doesn’t interfere with school, Ms. Wellington is accommodating. On Monday, it was back to their normal routine. “Nothing changed,” said his mother, who works at a nursing facility. “When I travel back and forth, I go right back to work. And Alex goes back to school. ” But he had a few days of glamour before he returned to real life, and some time before the media crush to just be a little kid. After dominating the trampoline, the foam pit, air hockey and the dodgeball court, he had by now moved on to the basketball   game. Before his mother could even make her way over, he had racked up 41 points. “I beat the record,” he hollered to her. He sidestepped to the adjacent machine where he tossed the ball some more, to the tune of 43 points. In celebration, he dabbed. He wasn’t done, though. He was ready for more dodgeball. It was 8 p. m. and his mother wasn’t. “Alex, I’m tired,” said Ms. Wellington, who had just accompanied her son to London, where Alex accepted an award on behalf of Mr. Ali. “Mom, one more game,” he pleaded. She gave him a    —   apparently a talent for nonverbal communication is a family trait. “O. K.,” he said, “I guess it is time to go. ” Anyway, he will need his sleep, given the magnitude of his dreams. There is the whole   thing. He would also like to have an acting career like Denzel Washington, to do action movies like Andrew Garfield and get cast on a popular TV series. “I want to be on ‘The Walking Dead,’” he said. “I need to talk to my managers about that. ”	1
714	 Jesus Ramon Sanchez, from the Little Havana neighborhood in Miami, was allegedly attempting to engage in sexual intercourse with a 4-year old male pit bull, when the dog defended itself by tearing off the man’s genitals with its teeth … According to witnesses, 4-year old Spanky, was playing with his owner in the park when Mister Sanchez grabbed him and attempted to rape him. The male pit bull violently resisted and severely injured its attacker’s legs, arms and groin.“The dog was just running around, playing with a ball, when the man came out of nowhere and tried to grab it,” says Dorothy Steinberg, a witness of the events. “The man had his pants down and was struggling with the dog. Everyone in the park was just stunned and nobody did anything, but the dog defended itself and bit back. In a matter of seconds, he grabbed the man’s genitals with its teeth and literally tore them apart.” WNDR assumes however all responsibility for the satirical nature of its articles and for the fictional nature of their content.

883	   With the major publicity of the Iwo Jima/gay pride flag comparison photo going viral, it is a disappointment to me that, what appeared to be Jennifer Aniston’s account is receiving all the attention from a powerful statement stolen from my original post. It is why, when the post was stolen by the owner of this Jennifer Aniston account, I made the comment that I did not appreciate the post being taken from my page — DV Dan — without any credit.As the statement was made by myself, an actual U.S. Marine Veteran, it would have been nice to direct that attention to a much higher cause than gossip. Such as the fight we continue to face daily in the Veteran community. Our goal with Dysfunctional Veterans, DV Farm, DV Radio, and DV TV is to bring awareness to the estimated 23 a day. Suicide prevention and veteran support is something that actually needs the national attention behind it, not the color of a celebrity dress.As I made the post I did based on how I felt the depiction of the pride flag being raised in that manner disrespected the Marines and Navy Corpsman that fought, bled, and gave the ultimate sacrifice during WWII. The original post had been pulled due to constant reporting of it, and I was getting messages from veterans who felt offended by the depiction. They were offended due to not reading my words condemning the picture, they just saw the image and, like myself, knew it was wrong. I will state again that I have nothing against the LGBT community, however as it is their right to publicly call out what they find offensive to their cause. It is my same right to express what I feel is offensive to the veteran community. As it is also their right to portray “Art” in any fashion, there should have been more respect and consideration given toward the Men and Women that protect those constitutional rights.You may not agree with my views on this issue, however, one should not be hypocritical in the ways others express their views. Hate can be a two way street, not one with a one way sign. I hope the real Jennifer Aniston will see this message and contact me as she is gaining a lot of support for my statement.It would be a nice gesture to show her what we do within the DV community to bring both humor and seriousness into Veteran lives through the Dysfunctional Veterans Facebook Page.  Along with that, it would be great to show her how we work with Battle In Distress to combat the 23-a-day and reduce that number down to 0.  	0

It's happening.— Pamela Cooper (@takingitall2000) July 25, 2015  DEARBORN, MI – The Muslim-majority City Council of Dearborn has quietly passed a new ordinance to ban the sale of alcohol within the city limits, also making the very possession of the substance a crime with a mandatory one year jail sentence and $6,000 fine if convicted.The new law has been passed after years of pressure by the local Islamic community who have claimed that the very existence of such products is offensive and infringes on their religious and personal freedoms. Soon after the law passed, local Muslim community leaders declared the passing of the law a “victory over the Western oppression of Islamic culture.” Dearborn Police Chief, Ron Haddad, vowed to raid every single liquor store and grocery that still sold alcohol after the August 15 deadline for businesses to clear their shelves of what is now officially labeled “sinful and offensive products.” Haddad has in the wake of the movement proudly proclaimed on Twitter, “It is a great honor that Allah has chosen me for his will to turn Dearborn into an Islamic State.”	0
326	Good morning. (Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the  .) For many Californians, the drought now feels long gone. According to the latest figures from the United States Drought Monitor, about 17 percent of the state remains under “moderate drought” conditions or worse. This time last year, it was about 95 percent. But not everyone is rejoicing. On Catalina Island, just off the Southern California coast, water scarcity is so severe that residents still rely almost entirely on a pair of desalination plants. Catalina is home to population of 4, 000 or so people and a beach playground for roughly a million annual visitors. Residents and businesses have had to contend with mandatory water rationing since 2013. Surrounded by ocean, the island has a major disadvantage to the rest of California: It can’t tap the melting Sierra Nevada snow that sustains mainland farms and cities during the warm months. That’s why officials have tightly restricted the use of Catalina’s main water source: an aquifer connected to the interior Middle Ranch Reservoir. The drumbeat of winter storms has helped to replenish the reservoir, but as of last week it was still only roughly a quarter full  —   and summer is looming. Alex Krowiak, a photographer and marine science educator who lives on Catalina, published a photo essay on the island’s water problems in News Deeply this month. He shared some of his pictures with us: (Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.) • A day after 14, 000 people were ordered to flee rising floodwaters in San Jose, the mayor acknowledged that the city had been ill prepared.

[The New York Times] Last week, the State Senate leader, Kevin de León, quietly introduced legislation that would require California to get all of its electricity from solar, wind and other renewable sources by 2045. The proposal significantly raises the bar set in 2015 when Gov. Jerry Brown signed legislation that aims for 50 percent use of renewables by 2030. We asked a few energy experts for their reactions to the plan. • Is the timeline plausible? It’s “ambitious,” said Felix Mormann, a faculty fellow at Stanford’s Steyer —  Taylor Center for Energy Policy and Finance. “But not implausible. ” “Last year, Germany was able to briefly meet 95 percent of the country’s electricity demand with renewables,” Mr. Mormann said. “But such peak events are still a long way from weaning an entire energy economy off all nonrenewable energy on a permanent basis. ” • What are the biggest challenges? Cost is one, said Ethan Elkind, director of the climate program at U. C. Berkeley’s Center for Law, Energy and the Environment. “Prices are coming down in all these technologies,” he said. “But we wouldn’t know how much it would cost. We also presumably would have to retire some existing power plants, so the ratepayer impacts are unknown. ” Another challenge is energy storage. A total reliance on renewable energy would require a major expansion of storage capacity for those times when the wind dies down and the sun fades, said Sadrul Ula, managing director of U. C. Riverside’s Winston Chung Global Energy Center. “Lithium batteries offer good potential,” he said. “But they’re still not there. ” • Is Mr. de León’s legislation encouraging?  Yes, said Dr. Ula, because it would essentially set the table for innovation. “Without that, we don’t discuss it. We don’t have a target,” he added. “Resources and development don’t get channeled unless there is a goal post. ” Want to submit a photo for possible publication? You can do it here.

466	PARIS  —   France’s embattled   presidential candidate, François Fillon, defiantly vowed on Wednesday to stay in the race, even as he announced that he would be formally charged in a widening embezzlement investigation. Mr. Fillon’s announcement, made at a news conference, added another element of uncertainty to an already unsettled campaign and increased the likelihood that France’s presidential race would be fought by two candidates from neither of the traditional mainstream parties. With formal charges looming that Mr. Fillon paid his wife and children hundreds of thousands of euros from the public payroll for little or no work, most analysts consider his chances of making it past the first round on April 23 in France’s   election to be diminished. That would leave the field open to the   candidate of the National Front, Marine Le Pen, whose rise in polls has sent jitters through financial markets and immigrant suburbs. Her likely contender is Emmanuel Macron, the former economy minister, who is running as the candidate of his own political movement. Mr. Macron, 39, is currently the favorite to defeat Ms. Le Pen, 48, in the second round on May 7. But Mr. Macron, a former Rothschild banker, is untested and inexperienced politically. His centrist program, some of it in line with the Socialist government he served, is viewed as unappealing to parts of the   electorate. The momentum, in most of the polls, is with her. A top National Front official, Florian Philippot, used a television interview after Mr. Fillon’s appearance largely to attack Mr. Macron  —   a clear indication that Ms. Le Pen already considers him her principal opponent. Even as Mr. Fillon, 62, is increasingly being written off, he has doubled down on his defense, yielding no ground to his critics. “It’s Fillon’s final bet,” said Laurent Bouvet, a political scientist at the University of Versailles St.   . “He’s playing all or nothing. The right, the heart of the right, the one that elected him and doesn’t want Le Pen to sweep the stakes, his bet is they won’t abandon him, in spite of all his legal problems. ” In another country, the shadow hanging over Mr. Fillon would most likely end a campaign for the highest office. But in France, legal problems, even serious ones, rarely end political careers, even though the electorate appears to be showing  —   in polls, at least  —   less tolerance than previously for accommodating financial misdeeds in high places. Even if he were to step aside, his   Republican Party has few good options. Mr. Fillon’s two main challengers in the party primary both campaigned under the shadow of past and current investigations. The   in the primary, Alain Juppé, was convicted in a phony jobs scheme undertaken while he worked at City Hall several decades ago. Nicolas Sarkozy, the former president, who finished third, is the subject of multiple investigations, and in February, he was ordered to stand trial on charges of illegally financing his failed 2012 presidential campaign. But Mr. Fillon’s problems, immediate and future, are different. He campaigned as the candidate of probity. That image has been shattered. And the sums reported to have been pocketed by his wife have shocked the French. Ms. Le Pen is not untainted by corruption accusations. But her legal difficulties, for now, have hardly dented her standing in the polls  —   partly because she has never cultivated an image of virtue, and partly because her principal adversary is the European Parliament in Strasbourg, in which she sits and which is widely unpopular, especially among her supporters. Her legal troubles are also more complex than Mr. Fillon’s, and she is not suspected of having personally benefited from any of the alleged financial wrongdoing. Last week, a top Le Pen aide was charged in an alleged phony jobs scheme. The aide was paid out of Parliament money but was thought to have spent her time working for the National Front. Another close associate of Ms. Le Pen’s, Frédéric Chatillon, has been charged with violating campaign finance laws. Mr. Chatillon’s ties to extremist groups on the far right have been closely documented in the French news media as well. Ms. Le Pen, invoking her parliamentary immunity, has refused a summons from the police who want to question her in the alleged phony jobs scheme, eliciting harsh criticism from government officials who accuse her of holding herself above the law. Like Mr. Fillon, she could still be formally charged. She and Mr. Fillon have struck remarkably similar defenses as the accusations have piled up around them. Both blamed the news media as well as the judicial system and civil servants for their problems. On Sunday, in a fiery speech in the western city of Nantes, Ms. Le Pen lashed out at judges, the legal system, civil servants and the news media, in a manner very similar to Mr. Fillon’s on Wednesday  —   and for that matter, President Trump’s in the United States. Ms. Le Pen said all of them were working in concert to undermine her. “The rule of law is the opposite of government by judges,” Ms. Le Pen told her cheering supporters. “Judges exist to apply the law,” she said, “not to subvert the will of the people. ” On Wednesday, Mr. Fillon struck a defiant tone in front of the reporters at his campaign headquarters in Paris, proclaiming his innocence and denouncing what he said was an unfair judicial and news media campaign intended to destroy his candidacy. “I didn’t embezzle any money,” Mr. Fillon told reporters. “I employed  —   like almost a third of the members of Parliament  —   family members because I knew I could count on their loyalty and competence. They helped me, and I will prove it. ” “From the beginning,” he continued, “I haven’t been treated as an ordinary suspect. ” And he insisted: “The rule of law has been systematically violated. The press has been an echo chamber for the prejudices of the prosecutors. ” Mr. Fillon said angrily that the presidential election was being “assassinated,” and he announced his determination to stay in it, because “only the voters can decide who will be president. ” The judicial screws have been steadily tightening on Mr. Fillon since newspaper reports in January  —   especially those in the satirical weekly Le Canard Enchaîné  —   said that for years he and his deputy had paid his wife hundreds of thousands of euros in state funds for a possible   job, and that his children had also benefited from the largess of Mr. Fillon, a former prime minister. In addition, Mr. Fillon is being scrutinized on suspicion of trafficking a high civilian honor, while prime minister, in exchange for money to his wife from a wealthy publisher friend. On Wednesday, in front of dozens of aides and members of his   party, Mr. Fillon told reporters he would answer a March 15 summons by the magistrates in the case, after which he is expected to be charged formally. The investigation will continue and Mr. Fillon could then stand trial, or the magistrates could drop the charges. Circumstances look increasingly unfavorable for him. In an article published on Wednesday before Mr. Fillon’s news conference, the French newspaper Le Monde described him as a “candidate in a bunker” who was hunched up and in his shell. It noted that he no longer took the train for campaign trips out of fear of being called out by protesters. He is often met by protesters banging pots, or “casseroles” in French  —   a slang term for corruption affairs. Sometimes the placards read, “Fake jobs for everybody. ”	1
414	Shopping for a phone plan can be as daunting as picking a health insurance package. The rates and options constantly change, and it feels impossible to make simple comparisons between carriers. Case in point: The best phone plans we recommended a year and a half ago are now obsolete because the wireless carriers have completely changed their offerings. The biggest change involves the   unlimited data plan. About five years ago, all the major carriers killed     data plans that let you browse the web, download music and post photos as much as you want in favor of plans that charge you by the gigabyte. But now   Sprint, ATT and, most recently, Verizon Wireless have resurrected unlimited data. As enticing as that may sound, unlimited is ideal for a small set of people. For everyone else, you may be paying for more than you need, and the plans come with major limitations on how you can use them. “The unlimited plan will confuse consumers even more because it’s not really unlimited,” said Toni Toikka, the chief executive of Alekstra, a research firm that analyzes wireless bills. “They think ‘O. K. it’s a great deal,’ but actually it’s not so. ” Still, it is a good time to consider a new phone plan. Phone manufacturers like Samsung Electronics, LG and Sony are expected to show new smartphones next week at Mobile World Congress, the annual trade show centered on mobile devices. To help narrow your options, The Wirecutter, the product recommendation site owned by The New York Times, named Verizon Wireless the best carrier, largely because it has the broadest network coverage and   service quality, along with generous data packages that are easy to understand, said Rob Pegoraro, who writes about phone carriers for The Wirecutter. The Wirecutter’s pick comes down to a simple fact: A smartphone is no good if it lacks a connection, so good coverage should be the top consideration when you select a plan. But choosing the best plan for you is not as simple as heading straight for a Verizon plan, Mr. Toikka said. Prices can fluctuate, and in some cases, ATT, the   carrier, offers a better deal on a network that is generally as good as Verizon’s. Here are recommendations we made with the help of Mr. Toikka for the best phone plans for individuals, couples, families and travelers. ATT’S   PLAN PRICE $60 a month WHY IT WINS On average, smartphone owners with tiered data plans used 2. 9 gigabytes of data per month last year, according to Cisco. At $60 a month, ATT’s   offering is large enough to suit the average smartphone owner’s needs. Verizon offers a   bucket for $60 a month, which may be too small for $75 a month it offers a   plan, which is a bit more than you probably need. VERIZON’S UNLIMITED DATA PLAN PRICE $80 a month WHY IT WINS If you use at least 10 gigabytes a month, consider yourself a power user. For a single phone line, Verizon’s $   unlimited data offering beats ATT’s $   unlimited plan. Verizon customers can also get a discount by enrolling in automatic payments, reducing the price of the unlimited plan to $80 a month. Only Verizon’s unlimited data plan includes the ability to tether, or share a smartphone’s cellular data with another device like a computer. Both plans share a limitation: After 22 gigabytes of use in a month, data speeds may be slowed. ATT’S SHARED   PLAN PRICE $100 a month WHY IT WINS ATT’s   shared data plan should have most couples covered since the average data consumption per person is three gigabytes a month. Priced at $100 a month, the plan is also more generous than Verizon’s   plan at $100 a month. VERIZON’S OR ATT’S UNLIMITED DATA PLAN PRICE $140 a month WHY THEY TIE A couple that uses at least 20 gigabytes a month would benefit from either ATT’s or Verizon’s unlimited plan, and both cost the same each month. Which to choose? Mr. Toikka recommends checking coverage maps for ATT and Verizon to see which carrier is better in your hometown. VERIZON’S UNLIMITED DATA PLAN PRICE $180 a month WHY IT WINS On average, a family of four will probably consume about 12 gigabytes a month. Verizon’s largest tiered data plan includes eight gigabytes a month, which can easily be surpassed. Verizon’s unlimited data plan costs $200 a month for four people, which can be reduced to $180 a month for families that enroll in automatic payments. Mr. Toikka warned that automatic payments might lead parents to overlook unexpected charges on their phone bills, so just make sure to closely monitor your bills. VERIZON’S AND ATT’S TRAVEL PLANS OR A FOREIGN SIM CARD PRICE $10 a day WHY THEY WIN Verizon and ATT customers can use a smartphone abroad in over 100 countries for an extra $10 a day on top of the rates for their normal phone plan. The main difference is that Verizon’s smartphones come unlocked, offering the flexibility of inserting a foreign SIM card and potentially paying even lower rates. By contrast, ATT’s smartphones come locked by default, meaning you will have to go through some hassle to unlock a device to use a foreign SIM card. Kelly Crummey, a Verizon spokeswoman, said, “Verizon’s coverage is second to none, and we have very competitively priced plans loaded with features, providing customers with incredible value. ” ATT said it “provides value to customers that our competitors can’t match. ” Switching to a new phone plan can be tedious and frustrating, and chances are you are happy with the one you have. But Mr. Pegoraro of The Wirecutter warned that sticking with a dated plan could make you miss out on options that offer better value or neat features like tethering. “Don’t assume that the plan you’ve been on is the one you should stay on,” he said.	1
174	Andy Hicks, owner of HIX Inc. a small health care technology consulting business in Denver, travels frequently. And as a gay man, he said, he’s enjoyed acceptance in many destinations  —   even in Cuba, where he traveled this year with his partner. “We didn’t know what to expect,” Mr. Hicks said. “We had zero problems. ” The travel industry offers gay travelers everything from special cruises and tours to   hotels. But there are still many places in the world, including many countries in the Middle East, Africa, Asia, the Caribbean and the Pacific, as well as Russia, where laws or social customs create an unwelcoming and unsafe environment for travelers who are lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender. More than 75 countries consider consensual   sexual relations a crime, and in about 10 countries a person could be put to death for being gay, according to the United States State Department. “Today, it is important for a L. G. B. T. person to understand the laws and how they are enforced and the culture of the countries and even cities where they visit,” said Bruce McIndoe, chief executive of iJet International, a travel risk management company. In an environment of religious extremism, he said, “individuals are more likely to lash out or take unilateral action against assumed members of the L. G. B. T. community. ” IJet, he said, has seen increased requests from clients to help prepare and protect their gay and transgender travelers after the mass shooting at an Orlando, Fla. nightclub last June and other episodes. Mr. Hicks, who has been to many   countries, recently returned from North Korea. “It was absolutely a nonissue,” he said. “You have to adapt, go with the flow and fit in as best you can. ” Yves Gentil, founder of DQMPR, a travel public relations and marketing agency, has been to nearly 50 countries for work and pleasure. “When you travel with your   you blend in a little bit more. But I’ve never had a problem, even in places like Saudi Arabia and Dubai. ” But then he visited Jamaica last year with his partner. “It was awkward to the point that I couldn’t wait to get out,” he said. “Not unsafe, but I just did not feel welcome. ” Jamaican law prohibits consensual   sexual conduct between men, according to the State Department. Sean Williams, a senior intelligence analyst for iJet, said the duration of a stay was an important safety factor. Business travelers typically spend a few days attending meetings and return to their hotels at night. “The risk is largely minimal. It’s no different from any other business traveler,” he said. But decisions made afterward when they go sightseeing and are not completely aware of the environment can, he said, “put their lives at risk. ” Gender expression is also a risk factor. “In some countries, they expect men to have a certain appearance if you are not dressed for your gender, they can arrest you,” Mr. Williams said. In other countries, homosexuality may be legal but not culturally accepted, “so if you end up in the wrong neighborhood, it can get you in trouble. ” As Americans, he said, “we have a strong tradition to be yourself, but in some countries the safest approach is to be the person they want you to be. ” Matthew Breen, editorial director of Logo and former editor in chief of The Advocate, two media organizations aimed at an L. G. B. T. audience, said gender identification and its potential dangers had informed his personal and professional travel policies. He does not write or assign stories, he said, about “destinations where L. G. B. T. s are persecuted or where our relationships are illegal. ” IJet recommends that transgender travelers take a few extra steps to smooth interactions with airport security: Ensure that the sex designation matches on all official documents and the traveler’s physical appearance carry letters from doctors in English and in the local language when traveling internationally and anticipate that body scanners may lead to security flagging. Still, many countries and cities have rolled out the welcome mat, even ones with strong religious and machismo cultures, like Spain, with its “live and let live” attitude, and Colombia, where the number of laws to support lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people and the speed in which they were recently passed were “quite impressive,” Mr. Williams said. Many mainstream travel companies, including Delta Air Lines and Marriott, have provided employees with   benefits and ensured that their   employees are adept at handling reservations for customers with   spouses and their families, experts say. And tourism boards around the globe routinely reach out to travelers. “It’s a message we are seeing loud and clear,” said John Tanzella, president and chief executive of the International Gay  Lesbian Travel Association, which offers trip planning tools. Apoorva N. Gandhi, vice president for multicultural affairs for Marriott International, said, “If you take great care of your associates, they will take great care of your customers. ” Marriott, like many major brands, trains   staff members about respectfully serving gay travelers. “We show a video scenario of a   couple at a hotel approaching the front desk for ” Mr. Gandhi said. “If the couple requested one bed, staff is directed to not make assumptions and do what is on the reservation without comment. ” Marriott, with IBM, sponsored the LGBT Guide to Business Travel, recently published by Man About World, a digital gay travel magazine. “We’ve learned from experience that L. G. B. T. businesspeople and entrepreneurs face added pressures not only in the workplace but especially when they travel for business,” the home page of the online publication says. The number of harmful episodes, arrests, prosecutions or deaths involving gay, bisexual or transgender travelers globally is not tracked, said Renato Sabbadini, executive director of the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association, a nonprofit human rights group in Geneva. “The overall trend is positive,” he said, but while many countries move forward, others backtrack. India decriminalized   sexual activities between men in 2009, but reversed the decision in 2013. “There is gradual change in societies all over the world,” Mr. Sabbadini added. “Maybe not as fast as it should, but it’s changing. ” Kevin Brosnahan, a press officer for the Bureau of Consular Affairs for the State Department, said many of its safety recommendations apply to all travelers: research a destination to be aware of local laws and customs register travel plans with the Smart Traveler Enrollment Program, a free State Department service, so the local United States Embassy can contact you in an emergency and make sure to have appropriate documents and medical and evacuation coverage. The department’s website has a special section for L. G. B. T. travelers with   and general tips, like to be discreet in rural areas of some countries, where there is a greater likelihood of problems, and to watch out for entrapment campaigns: “Police in some countries monitor websites, mobile apps, or meeting places, so be cautious connecting with the local community,” the website says. “Travelers who are well prepared often do the best,” Mr. Brosnahan said. Henry H. Harteveldt, a travel industry analyst and founder of Atmosphere Research Group, said that as a gay man he has never had a problem traveling for work to countries where homosexuality is illegal. “I knew where to ‘color within the lines’” to avoid potential problems, he said. But he added that he worried whether the changing political landscape in the United States might make travel more difficult. “For L. G. B. T. travelers, visiting some states will be like being in another country,” Mr. Harteveldt said. “And guess what? That’s going to have an impact on inbound tourism. ” Policies that curtail travel are “a ” Mr. Harteveldt said. “Destinations lose revenue and travelers lose valuable experiences. ” Some travelers remain undeterred. Do your homework, use social media, reach out to a destination’s local lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community and be prepared to respect different cultures, Mr. Gentil said. “But don’t be afraid to explore the world, because you just learn so much. ”	1
155	Making the most of the fractured political and media landscape, 20th Century Fox created a group of fake news sites as part of a viral marketing campaign for its new film “A Cure for Wellness. ” The sites displayed ads for the movie and slipped references to its plot alongside   stories about divisive topics like abortion, vaccines and President Trump. Fox used at least five fake news sites designed to look like local news media  —   The Sacramento Dispatch, Salt Lake City Guardian, Houston Leader, NY Morning Post and Indianapolis Gazette  —   to stir online outrage and drum up interest in the movie, which was produced by New Regency Productions and is to come out this week. It used other fake sites to promote the film as well, including one designed to resemble HealthCare. Gov and another for a fake bottled water company. Regency Enterprises and 20th Century Fox acknowledged their role in the fake news operation in a statement on Tuesday. “A Cure for Wellness is a movie about a ‘fake’ cure that makes people sicker,” the statement said. “As part of this campaign, a ‘fake’ wellness site, healthandwellness. co, was created and we partnered with a fake news creator to publish fake news. ” A Fox spokeswoman, Daria Vogel, declined to answer   questions on Tuesday, including whether the companies were using any other fake news sites to promote their film or whether they had used similar methods to promote movies in the past. The company is owned by Fox Entertainment Group, which also owns Fox News Channel and Fox Business Network. “A Cure for Wellness” was directed by Gore Verbinski and stars Dane DeHaan and Jason Isaacs, who in the past have both made jokes online about the phenomenon of fake news. The film opens on Friday and has received mostly negative reviews. One critic, Joe Dziemianowicz of The Daily News, described its plot as “preposterous gothic nonsense. ” The five sites known to be part of the fake news campaign were taken down after the story was  reported by BuzzFeed News on Tuesday. Users who entered their URLs were redirected to the film’s official website, but archived versions of some of their articles remained available online. The stories they published hit the viral sweet spot that has made fake news such an online force, even though most of them were not related to the movie. Some were shared thousands of times on social media by users who appeared to believe that they were factual news stories, and others were reposted by partisan websites like Red State Watcher. A partial list of headlines published by the movie studio’s campaign: • “Utah Senator Introduces Bill to Jail, Publicly Shame Women Who Receive Abortions” • “BOMBSHELL: Trump and Putin Spotted at Swiss Resort Prior to Election” • “LEAKED: Lady Gaga Halftime Performance to Feature Muslim Tribute” • “Trump Refuses to Provide California Federal Support in Midst of Natural Disaster, Cites Sanctuary Cities” • “California Legislature to Consider Tax Rebates for Women Who Get Abortions” Lynn Walsh, the president of the Society of Professional Journalists, said in an email that corporations had a responsibility to engage in “the ethical and responsible sharing of information no matter the intent or purpose. ” “In this country, we have the right to speak and publish information freely, and that’s a good thing,” Ms. Walsh said. “But if someone or a company is publishing incorrect information and trying to make it pass as actual news, we think that content should be properly labeled and very explicit that it is not true and does not contain actual facts. ” Those are guidelines that 20th Century Fox and New Regency Productions did not follow. “This absolutely crosses the line,” added Bonnie Patten, the executive director of the consumer watchdog TruthinAdvertising. org. “Using a fake news site to lure consumers into buying movie tickets is basically a form of deceptive marketing. ” One story published as part of their campaign claimed that Mr. Trump had issued a   ban on the vaccine for the measles, mumps and rubella. The report was published on The Houston Leader and debunked by the   website Snopes, which called the site “one of a series of fake news sites that masquerade as real news sites by emulating the appearance of   newspapers. ” Another story falsely reported that the American Medical Association had recognized a form of   anxiety or depression, “Trump Depression Disorder,” that it claimed affected one third of the country. It urged readers “to tweet #cureforwellness to raise awareness of the growing epidemic. ” Some of the film’s fake marketing websites remained active on Tuesday night, including the health and wellness website and the website for the fake bottled water company, which claimed to source its product from a Swiss village (that does not exist). The website designed to resemble HealthCare. gov (it is called HealthCureGov. com) also remained active. Ms. Vogel, the Fox spokeswoman, declined to explain why those websites had not been disabled. A phone call to the purported office of healthandwellness. co went unanswered, and emails to six people listed as its “managing editors” bounced back as undeliverable.	1
973	 “California just keeps on being hit by disaster after disaster as foretold in the Bible,” the Grammy Award-winning entertainer and businesswoman told guests at Dolly Parton’s Stampede, a dinner and entertainment evening.“Pestilence, and epidemics, and crime, and disease. And you know what? They don’t even realize what is happening to them. They are so corrupted, they can’t even see what is right in front of their eyes.”“First they had the drought that lasted years and years, killing off billions and billions of dollars in crops, and making the soil so incredibly dry that a large rainstorm could easily turn into a major flood.“Then they had the fires. Awful, awful fires. Historical, deadly fires. Thousands lost their homes, scores lost their lives and their livelihoods. Did you know the Thomas fire is still burning? In the winter!“[…]“And don’t forget the sexual abuse scandals rocking Hollywood. They are being punished for embracing Satan and rejecting God.” I know the money helps but most of all I want people to know we will always provide you a shoulder to lean on.” “We don’t try to shove anything down anybody’s throat. We are very open,” says Parton, who is well known for her support of the LGBT community. “So many of my businesspeople and my best friends are different faiths, and I work with them, live with them, love them. The gays and lesbians, they come to our parks. I think people just know I’m a very open and accepting person.“And in any religion we’re supposed to be that—we’re supposed to be kind…we’re not supposed to pass judgment. Our Bible says, ‘Judge not, lest ye be judged,’ and I believe in all those kinds of things.”	0

284	The Portuguese authorities have detained a former undercover C. I. A. officer whose extradition has been sought by Italy, where she faces a prison sentence over her role in the 2003 kidnapping of an Egyptian cleric as part of a secret United States rendition program. The former officer, Sabrina De Sousa, 60, was detained Monday night and is awaiting imminent extradition to Italy, one of her lawyers, Dario Bolognesi, said. Ms. De Sousa was among 26 Americans convicted of grabbing the cleric, Osama Moustafa Hassan Nasr, also known as Abu Omar, in Milan in February 2003. The operation was one of the   renditions ordered by the George W. Bush’s administration after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. Suspects were captured and taken to other countries for interrogation. The program was ended by the Barack Obama administration. Mr. Nasr was taken to a military base before being moved to Egypt, where he said he was tortured. In 2013, an Italian court sentenced him in absentia to six years in prison for   activities. At the time he was plucked off the streets, Ms. De Sousa, a native of India and a dual citizen of the United States and Portugal, was in Milan posing as a diplomat. She resigned from the C. I. A. in 2009. Convicted in absentia, she was sentenced to four years in prison. Despite facing possible arrest, she returned to Portugal in 2015. That October, she was briefly detained under a European arrest warrant and her passports were confiscated. She was arrested Monday as she was on her way to India to visit relatives, according to news accounts that cited her lawyer in Portugal. Mr. Bolognesi, her lawyer in Milan, said Tuesday that she emailed him Monday night to tell him that she had been arrested in Lisbon and was awaiting transfer to Italy. He said he had not heard from her since. Mr. Bolognesi met with Italian Justice Ministry officials in Rome on Tuesday, but he said that the officials told him that they “had not received any official communication” from the Portuguese authorities. At the ministry, Mr. Bolognesi reiterated his request that Ms. De Sousa be given a pardon, as had been granted to some of the officers involved in the rendition. He has also requested that she serve her time doing public service, rather than be jailed. Ms. De Sousa is likely to serve her prison sentence in Milan, Mr. Bolognesi said, because the European arrest warrant had been issued by prosecutors there. Her lawyer in Portugal, Manuel de Magalhães e Silva, could not be reached for comment. Ms. De Sousa’s case is among several related to rendition operations that have been brought to trial. In January, Britain’s Supreme Court ruled that Abdel Hakim Belhaj, a Libyan dissident who said he was abducted and tortured by American and British intelligence agents, could sue the British government and a former foreign secretary over his rendition.	1
437	WASHINGTON  —   Federal lawmakers excoriated international sports officials on Tuesday for what they called a bungled response to the Russian doping scandal, with delayed investigations, insufficient sanctions and a lack of interest in rooting out cheating that has tarnished the Olympic brand. During a   hearing called by a House subcommittee, Democrats and Republicans chastised representatives of the International Olympic Committee and the World   Agency, the regulator of drugs in sports. “What a broken system,” Representative Greg Walden, Republican of Oregon and chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, said, asking why WADA  —   to which the United States is the largest national contributor  —   took years to act on the multiple   tips it had received from within Russia, pursuing investigations only after news media reports. “It’s been a quagmire,” Mr. Walden said, criticizing officials’ “indecisive and inconsistent” responses to revelations that some 1, 000 Russian athletes were implicated in   doping schemes. Representatives of WADA and the I. O. C. spoke little, weathering relentless criticism with few rebuttals. “At these sort of things, you’re always a little frustrated you can’t say more,” Richard Budgett, the I. O. C. ’s medical and scientific director, said as he prepared to depart. Rob Koehler, the deputy director general of WADA, defended the organization’s response to the scandal, pointing to the independent investigations it had ultimately commissioned, which amassed evidence of the vast scope of Russia’s cheating that the I. O. C. and others are continuing to review. WADA’s president, Craig Reedie, is a member of the I. O. C. until August, he was a top executive with that organization as well. “If you continue to have sport overseeing investigations, overseeing compliance, overseeing itself  —   it’s the fox guarding the henhouse,” Travis Tygart, the United States’ top antidoping official, told the subcommittee. Mr. Tygart invoked an array of global reforms that he and a coalition of other national antidoping organizations had proposed in August. Most of all, he advocated making the global antidoping regulator more independent of sports organizations, empowering it to be an aggressive policeman. The United States Olympic Committee, which is politicking to host the 2024 Summer Games, had argued against holding a hearing last year, when Mr. Tygart and antidoping authorities from more than a dozen other nations were pressuring the I. O. C. to ban Russia from the 2016 Games after learning the nation’s antidoping lab chief had tampered with scores of urine samples at the 2014 Sochi Olympics. Representative Tim Murphy  —   Republican of Pennsylvania and the chairman of the subcommittee on oversight and investigations, which called the hearing  —   said Tuesday that the inquiry was justified and that Congress’s concern went beyond its $2 million annual contribution to the global regulator. “It isn’t just the money the United States puts into this,” Mr. Murphy said. “If it takes money to motivate things, fine, but the real reason is: I want sports to be fair. ” He said he also considered doping a public health issue. Testifying alongside the sports and antidoping authorities were two American Olympic medalists, the swimmer Michael Phelps and the   Adam Nelson, who told personal anecdotes. Some lawmakers took photographs of the athletes before and after the charged discussion. Mr. Phelps, the world’s most decorated Olympian, said he did not believe that he had ever competed in a clean field, and he echoed Mr. Tygart’s calls for making the antidoping regulator more independent. Mr. Nelson  —   who inherited a gold medal roughly a decade after he had competed, once a reporter had informed him that a competitor had been disqualified for doping  —   said he wanted to ensure officials would not “sweep this under the rug. ” He was presented with his gold medal in the food court of an Atlanta airport, a fact numerous representatives seized on, arguing for a ceremony to honor the dozens of athletes who have retroactively won medals because of the rash of doping disqualifications over the last year. Diana DeGette, Democrat of Colorado, drew parallels between Tuesday’s proceeding and hearings called in the early 2000s by the same subcommittee regarding the Salt Lake Olympics corruption scandal, in which American officials had bribed I. O. C. members to win the right to host the 2002 Games. After reading excerpts from an I. O. C. letter on the Russian doping scandal released last week, Ms. DeGette said, “This is the same kind of gobbledygook we got from the I. O. C. then. ” In the letter, addressed to various sports organizations, the I. O. C. had sought to differentiate between calling Russia’s widespread cheating “ ” and “institutional,” a major point of contention for Russian sports officials who have emphasized that President Vladimir V. Putin and his inner circle were not involved in the coordinated cheating. “They’re looking at angels dancing on the head of a pin, and I don’t even know what they’re talking about,” Ms. DeGette said. “The international sports community needs to realize we’re dealing with Russia and the honor system is simply not going to be enough. ”	1

243	On Friday, Kraft Heinz seemed determined to press ahead with a $143 billion takeover bid for Unilever, an ambitious campaign that would have put dozens of the   names in consumer households around the world under one roof. But less than 48 hours later, Kraft Heinz’s board  —   including Warren E. Buffett and the   billionaire Jorge Paulo Lemann  —   decided to walk away. The alternative would have been to pursue a public and possibly costly fight against Unilever, a bulwark of British and Dutch business. Instead, the two consumer goods giants said on Sunday that Kraft Heinz had withdrawn its takeover bid after an agreement on friendly terms. As a joint statement from the companies put it, “Kraft Heinz has the utmost respect for the culture, strategy and leadership of Unilever. ” The announcement swiftly ended what had been poised to become the biggest instance of consolidation within the food and consumer goods industry, at a time when giants in the fields have been looking to combine to command more space on grocery shelves. A combination of Kraft Heinz, itself the product of a   and Unilever would have sold everything from Heinz ketchup and Oscar Mayer hot dogs to Hellmann’s mayonnaise, Dove soap and Lipton tea. Kraft Heinz surprised the world when it disclosed on Friday, at the behest of the British merger regulator, that it had made a bid for Unilever. The disclosure came after a report in The Financial Times’s Alphaville blog said the two companies had held talks. Unilever quickly responded by saying that the $143 billion offer, a roughly 18 percent premium on the company’s closing stock price on Thursday, was too low and that it saw no reason to engage in talks. Kraft Heinz had approached Unilever only a few weeks before and had hoped to court its target in private, according to people with knowledge of the talks. Much of the food world had prepared for a potentially aggressive campaign by Kraft Heinz, whose backers at the Brazilian investment firm 3G Capital have long been known as swashbuckling deal makers eager to build up titans in the food and beverage industries. Along with Mr. Buffett, 3G had engineered a takeover of Heinz in 2013 and then Heinz’s merger with Kraft two years later, each in a   deal. By late last year, analysts and investors were speculating that Kraft Heinz was on the hunt for yet another major acquisition, although talk at the time centered on companies like Mondelez International, the former candy business of Kraft. Unilever, with its mix of food and household goods, had not been on many analysts’ radar screens, although they said its international profile and its strength in emerging markets would have complemented Kraft Heinz’s heavy focus on the United States. Shares of Kraft Heinz jumped more than 10 percent on Friday while those of Unilever rose 15 percent, suggesting that investors in both were eager for a union. While many on Wall Street had assumed that Kraft Heinz and 3G were prepared to fight for Unilever, Kraft Heinz and its backers had little desire to wage such a battle. That stands in contrast with how InBev, the   beer company, pursued Anheuser Busch in 2008: InBev was prepared to oust Anheuser’s board before agreeing to raise its offer and reach a friendly deal. Discussions among senior executives at Kraft Heinz and Unilever, as well as their advisers, underscored that Unilever was unwilling to proceed at any price. Moreover, the British government had expressed concern about the potential acquisition, citing the treatment of another British icon, Cadbury, after its takeover by Kraft in 2010, including accusations that Kraft reneged on promises to maintain hundreds of British jobs after the deal closed. The chairman of Parliament’s business committee, Iain Wright, said on Friday that “a lot of very good British companies will be subject to fire sales without taking into account their performance and quality. ” One concern was 3G’s traditional playbook of extreme   down to replacing workers’ personal printers with communal ones and selling off extravagances like corporate jets. Unilever has been known for years for its commitment to environmental sustainability, although its chief executive, Paul Polman, has recently pushed for more   initiatives as well. While Kraft Heinz had been prepared to make a number of concessions  —   including raising its offer and keeping Unilever’s headquarters in London and Rotterdam  —   the appetite among Mr. Buffett, Mr. Lemann and other directors for waging a fight waned, leading to the decision on Sunday morning to withdraw. That move came well ahead of a deadline set by the British takeover panel Kraft Heinz had to make a firm offer by March 17. “Kraft Heinz’s interest was made public at an extremely early stage,” Michael Mullen, a spokesman for Kraft Heinz, said in a statement. “Our intention was to proceed on a friendly basis, but it was made clear Unilever did not wish to pursue a transaction. ” Kraft Heinz has been advised by Lazard and the law firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton  Garrison Unilever received advice from the banks Centerview Partners, Morgan Stanley, UBS and Deutsche Bank.	1
250	ZVECAN, Kosovo  —   In the densely forested mountains along the contested frontier between Serbia and Kosovo, a patrol of American soldiers under NATO command trudged through snow and mud, keeping an eye out for smugglers or anyone else trying to cross the border. Given the bloody legacy of this area, the situation is quiet now, at least up here. It is down below, in Serbia and Kosovo, where old angers are resurfacing as the Balkan region that spawned so much suffering over the last century is again becoming dangerously restive. And once again, Russia is stoking tensions, as it seeks to exploit political fissures in an area that was once viewed as a triumph of muscular American diplomacy  —   but that now underscores the growing challenges facing NATO and the European Union. “Russia sees the West meddling in its backyard, and President Vladimir V. Putin wants to show he can reciprocate,” said Dimitar Bechev, an expert on Russia and the Balkans and head of the European Policy Institute in Sofia, Bulgaria. “They see the Balkans as the West’s underbelly, and they use it to throw their weight around and project power on the cheap. ” Nearly 18 years after a United   intervention ended Serb domination of Kosovo, the border patrols are part of the   mission in NATO history. Even as the European Union has made limited progress in brokering a political settlement between Kosovo and Serbia, the presence of NATO forces has maintained an uneasy peace, with animosity between the minority Serbs and majority Albanian inhabitants of Kosovo still palpable. Yet NATO is now confronting its own challenges, whether it is the seeming ambivalence of President Trump toward the alliance or an increasingly provocative Russia. The alliance has sent reinforcements to Poland and the Baltic States to counter Russian actions, but Russian involvement in the Balkans has gotten less attention. Russia has deep historical ties with Serbia and vehemently opposed NATO’s war over Kosovo in 1999. After an   bombing campaign, Serbia lost control over the region but continues to support Serbs there, vowing never to recognize the sovereignty of Kosovo, which it considers the cradle of the Serbian nation and of its Christian Orthodox faith. Mr. Putin has continued to back Serbia, as well as Serbs living in Bosnia and Herzegovina  —   and continued to dabble in the complex swirl of Balkan politics. For starters, Moscow supported Bosnian Serbs when they held a controversial referendum in November that could lead to more  —   or even full  —   independence from Sarajevo. A month later, Russia backed fringe opposition parties in delicate national elections in Macedonia, another former Yugoslav republic. The European Union had organized the election to help bring the country back from the brink of collapse. In Montenegro, Serbia’s tiny neighbor and a former Russian ally now set to join NATO, the authorities said they had foiled an October coup attempt that had been orchestrated by the Russians. Then in January, Moscow moved to help Serbia undermine Kosovo’s independence by supporting a series of provocations that have damaged diplomatic normalization efforts, known as the Brussels dialogue, that are sponsored by the European Union. That process had recently produced a small breakthrough, as Kosovo was about to get its own +383 calling code. Since Kosovo declared independence in 2008, however, the ethnic   government in the capital, Pristina, has failed to bring the predominantly Serb parts of the country north of the Ibar River under its control, including Mitrovica. But as Kosovars were celebrating this breakthrough, the Serbs erected a concrete wall separating the northern, predominantly Serb part of Mitrovica from the ethnic Albanians in the southern part. It was built on the Serbian side of the bridge that crosses the Ibar, a project that the European Union funded in hopes of linking the divided communities. European Union officials furiously demanded that the wall come down, but the Serbs remained defiant, forcing the official inauguration of the bridge to be postponed. This month, concrete blocks of the wall were bulldozed, but a metal barrier is still standing, blocking traffic and pedestrians. Most inflammatory, the Serbian government sent a   train from Belgrade to Mitrovica, adorning its coaches with signs declaring that “Kosovo is Serbia” in more than 20 languages. Kosovo stopped the train at the border, accusing Serbia of wanting to stage an invasion of northern Kosovo, modeled on Russia’s annexation of Crimea. Serbia, in turn, accused ethnic Albanians of laying mines along the railway tracks and planning a bombing campaign of Serbs and their holy sites. Serbia’s president, Tomislav Nikolic, who is thought to be backed by Russia as he seeks a second   term in the April election, threatened to send his troops back to Kosovo to protect the Serbs, if necessary. “If Serbs are killed, we’ll send the army to Kosovo,” Mr. Nikolic said after the train episode, which was ostensibly intended to restore a line that had been disconnected since the 1999 NATO bombing of the area. He warned officials in Pristina against attempting to provoke a conflict, saying it would “end badly. ” Russia’s ambassador to Serbia, Aleksandr Chepurin, wrote in a recent editorial in Serbia’s daily Politika that Moscow would support “Serbia in preventing attempts to create an artificial   of Kosovo. ” Milan Nic, a Balkan analyst at the GlobSec Policy Institute, a think tank in Bratislava, Slovakia, said that tough statements on Kosovo were common during Serbian elections but that Serbia could never improve relations with the European Union, let alone join it, by clinging to its former southern province. “If they truly want to improve lives of Serbs in Serbia,” Mr. Nic said, “they do need to give up on this illusion. ” Col. Corwin Lusk, the American commander of NATO’s multinational battle group in eastern Kosovo, agreed that the Serbian elections were fueling the angrier statements and that Russia was playing games, though he was skeptical that Moscow wanted a direct confrontation in the Balkans. “It would be very irrational behavior because it’s a fight they could not win,” he said. “It’s a fight nobody would walk away from without scars and bruises. ” Many ethnic Albanians and Serbs living in Kosovo fear another round of war. Roughly 120, 000 Serbs live in northern Kosovo, near the Serbian border, and mostly embrace the nationalistic fervor of Belgrade. But there are 70, 000 other Serbs scattered in southern Kosovo who feel more exposed to retaliation. In the town of Decani, in southwest Kosovo, 20 Serbian monks are holed up a   Serbian Orthodox monastery, which is recognized as a Unesco world heritage site and is being protected by NATO troops to prevent assaults from  . The abbot of the monastery, Father Sava Janjic, said the nationalistic talk from Serbia “often comes back to us like a boomerang. ” “Every time they call me from Serbia, they ask: ‘Is there war? Are they trying to kill you? ’’’ said Father Janjic, 52. “I tell them, ‘No, they are not.’ There is no war. I can’t lie. But the situation is far from rosy. ” NATO’s task in the region is deeply complex. Troop levels have dropped to about 5, 000 over the past decade, including 650 American soldiers, and their job includes border patrols as well as navigating the sensitivities of an ethnically divided region. In the absence of an army of their own, most ethnic Albanians see NATO troops as protectors of their state in Kosovo. “They are here to defend us from the Serbs when they want to storm back,” said Belkiza Sahatqiu, 46, a mother of three, who works in a shoe store in the   of Mitrovica. Many Serbs living in Kosovo, however, describe the alliance’s forces as occupiers more than protectors, said Lilijana Milic, who owns a farm along the highway between Mitrovica and Pristina. “They are not protecting anybody, certainly not us,” she said. “They came to occupy this land, and now they sit in their bases. Where were they when people were chased out of their homes in broad daylight?” At the same time, Ms. Milic blamed Serbian politicians in Belgrade for the misfortune of Kosovo’s Serbs. “They just talk, talk, talk, talk about defending us,” she said, “but all they ever do is take care of their own interests. ”	1
489	By now, even most of us over 35  —   old age, by Snapchat standards  —   are aware of the photo sharing and messaging app sweeping teenage and millennial America. Even if you have no interest in sending nude photos of yourself that   or in video lenses that enable you to vomit a rainbow, turn your head into a taco or make your eyes into glittering hearts, you may be wondering how such groundbreaking technology could be worth $34 billion. That was the value of Snapchat’s parent company, Snap Inc. after its first day of trading on Thursday. Its closing price of $24. 48 was 44 percent above the $17 offering price set late Wednesday. It’s the biggest initial public offering since Alibaba’s in 2014. At that price, Snap makes its much bigger rival Facebook  —   not to mention such internet stalwarts as Google, Amazon and even Netflix  —   look like   “value” stocks. Snap “looks tremendously overvalued to me,” said Brian Hamilton, a   of Sageworks, a financial analysis and valuation firm. Michael Nathanson, senior research analyst at MoffettNathanson, described Snap as a “field of dreams. ” Even with rosy growth forecasts, “at $22 billion, we’re looking at a stock trading at five to eight times estimated revenues in 2020,” he said before the valuation rose even higher. “The only companies in that domain are Facebook and Alibaba, and they have massive scale. And both of them are profitable. ” There’s no point in comparing Snap’s profits to any of those companies, since Snap doesn’t have any. The company lost $514. 6 million in 2016 and $372. 9 million the year before, according to the prospectus it filed in February. It has lost money every year since it began commercial operation in 2011 and has warned it may never earn a profit. The only comparable social media company that continues to lose money is Twitter, and no one at Snap wants anyone to compare it to Twitter. Twitter has struggled to add users and generate advertising revenue, even though it claims a user base of 319 million. It went public in 2013 at $26 a share. This week it was trading below $16 a share. So let’s be generous and ignore profit. How about revenue? Snap said it generated $404 million in sales in 2016. A valuation of $34 billion is about 84 times revenue. That’s six times as high as Facebook’s    ratio, which is 14. It’s 14 times as high as Google’s parent, Alphabet, which trades at just over six times revenue. Amazon trades at a mere three times. Even   Netflix trades at seven times. Compared with Snap, however, those are mature companies, whose growth rates have slowed somewhat as they’ve aged. As Mr. Nathanson and his fellow research analyst Perry Gold put it in a recent note to clients: “There is something brilliant about going public after only a few years of generating any revenue at all. The sky’s the limit and history is not a guide. ” To justify a valuation of even $25 billion, “you have to make some very lofty assumptions,” Mr. Hamilton said. “They would need to grow for the next 10 years at more than 50 percent every year with a profit margin of 25 percent, which is extremely high given that they are now losing money rapidly. ” He noted that very few companies had achieved such growth rates in the history of American business. But let’s ignore revenue, too. This is social media, after all, where “daily active users” and “engagement” are the coins of the realm. By the end of 2016, Snapchat had 158 million daily active users. By comparison, Instagram, probably the closest comparison and a formidable competitor to Snapchat, had about 30 million users when Facebook bought it in 2012 for what was then considered an   price of $1 billion. (Facebook had earlier tried to buy Snapchat for $3 billion, which its founders rejected  —   wisely, it now appears.) And $1 billion now looks like a bargain compared to what investors are paying for Snap. At $34 billion, each of Snap’s daily active users is worth $215, six and a half times per user what Facebook paid for Instagram. As of January, Instagram reported 300 million daily active users. At $215 each, the Instagram app alone would be valued today at $64. 5 billion. These are static numbers, and what Snap is selling investors is growth. According to Snap’s prospectus, Snapchat user growth was 48 percent in 2016, about the same as the year before. If it can pull that off again next year, it would reach an impressive 234 million users, though still short of Instagram. The Snapchat story “is all about growth,” Mr. Nathanson said. “It’s not about economics. ” But Snapchat’s growth slowed sharply in last year’s fourth quarter  —   just about the time Instagram started its own version of Stories, a popular Snapchat feature where users post a sequence of photos or videos. It added just five million new users after adding an average of 15 million in the first three quarters. By comparison, 150 million Instagram users are now using its Stories feature. That’s already nearly as many as Snapchat’s entire user base. How much more can Snapchat grow? Unless it can break out of its youthful demographic, it may already be reaching an upper limit. The Kaiser Foundation estimates that adults age 19 to 34 made up 22 percent of the United States population in 2015. That’s a little over 70 million. Snapchat already has nearly that many users in the United States. Maybe Snap can squeeze more revenue per user, even if its user base doesn’t grow all that much. It’s currently generating an average of $5. 83 a year per user in the United States compared with Facebook’s North American average of $12. 81, the MoffettNathanson analysis notes, suggesting plenty of room to grow. But even doubling revenue doesn’t get Snap close to a Facebook valuation. There are, of course, superhigh revenue and   assumptions that put Snap in the ballpark of successful and more established social media companies in valuation. Still, very few analysts have publicly said they believe Snap is undervalued at these levels (and I looked for some). The most bullish report I came across estimated that Snap could be worth as much as $30 billion. But that’s based on an extremely aggressive revenue estimate of $3. 8 billion in 2018. Mr. Gold said some investors were buying into the I. P. O. but not to hold Snap for the long term. “People are saying they’ll wait for a valuation that’s truly astronomical, and then take the other side of the bet,” he said. “They feel Snap will be richly valued out of the gate but possibly run into trouble over the next few quarters. ” Despite many of its somewhat juvenile features, at a more profound level Snapchat is changing the way young people communicate, substituting images for language. “Snapchat has built a better mousetrap,” Mr. Nathanson said. “It’s engaging, and it’s fun, especially for young people. ” That’s a story that obviously appealed to investors starving for the next hot social media company. Whether they’ll want to cash in quickly or hold their shares for the long term remains to be seen. “This looks and smells like Twitter to me,” Mr. Hamilton said. “I’m concerned that investors will have to wait a very long time, if ever, before they see any meaningful appreciation. ” About the best Mr. Nathanson and Mr. Gold could come up with: Snap’s valuation isn’t “patently crazy. ”	1

Anna Duncan, 37, gave birth to twin girls after being buried alive by her estranged husband who she says “did not want to pay such a large amount of child support.”… Reports state that as the family was saying their last goodbyes, they began hearing cries that sounded like an infant. “After the casket was lowered into the grave and covered with dirt, everyone who attended the funeral paid their last respects and tossed flowers onto the grave site,” said Clyde Harris. “But then we started hearing these cries, like babies crying. But there was no one around with an infant. They were accompanied by the screams of a woman.”… Harris said they immediately called 911 to report the suspicion once they realized the sound was coming from underground. They immediately demanded for the groundskeepers to dig up the soft dirt that covered the casket. They retrieved the coffin, which was pried open by firefighters and discovered Anna Livingston and two newborn twin girls inside.According to the official report, authorities stated that the discovery was a twisted plot to cover up an attempted murder crime. The original body of the deceased was switched last minute before the funeral with the body of the funeral director’s wife … Anna Livingston and her newborn twin girls are in stable condition recovering at a local hospital. Michael Livingston is being held on a $1 million bond and is facing attempted murder charges. The Jacksonville family has properly buried their son, Jerry Harris, in another nearby cemetery.	0
410	COLORADO SPRINGS  —   Executives at the United States   Agency here are agitating for a forceful response to Russia’s   doping program, lobbying international sports officials for more aggressive sanctions and for an overhaul of the global regulatory system. Executives at the nearby United States Olympic Committee’s headquarters have a different agenda. They are lobbying the same officials to award the 2024 Summer Games to Los Angeles, a likely financial boon for the committee, and have pressured Congress not to amplify the antidoping concerns. The competing agendas have put some of the most powerful sports executives in the world in conflict as the Olympic Committee enters the final months of its effort to bring the Games back to the United States for the first time since 2002. “Fighting with an organization responsible for giving future Olympic Games  —   it’s a big mistake,” said Vitaly Smirnov, an influential Russian Olympic official. He singled out criticisms by Travis Tygart, America’s antidoping chief, who has argued for severe penalties against Russia. “This gentleman is doing a very counterproductive job with respect to the Los Angeles bid,” Mr. Smirnov said. The choice for the 2024 Games is down to Los Angeles and Paris, and United States Olympic officials and other powerful interests involved with the bid have expressed concern to members of Congress that the   crusade could alienate some of the global officials who will make the decision. Mr. Tygart is to continue his crusade on Tuesday, when he is scheduled to address a House subcommittee about the doping scandal and the ways in which the global sports system could be improved. Testifying alongside him will be Michael Phelps, the world’s most decorated Olympian Adam Nelson, an American shot putter who was awarded a gold medal nearly a decade after his 2004 Olympic performance when a competitor was disqualified for doping as well as officials from the I. O. C. and the World   Agency, to which the United States contributes $2 million annually. Scott Blackmun, chief executive of the United States Olympic Committee, acknowledged that over the last year his organization had discussed the pending bid, along with a range of other issues, with both the House and the Senate. The Senate Commerce committee, which has not called a hearing but confirmed that its parallel inquiry was continuing, said on Saturday that it had “challenged suggestions that the 2024 bid is a legitimate rationale for stopping or delaying necessary oversight of doping in international competition. ” Mr. Blackmun said he thought a congressional hearing would be “more productive” after international sports officials had signaled how they planned to address the scandal, and that he supported lawmakers’ desire to stay informed. He also said he supported the fight for clean sports, but that his organization prefers a quieter approach. As the Russian doping scandal was roiling global sports weeks ahead of the Rio Olympics, with sports officials scrambling to respond to the pressure Mr. Tygart and others were applying in calling for extreme sanctions, the American Olympic committee worked to stave off congressional attention. “We were not saying hearings were inappropriate, but instead that right in front of the Olympic Games is not the right time,” Mr. Blackmun said. “Travis’s style, I would be lying if I told you it wasn’t having an impact,” he said of Mr. Tygart and the nation’s Olympic bid. “At the end of the day, he’s doing his job, and he’s doing it really well. Would we like him to be a little bit more of a   devil? Yes, we would. ” Mr. Tygart shrugged off the critiques of his methods. “It’s not unusual when you’re trying to do the right thing that there are attempts to pressure you to back off these fundamental values,” he said. Though based mere miles apart, the two prominent officials rarely cross paths in person. If ever, it might happen at the airport, since each travels frequently. They speak by phone every two to three months. While both organizations are aimed at serving American athletes, their pursuits are not always in harmony. The tension over the last year has not surprised American athletes who have expressed frustration at what they call global officials’ hesitancy to discipline Russia for systematic cheating. “The I. O. C. is responsible for the integrity of the Olympics and keeping it functioning, and they’re not doing it,” said Sarah Konrad, an American biathlete who until last month was chairwoman of the United State’s Olympic Committee’s athlete advisory council. “I know Scott Blackmun thinks more needs to be done by WADA and the I. O. C. but he’s not willing to get out and stand on a pulpit and say that because of the bid. ” Asked to respond to Ms. Konrad’s statement, Mr. Blackmun called her “a very smart person. ” The host for the 2024 Games will be determined in September by secret ballots cast by the roughly 100 members of the International Olympic Committee, representing countries from Brazil to Liechtenstein to North Korea. Russia has three members. The global officials are accustomed to autonomy and may bristle at this week’s scrutiny from the American government, prompting some like Ms. Konrad to wonder if a hearing could cause more harm than good. “We want the I. O. C. to be independent, nothing to do with politics,” Gerhard Heiberg, a longtime I. O. C. member from Norway, said. “That is of course not possible, but it could be very difficult to have one nation getting involved in how we are handling doping and putting pressure on us. ” Mr. Heiberg said that whims often guided the individual votes of I. O. C.  . “On Sept. 13, when we choose between Los Angeles and Paris, a lot of people will vote with their hearts,” he said. Congress’s interest in the doping scandal, Mr. Tygart’s activism and the United States’ inquiries into international sports corruption  —   from the FIFA case focused on soccer’s global governing body to a Justice Department investigation into the Russian doping scandal  —   could inform how some of his colleagues voted, he said. “It could affect some members  —   ‘you want the Games, fine, but don’t mix things up,’ ” Mr. Heiberg said.   Kasper of Switzerland, who sits on the I. O. C. ’s executive board, also said that Mr. Tygart’s outspokenness, coupled with Donald J. Trump’s election, could diminish Los Angeles’s attractiveness as host. Mr. Trump has expressed public support for the Olympic bid, though some of his policies  —   most notably on immigration, including his recent executive order barring visitors from seven predominantly Muslim nations  —   have caused concern among sports officials. Mr. Blackmun said the American Olympic committee had received assurances from the State Department and Homeland Security that global athletes and officials would have no trouble entering the United States in 2024. “The Games are more than seven years away at this point and, candidly, the I. O. C. has been through this a number of times,” Mr. Blackmun said. “I think they have the ability to look past what I would call the   political or situational environment. ” As a dwindling number of cities have expressed willingness to host the Olympics, the I. O. C. ’s president has suggested he would like to see fewer “losers” in the bid process, setting off recent speculation that both Paris and Los Angeles could be chosen at the same time to host two future Summer Olympics, for 2024 and 2028. Even so, Mr. Blackmun emphasized last week in his   office in downtown Colorado Springs, decorated with oversize photographs of American athletes marching in various opening ceremonies, that the United States was exclusively focused on hosting in 2024. If Los Angeles receives the bid, Mr. Blackmun said, the Summer Games could make an example of the country’s strong antidoping system. A   drive north, Mr. Tygart walked into the antidoping agency’s staff kitchen and pointed to an array of motivational words decorating the wall. “Courage,” he said, gesturing above the refrigerator. “That’s the most important one. ” Mr. Tygart’s colleague Edwin Moses  —   an Olympic medalist and chairman of the American antidoping agency’s board  —   expressed consternation that the agency’s principled positions might undermine the bid. “If standing up for the rights of athletes and fair play somehow makes a country less likely to host the Olympic Games  —   wow,” he said. “That says about all you need to know about that process. It’s also exactly why sport has no business trying to police itself. ” Ms. Konrad, the Olympic biathlete, said she appreciated that Mr. Tygart had sacrificed a cozy relationship with Olympic officials, displaying the independence he and others have called for regulators to embrace at the global level. “I can sympathize with people showing restraint because they want L. A. to happen,” Ms. Konrad said. “But a clean playing field is more important to me than a home playing field. ”	1
215	MELBOURNE, Fla.  —   President Trump will interview four candidates on Sunday to replace his dismissed national security adviser, three of them military veterans, but one of America’s most prominent retired generals, whose name had been floated, is not in the running. A White House spokesman said on Saturday that Mr. Trump would speak with Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster, a prominent military strategist Lt. Gen. Robert L. Caslen Jr. the superintendent of the United States Military Academy at West Point and Keith Kellogg, a retired lieutenant general already serving as acting national security adviser. Mr. Trump, who is spending the weekend in Florida, will also interview John R. Bolton, who served as President George W. Bush’s ambassador to the United Nations and has previously been considered for deputy secretary of state. Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, told reporters that “potentially others” might also be considered but that David H. Petraeus, the retired general and former C. I. A. director, was not a candidate. The national security adviser is a crucial figure in any White House, but Mr. Trump has struggled to find the right person to fill the post. His first national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn, a retired lieutenant general, lasted only 24 days before Mr. Trump requested his resignation for misinforming Vice President Mike Pence about the nature of a conversation with Russia’s ambassador to the United States. The list of candidates now being considered reflects Mr. Trump’s continued interest in bringing top military officers into his administration. Other generals have served as national security adviser  —   notably Brent Scowcroft and Colin L. Powell  —   but the president seems reluctant to cast a net much wider than the officer corps. At a news conference on Thursday, Mr. Trump said he was comfortable dismissing Mr. Flynn in part because he had “somebody that I think will be outstanding for the position. ” He seemed to be referring to Robert S. Harward, a retired vice admiral and Navy SEAL, but Mr. Harward later turned down the job. The search for a new adviser has been complicated by uncertainty in the foreign policy world about the role of Stephen K. Bannon, the president’s chief strategist, who has been given a seat on a   National Security Council committee. Mr. Harward was said to have expressed concern about how much autonomy he would have had. Mr. Petraeus was said to have similar concerns, although some close to Mr. Trump said he was never a serious candidate. A White House official, who like others insisted on anonymity to discuss the search more candidly, rejected reports that Mr. Harward had been concerned about a lack of autonomy in the role, insisting that he had been promised full personnel and structuring authority to clean house. Mr. Bannon was Mr. Harward’s biggest supporter in the West Wing for the national security adviser role, whisking him into a secret meeting with the president on Monday. On Saturday evening, a senior administration official described General McMaster and General Caslen as the leading candidates. The one candidate who has not emerged from the military is Mr. Bolton, an outspoken conservative respected by Mr. Bannon, although it is unclear if Mr. Bannon is supporting him for the national security job. Mr. Bolton does have support from two important donors to Mr. Trump, according to people briefed on the White House process: the casino magnate Sheldon G. Adelson and the philanthropist Rebekah Mercer. Mr. Bolton shares Mr. Trump’s strong antipathy toward the Iran nuclear deal negotiated by former President Barack Obama, and he would presumably continue the tough approach begun by Mr. Flynn of pressuring Tehran over its ballistic missile program and its sponsorship of terrorist groups. But Mr. Bolton has also taken a stronger position on Russia than Mr. Trump or Mr. Flynn. In a recent   article in The Wall Street Journal, he seemed to try to reconcile that by agreeing with Mr. Trump’s criticism of Mr. Obama’s New Start arms control treaty with Russia. Mr. Bolton is a favorite of conservatives but an adversary of Democrats, who blocked him for confirmation as ambassador to the United Nations. Mr. Bush used his recess appointment power to install him anyway, but came to regret it when Mr. Bolton, after leaving office, became a harsh critic for what he said was the president’s unwise willingness to negotiate with North Korea. General McMaster, a highly decorated Army officer, is considered one of the military’s leading intellectuals. He earned something of a cult status in the military as a young major for his influential 1997 book, “Dereliction of Duty,” an indictment of the military’s failure to stand up to Lyndon B. Johnson and other civilian leaders during the Vietnam War. But General McMaster has also proved himself in the field, leading a successful counterinsurgency effort in 2005 to secure Tal Afar in northern Iraq. He was critical of the way the Bush administration went to war in Iraq and became an important thinker behind the strategy change that helped turn the war around. Foreign Policy magazine called him “the brain behind Petraeus. ” General McMaster is now the director of the Army Capabilities Integration Center at Fort Eustis in Virginia. General Caslen, who was in the Pentagon on Sept. 11, 2001, and went back into the building after it was hit, served in key roles in Iraq and Afghanistan. He was commander of the 25th Infantry Division (Light) and commander of coalition forces in northern Iraq. A West Point graduate, he took command of the military academy in 2013. Mr. Bannon is a former naval officer, and his daughter graduated from West Point. Mr. Kellogg served for 36 years in the Army, including two tours in Vietnam, where he earned the Silver Star and other medals. He commanded the 82nd Airborne Division and was chief operating officer of the Coalition Provisional Authority in Iraq before retiring in 2003. He advised Mr. Trump on foreign policy during his campaign and was named chief of staff at the National Security Council.	1

7	(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the  .) Good evening. Here’s the latest. 1. A federal appeals court refused to reinstate President Trump’s targeted travel ban, delivering a stinging judicial rebuke to his administration. The ruling focused on the narrow question of whether the ban should be blocked while courts consider its lawfulness, and is likely to be quickly appealed to the Supreme Court. The executive order suspended travel from seven predominantly Muslim countries and limited the nation’s refugee program. Above, families were reunited in Chicago this week. _____ 2. An “unusually fast and intense” snowstorm shut down cities across the Northeast. Up to 14 inches fell across the New York area, and parts of New England could get up to 18 inches. Some places got a rare “thundersnow,” which is   …     exactly what it sounds like. _____ 3. Concerns over conflicts of interest pushed the White House to “counsel” a top Trump adviser. Kellyanne Conway may have violated federal ethics rules by urging people to buy Ivanka Trump’s fashion products during a television appearance. That came just a day after Mr. Trump lashed out at Nordstrom for dropping his daughter’s line of clothes, jewelry and accessories. On today’s episode of our podcast, The Daily, we get an influential investor’s take on the postelection market euphoria and discuss how the Republicans empowered Senator Elizabeth Warren. Listen here if you’re on a computer, here if you have an iOS device or here for an Android device. _____ 4. A    Arizona woman who illegally crossed the border from Mexico when she was 14 was deported amid protests and tears. The immigration officials she met with regularly for years declined to carry out a deportation order  —   until the Trump administration broadened the definition of “criminal alien,” which may affect the majority of unauthorized immigrants. “The only crime my mother committed was to go to work to give a better life for her children,” her daughter said. _____ 5. Friday is the anniversary of the 1979 revolution that established the Islamic Republic of Iran, but some Iranians don’t want to join in the tradition, cherished among   of burning American flags. Many Iranians were heartened by the backlash to Mr. Trump’s travel ban, which targeted Iran and six other nations. “Look at the kindness Iranians received at U. S. airports by those protesting Trump,” said one. “We insult those people when we burn their flag. ” _____ 6. Mr. Trump and his advisers appear to be curtailing their provocative   moves as they develop a strategy on the   conflict that enlists Arab nations like Saudi Arabia and Egypt to break years of gridlock. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, who is set to visit the United States next week, has been focused on trying to counter the rise of Iran with the same regional allies. _____ 7. Mystery assassinations in eastern Ukraine: Half a dozen commanders in the   separatist army have been killed far from the front lines since 2015. Ukrainian officials deny any involvement, and say the deaths could be infighting  —   or efforts by Russia to consolidate control by eliminating erratic, if popular, local commanders on their own side. _____ 8. They don’t talk about it much, but almost half of all Americans in their early 20s get parental help to pay the rent. Those in the art and design fields get the most help, an average of $3, 600 a year. It’s a new example of how economic advantages continue well into the opening chapters of adulthood, giving young people from wealthier families more time to develop skills that can lead to higher incomes. _____ 9. Bob Costas is ending his   run as NBC’s   Olympics host. When the network goes to the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea, next year, the baton will be passed to Mike Tirico, who recently joined NBC from ESPN. Mr. Costas will also scale back his other work at NBC, and focus on offering commentary and features for major events. _____ 10. Finally, what makes a good dancer? Researchers asked 200 people to rate 39 avatars based on female dancers, an experiment in what they call “social cognition”  —   how bits of perceptual information feed large inferences. The conclusion: It’s all about the hips. One of the study’s authors helpfully suggested that “there is no harm in trying to throw different moves at the disco. ” _____ Photographs may appear out of order for some readers.

81	Over the weekend, The Times published this investigation into the agency that Michael T. Flynn was leading before he stepped down. Read our updated article on Mr. Flynn’s resignation.  WASHINGTON  —   These are chaotic and anxious days inside the National Security Council, the traditional center of management for a president’s dealings with an uncertain world. Three weeks into the Trump administration, council staff members get up in the morning, read President Trump’s Twitter posts and struggle to make policy to fit them. Most are kept in the dark about what Mr. Trump tells foreign leaders in his phone calls. Some staff members have turned to encrypted communications to talk with their colleagues, after hearing that Mr. Trump’s top advisers are considering an “insider threat” program that could result in monitoring cellphones and emails for leaks. The national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn, has hunkered down since investigators began looking into what, exactly, he told the Russian ambassador to the United States about the lifting of sanctions imposed in the last days of the Obama administration, and whether he misled Vice President Mike Pence about those conversations. His survival in the job may hang in the balance. Although Mr. Trump suggested to reporters aboard Air Force One on Friday that he was unaware of the latest questions swirling around Mr. Flynn’s dealings with Russia, aides said over the weekend in Florida  —   where Mr. Flynn accompanied the president and Japan’s prime minister, Shinzo Abe  —   that Mr. Trump was closely monitoring the reaction to Mr. Flynn’s conversations. There are transcripts of a conversation in at least one phone call, recorded by American intelligence agencies that wiretap foreign diplomats, which may determine Mr. Flynn’s future. Stephen Miller, the White House senior policy adviser, was circumspect on Sunday about Mr. Flynn’s future. Mr. Miller said on NBC’s “Meet the Press” that possibly misleading the vice president on communications with Russia was “a sensitive matter. ” Asked if Mr. Trump still had confidence in Mr. Flynn, Mr. Miller responded, “That’s a question for the president. ” This account of life inside the council  —   offices made up of several hundred career civil servants who advise the president on counterterrorism, foreign policy, nuclear deterrence and other issues of war and peace  —   is based on conversations with more than two dozen current and former council staff members and others throughout the government. All spoke on the condition that they not be quoted by name for fear of reprisals. “It’s so far a very dysfunctional N. S. C. ,” Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, the senior Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said in a telephone interview. In a telephone conversation on Sunday afternoon, K. T. McFarland, the deputy national security adviser, said that early meetings of the council were brisker, tighter and more decisive than in the past, but she acknowledged that career officials were on edge. “Not only is this a new administration, but it is a different party, and Donald Trump was elected by people who wanted the status quo thrown out,” said Ms. McFarland, a veteran of the Reagan administration who most recently worked for Fox News. “I think it would be a mistake if we didn’t have consternation about the changes  —   most of the cabinet haven’t even been in government before. ” There is always a shakedown period for any new National Security Council, whose staff is drawn from the State Department, the Pentagon and other agencies and is largely housed opposite the White House in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building. President Barack Obama replaced his first national security adviser, Gen. James Jones, a   former supreme allied commander in Europe, after concluding that the general was a bad fit for the administration. The first years of President George W. Bush’s council were defined by clashes among experienced bureaucratic infighters  —   Dick Cheney, Donald Rumsfeld and Colin Powell among them  —   and by decisions that often took place outside official channels. But what is happening under the Trump White House is different, officials say, and not just because of Mr. Trump’s Twitter foreign policy. (Two officials said that at one recent meeting, there was talk of feeding suggested Twitter posts to the president so the council’s staff would have greater influence.) A number of staff members who did not want to work for Mr. Trump have returned to their regular agencies, leaving a    hole in the experienced bureaucracy. Many of those who remain, who see themselves as apolitical civil servants, have been disturbed by displays of overt partisanship. At an   meeting about two weeks into the new administration, Ms. McFarland told the group it needed to “make America great again,” numerous staff members who were there said. New Trump appointees are carrying coffee mugs with that Trump campaign slogan into meetings with foreign counterparts, one staff member said. Nervous staff members recently met late at night at a bar a few blocks from the White House and talked about purging their social media accounts of any suggestion of   sentiments. Mr. Trump’s council staff draws heavily from the military  —   often people who had ties to Mr. Flynn when he served as a senior military intelligence officer and then as the director of the Defense Intelligence Agency before he was forced out of the job. Many of the first ideas that have been floated have involved military, rather than diplomatic, initiatives. Last week, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis was exploring whether the Navy could intercept and board an Iranian ship to look for contraband weapons possibly headed to Houthi fighters in Yemen. The potential interdiction seemed in keeping with recent instructions from Mr. Trump, reinforced in meetings with Mr. Mattis and Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson, to crack down on Iran’s support of terrorism. But the ship was in international waters in the Arabian Sea, according to two officials. Mr. Mattis ultimately decided to set the operation aside, at least for now. White House officials said that was because news of the impending operation leaked, a threat to security that has helped fuel the move for the insider threat program. But others doubt whether there was enough basis in international law, and wondered what would happen if, in the early days of an administration that has already seen one botched military action in Yemen, American forces were suddenly in a firefight with the Iranian Navy. Ms. McFarland often draws on her television experience to make clear to officials that they need to make their points in council meetings quickly, and she signals when to wrap up, several participants said. And while Mr. Obama liked policy option papers that were three to six   pages, council staff members are now being told to keep papers to a single page, with lots of graphics and maps. “The president likes maps,” one official said. Paper flow, the lifeblood of the bureaucracy, has been erratic. A senior Pentagon official saw a draft executive order on prisoner treatment only through unofficial rumors and news media leaks. He called the White House to find out if it was real and said he had concerns but was not sure if he was authorized to make suggestions. Officials said that the absence of an orderly flow of council documents, ultimately the responsibility of Mr. Flynn, explained why Mr. Mattis and Mike Pompeo, the director of the C. I. A. never saw a number of Mr. Trump’s executive orders before they were issued. One order had to be amended after it was made public, to reassure Mr. Pompeo that he had a regular seat on the council. White House officials say that was a blunder, and that the process of reviewing executive orders has been straightened out by Reince Priebus, the White House chief of staff. Still, Mr. Flynn presents additional complications beyond his conversations with the Russian ambassador. His aides say he is insecure about whether his unfettered access to Mr. Trump during the campaign is being scaled back and about a shadow council created by Stephen K. Bannon, Mr. Trump’s top strategist, who was invited to attend meetings of the “principals committee” of the council two weeks ago. For his part, Mr. Bannon sees the United States as headed toward an inevitable confrontation with two adversaries  —   China and Iran. Mr. Flynn finds himself in a continuing conflict with the intelligence agencies, whose work on Russia and other issues he has dismissed as subpar and politically biased. Last week, in an incident first reported by Politico, one of Mr. Flynn’s top deputies, Robin Townley, was denied the   security clearance he needed before he could take up his job on the council as the senior director for Africa. It was not clear what in Mr. Townley’s past disqualified him, and in every administration some officials are denied clearances. But some saw the intelligence community striking back. Two people with direct access to the White House leadership said Mr. Flynn was surprised to learn that the State Department and Congress play a pivotal role in foreign arms sales and technology transfers. So it was a rude discovery that Mr. Trump could not simply order the Pentagon to send more weapons to Saudi Arabia  —   which is clamoring to have an Obama administration ban on the sale of cluster bombs and   weapons lifted  —   or to deliver bigger weapons packages to the United Arab Emirates. Several staff members said that Mr. Flynn, who was a career Army officer, was not familiar with how to call up the National Guard in an emergency  —   for, say, a natural disaster like Hurricane Katrina or the detonation of a dirty bomb in an American city. At the   meeting, Mr. Flynn talked about the importance of a balanced work life, taking care of family, and using the time at the council to gain experience that would help staff members in other parts of the government. At one point, the crowd was asked for a show of hands of how many expected to be working at the White House in a year. Mr. Flynn turned to Ms. McFarland and, in what seemed to be a   joke, said, “I wonder if we’ll be here a year from now?”	1
